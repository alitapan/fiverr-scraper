voters",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:25 am",miiila,2,"Business did fluctuate a bit but not so much more than within a similar time period pre COVID, and I was “busy enough”, also, my prices are very fair, figuring in Fiverr’s cut and all (and buyers who know what they are doing, or Google a bit to see what realistic prices and delivery times for quality work might be, should get to the same conclusion) so, no, I haven’t.
I also have many return and regular customers, and while some were affected due to the nature of their business, others weren’t, or even had more to do, that probably evened it out a bit.
My plan in case I’d have had more free time than I’d have liked for more than a month was actually not to lower my prices but to set up some new gigs and do more “offline” and with my own site.
I guess lowering one’s prices might work in a pinch but if they are already fair or even a bit (or much) lower than they should be, it can be problematic to rise them again when it becomes unsustainable.
In addition to that, I have to pay exactly the same for everything myself, partly even more (groceries have become more expensive), so lowering my own prices while my COL stays the same or is even higher, seems a bad idea, unless I’d not get enough orders as it is.
I’ll be flexible if I have to, but for now, I’m happier with cutting down on my non-essential expenses, doing an order ot two less per week, and having more time for other things than work.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:17 am",2020-07-29 18:03:48.349092

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.

“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

And because of pandemic there isn’t much to do now it’s time to hold and rethink our actions, if you don’t have orders you can always sharpen your skills, I don’t like your sarcastic notice about fiverr’s answer, as fiverr do a lot to make this platform best possible place for all of us by promoting and attracting as many customers as it’s possible. So what we do with our work to support fiverr’s growth? I can’t understand people who think that fiverr owe them anything. Can I ask you why you don’t have buyers? Why you don’t make them return? You need to provide the best possible work to make them forget about other places, you must give them quality that they will not get in other places I’m not speaking about price believe me if you have money you will buy a Porsche rather than Fiat if you know what I mean so every customer ready to pay for a good product as they understand that with that they will look better and can success, every time lowering prices and giving even low quality product isn’t the way we should try to keep on fiverr. I recommend to read more and study better to become a better skilled in what you do every time you have a time this is the only way to attract more customers. In these days the whole world is fighting with unseen virus which is not a joke and because of massive isolation it’s very natural that everything will loose the grip and become more slow so imagine if every seller who have a drop on sales will message to fiverr and ask why they aren’t get as many orders as they want? I have printed flyers and hire 2 girls to share them with people I buy a places to make advertisements I go to different forums and workshops I meet people and tell about my business on fiverr I try to advertise as much as I can my gigs. I’m not a specialist in this maybe I do many wrong things but I try at least I don’t seat and ask fiverr to give me a buyers I have a buyers outside of fiverr I invite them I recommend them to use fiverr I’m an artist designer I never do marketing I don’t understand much and it costs me a lot of energy and I feel not comfortable doing that many things but I know that if each of us will try to do something which will help fiverr that will be only good for all of us.

What do you think guys??",N/A,1,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,7,"First of all, Please accept my deepest condolence. Recently, Armenia reports first death related to coronavirus which is pretty sad
You’re right, If I’m not getting any orders then there is something wrong with me. Maybe my gigs, images, title, keywords & my skills are not not working for me. I will change them & improve my gigs & skills soon. But please note: I’m not bashing Fiverr here & I’m not complaining about not getting orders
I started this discussion to verify that if (COVID-19) is the reason for not getting any sales right now. And yes I was right. (This Coronavirus pandemic changed the world including Fiverr) Usually I receive 5-6 messages per day or sometimes 2-3 orders a day. But from last 26 days, No one is contacting me & no one is ordering my gigs which was pretty strange for me that’s why I started this.
Repeat customers are the reason of my survival on Fiverr. I’m a seller here for more than 6 years now so yeah I know what I’m doing here. I often advertise & promote my gigs on different platforms & yes on on my social media accounts as well. I even have a “Marketing budget” for my gigs. Yes, I usually invest my 20% earning on advertising which is essential for my online business. When I’ve started in 2014 the competition for me was not that strong. Yes “My Main Job was to speed up wordpress sites much faster” & that time no one was competing with me.
You can go to Fiverr & just search this: wordpress speed optimization (You will find 100+ gigs about speed optimization) Yeah exactly like the logo ones. Everyone is a expert in this field now I’m talking about wordpress speed optimization here.
2014 (When I was just 18-19 years old kid) 2020 (When I’m 24 right now & much for experienced & professional)
So yeah I improved a lot & yes even my personal life is changed now
I stopped working here for more than 2 years because of some personal reasons but when I started again in 2019 everything about this marketplace was changed. Fiverr PRO area, You can take skills & other tests. So I was happy that they’re improving this marketplace but then I activated the paused gigs & realized that no one is messaging me. I searched my gigs & found out that every other seller is offering my services, which was just shocking for me. I invested my time & money on my profile & then orders start coming again. I even messaged my previous buyers so they can know that I’m back here
Everything was normal that time then in January 2020 my impressions, views & clicks were decreasing every single day. (Strange) right!!
I contacted Fiverr support & they told me that everything is fine with your account but I still told them to check it again & they replied: Everything is normal but I can feel that everything was not normal that time. February was a pretty good month for me but then this March month destroyed everything
I can’t even express my feelings with you, I’m so sad & worried right now. & please don’t say sorry to me & yeah I don’t take anything personally so don’t worry

“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

No no, Please try to understand that main purpose was to show the impact of the coronavirus on businesses.
To be honest, I am getting sick of people trying to remind me of the impact on businesses. I have a friend who secured the lease on a restaurant just before this. He was due to open in a few days, can’t, and is still contractually obliged to pay $1,200 rent each month for the next year.
I know a couple who own a shop who can’t open and are stuck in a similar boat with no income coming in.
I use a mobile grocer to buy my groceries who is now no longer able to do his rounds, and the last time he was here last week, there was a pretty depressed guy I know asking how many individual eggs he could buy with what change he had.
I live on a street of bar and restaurant workers, none of whom are going to be able to pay their rent very soon. Any who are foreign have also been told that if they do not have jobs or are not economically self sufficient, they will need to go back to their own countries by the government. - Despite the only airport being closed.
Now it seems like every time I come here, I have someone I do not know from Adam asking me to help them out, think of them, or do something to help fight Covid-19 by donating my time or skills for free to nondescript charitable causes.
I’m very sorry that you are experiencing hardship. However, like it or not, nobody here can help. It is really as simple as that and the worst thing you can do is continue going around in circles asking people to care or help. Instead, you need to figure out how to help yourself.

I get that. Also, I am sincerely sorry that you are in a tight spot. However, to be very blunt, a lot of people are and things are only going to get worse. In this case, you need to start thinking outside the box.
People and businesses in your area will be struggling right now. Is it possible that you could help by reaching out to them directly and offering budget-friendly wen development,graphic design, or marketing services, even if you outsource some of these?
You would literally just have to send a letters to each one. (No one reads emails, but letters can still work.)
That is just one basic idea that may not be applicable to you at all, but you need to start looking for solutions like that yourself. You could also play ith your pricing a little. Lower the price of your most pricey web design gig, but increase the price of your $10 gigs.
Maybe also re-evaluate your delivery times. No offense, but I don’t believe you can build me a full, fully responsive website in 2-days. Maybe create a 1-day consultation gig or package, and increase delivery time on your web design gig to something like 5-days.
Whatever you do, good luck. However, you really do need to start with you doing something, rather than asking for people to share their excess orders with you. Quite frankly, most people likely don’t have excess orders to start with.",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 4:21 pm",2020-07-29 18:04:43.061957

It doesn’t matter. Fiverr doesn’t allow sellers contacting buyers after order is done. It takes only one person not to like it and that’s it, best she will get a warning, worst he will loose her account.
In a real world it would’ve been an ok practice however it’s forbidden on fiver. If you want to risk your account - that’s fine, but do not advise others potentially harmful things.

Why are people keep giving this same bad advice while trying to present it as something other than spam? “Oh no, it’s not spam at all, it’s just bothering your recent clients like they can’t reorder a gig themselves if they need anything”.

I will advertise it on Google ads, Facebook & other social media channels. I don’t have enough budget right now but I can assure you that we will start this (Relief fund) even without any enough resources.

Greetings, you do not need to promote your site and post URL everywhere. talk about it, increase awareness of it and the need for such union. Anyone can build the website, but the whole point is not the traffic or number of members on the site but the act, will and sacrifice for other colleagues.

Secondly to operate like that you will need to register yourself with a government under a certain licence. Are you working on registering yourself as a charity? Otherwise your website will be nothing but a scam (even if you don’t think so). You can not register yourself as a sole trader otherwise you will have to pay tax on every donation you get as on normal income.

In all honesty, what credentials do you have to offer that would make people trust YOU to be the organizer for this “freelance union”? How do people who might be interested, know that you aren’t doing this for personal gain, or that there really are funds to be provided? Who are your big-name backers and financial supporters? What security and oversight do you have in mind? What kind of reputation are you building this upon? Have you procured legal standing? Do you have the paperwork that gives your “union” legitimacy?

This is the very nature of anyone choosing to be an independent worker. Independence from any corporate banner, and a self-minded approach to offering services is, by nature, supposed to be a risk freelancers take. Smart freelancers plan for tough times. They don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Freelancers are not unionized, or a cooperative venture. Freelancers take on the responsibility to be their own business – to grow their dreams, and become what they want to become. To be successful, means to take on the risk of failure as well. Without the risk of failure, there can be no success.
I admire those who truly wish to help freelancers, but I just don’t think you’re going about it in a reasonable, strategic or cooperative way. A union begins as a group of like-minded tradesmen, it isn’t one person trying to collect money for dubious distribution. I just don’t feel as though you are thinking this all the way through.

Our government wanted to spend $15 Mio for e-shop with freeways vignettes.
Web developers community said this amount is ridiculous and offered to make it for 10% of that money.
So they collected 40 specialists to develop and build up the site during weekend hackaton.
This group was so eager to show that they can do it in short time for friction of that money and finally they almost did it.
I say almost because just a few hours later after website was live, the site was broken with loss of personal data, cc data and more. Those were professionals but lack of time and proper planning meant failing.

Yes I have a small team & I’m also in contact with many professionals. I even sent many e-mails to different organizations who are working for Independent workers or Freelancers. I want their suggestions, advice & ideas. I’m just a normal person like you so yes I will face many challenges for sure.
Note: Freelancers Union is also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.
Some FAQs: (Let’s talk Legal)
So you will register this (Organization) as a Trade Union?
Maybe. Right now I’m just checking every single aspect because even the official (Freelancers Union) is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers). So they’re just a non-profit organization.
So you will register this as a Non-profit organization?
In my country, you can register a (Non-profit organization or NGO/NPO) in three ways. Trust Registration, Society Registration, Section 8 Company Registration (Earlier known as Section 25 Company)
The type of registration you will need depends on the purpose you want to achieve.
Please note that Society and Trust registration is different from business registration. This is because societies, trusts, and NGOS have charitable objectives. On the other hand, a business works only for profit. Therefore, separate laws govern Society and Trust registration. The only exception is a Section 8 company which is governed by the Companies Act, 2013. These entities receive some special tax exemptions and benefits. These benefits are not available to commercial business setups.
Do you have any business plan?
Yes I have a plan so I can achieve my goals. I’m doing my research right now so I can start this (UNION or Organization) so please make sure that If I start this UNION or NGO/NPO someday then I do have a business plan for it.
Do you have any legal team?
Yes I have a legal team so if I needed any kind of registration then I will contact them for sure. I will pay some huge amount for the registration. Also in case of emergencies the legal representative will help me.
Why Should I Trust You?
I’m just a normal freelancer like you. Recently I started this topic when my sales were dropped dramatically. Everything is normal now, But from that day I decided to do something for my community. Yes, Not just planning or thinking but to execute it properly. I don’t want to waste my time on such questions where people were asking me If I’m doing this for any personal gain. I want to help this community & the Freelancers. Specially the NON-US Freelancers. That’s why I’m planning it & I will execute it for sure.
Maybe not today, Next week or Next month but in next few years. So literally no one can stop me right now. I still remember a reply where someone told me that legal things take time so yeah I will wait until it’s done. I want an organization for (NON-US Freelancers) so I’ll try my best to be 100% legal. Otherwise I will not start this anytime soon.
Why you’re wasting your precious time on such Organization?
I just want to help this community, That’s all I want. Maybe someday we have a Union for NON-US Freelancers & I’m sure everyone wants it so we can help each other
What about funding?
Right now I will spend my own money because I want to start a small organization but yes when our (Organization) will get popular then we will find our supporters.

Things have definitely slowed down in comparison to the last few months and I can only assume it is because of the on-going global pandemic. Try not to stress too much and in the meantime, use this as an opportunity to strengthen and refine your existing brand/image on Fiverr or use it to build a brand new gig altogether.
There is always an opportunity to thrive during times like this but the challenge now is that you need to be extra creative and strategic about your branding, services, customer experience, etc. This is what’s going to set you apart from your competition when the volume of orders is at a low point.
A few key areas that I would personally focus on, if you haven’t already would be: Creating unique and engaging gig images or videos, writing clear and concise gig descriptions, and improving/adding to your existing skillset.
I hope this helps someone!
Best of luck to everyone and remember to be safe,

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

@wpfalcon
,
That’s a funny one you played on Fiverr customer support.
Anyways, even though I believe the Covid-19 posed a serious challenge to the US economy, I still believe their system is quite insulated to a reasonable extent. Most still use ■■■■■, teams, and the likes to further their engagements, hence their need for Fiverr digital services.
You may want to follow the advice of the Customer support, and perhaps, take a few tests to boost your competence in the face of customers.
I wish you all the best✌

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online.

As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

Perhaps not as strong a public relations opportunity.
Sorry, but these things frustrate me. We’re supposed to oooh and aahhh about this gesture, but it’s a deflection of the systemic issues within the platform.
I’m not saying Fiverr owes us anything because of Corona – not at all. I’m just saying that if they’re going to essentially brag about the good they’re doing for sellers, they should also address the unfairness that they’ve attached to the selling experience here – stuff we’ve been venting about here and elsewhere for literally years but nothing changes.
After all, the unjust elements of Fiverr affect sellers’ income from the platform the most and no amount of free resources is going to change that.",N/A,"Mar 16, 2020 10:34 pm",2020-07-29 18:07:15.481331

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

@mjensen415
,
Actually, there is something Fiverr could do to help its seller freelancer community in a direct and probably not too complicated way (a bit of coding and sending out automated emails, I think).
As it’s possible that some of us may have to apply for government funds or a mortgage respite, prove to their health insurance that they don’t earn much or at all due to this pandemic to not have to keep paying their monthly dues based on last year’s earnings/tax declaration, etc.,
a “paper” (email) from Fiverr stating the seller’s revenue for any given month could be more helpful and get less suspicious looks than that csv file one can download. Staff in such organisations often don’t know much if anything about freelancing or at least platforms like Fiverr/the gig economy, too, and often ask for “something official”.
Something that looks credible and official, with Fiverr’s address and such, that states something like:
XY is registered on our platform as a freelancer and earned $$$ revenue in (February 2020).
I’m sure Fiverr has people who can make sure that that “revenue statement” will be fine from a legal standpoint for Fiverr.
This has been already suggested before COVID-19, as something like that, especially as a yearly statement, would be really useful for tax and other purposes, but I think in the face of the current situation, it might just have become even more relevant.
I hope this can be considered/passed on to the relevant people. Thanks!",N/A,"Mar 20, 2020 12:39 pm",2020-07-29 18:07:25.871078

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 376. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

Self isolating, avoiding the outside world best I can. Stocked up pretty well but just carrying on with work here. My cat and I are quite comfortable.
The biggest “concern” I’ve had with my Fiverr orders right now is the prospect of cancellation requests popping up.
Money may have changed for some people / businesses. What was once a priority is perhaps not so much right now whilst this thing goes on.
I have this uncertainty about orders in my queue - Will I get a message from a customer out of no where asking to cancel because of their money woes or because the business side of things is on hold? Will I get several? Should I jump on the orders sooner rather than later or chill out a bit…
It creates a bit of unease for me, doubly so because of the way Fiverr handles cancellations now and obviously because income for a lot of freelancers is volatile currently (more than normal).
Not sure if others are feeling it.",N/A,"Mar 18, 2020 1:01 pm",2020-07-29 18:08:29.928604

What an interesting time we are in as a global economy. In my neck of the woods on the east coast beaches are closed, stores readily running out of supplies, business are shutting down everyday, police are breaking up beach parties, others getting on social media telling their friends to dine out.
Not much of a spread yet but a well know aerospace facility in my town just got a case of covid-19 and havent shut down. That facility employees hundreds of engineers. I live next door to an Airbnb for outatowners only. I don’t understand why people are traveling out of state/country right now. I’m afraid many are not taking this virus seriously.
In terms of Fiverr, it’s slowed down a bit but steady. I’m thankful we have the opportunity to work safely from home. THANK YOU Micha and the Fiverr team for building this place for us!!

East coast of the US. We have one death in the county I live in and over 100 cases state wide. Everything is shut down! Grocery stores are having a hard time keeping stock of disinfecting wipes and general cleaning supplies. They have Senior hours for people over 60 from 7-8am at the stores.
I am a Teacher by day, so off and trying to enjoy the time. No clue when and if we go back to work. Right now it is set for the end of the month to go back, but hard to see how with cases growing.
The biggest issue as I am sure the news has said is testing. It is so limited right now. To get tested requires so much effort, and as it becomes more available, I am sure the numbers will spike significantly.
Watching how different states handle this vs how the Govt is responding is interesting.
I do not want to go into that. I feel horrible for anyone affected by this. Seeing images. from Italy is scary, and I sure hope the US learns from China and Europes lessons and listens.

More seriously, I’d really like Fiverr to maybe go with
@eoinfinnegan
’s earlier suggestion of Fiverr relaxing St. Levels and maybe putting some UI tweaks in place to make sellers’ lives easier.
I’ve been bombed bya client repeatedly ordering in bulk from my single article gig with 1-day delivery, despite me asking him numerous times to message me before placing bulk orders. I’ve finally lost it and just canceled his last order. However, my stats will likely be ruined soon anyway.
The thing is, this wouldn’t happen if we had a feature to limit how many of a certain gig package a single buyer can buy at a time.
Another thing that would make life easier is a 24-hour or 48-hour auto-accept feature for disputes. I got bombed yesterday with lots of people who aren’t replying to extension requests, likely because it is the weekend and they are doing what normies do and are taking time out until Monday.
And would it really be so hard to darken and increase the font size of the fonts in messages, order requirements, and custom offers? - Or let sellers customize this?",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 5:53 pm",2020-07-29 18:08:59.580015

This! Even a 3/4 day long or something would be better than the current Buyers can just disappear situation. I have a $550 order with a client who has disappeared for two weeks after we had extended the delivery a couple of times (order placed over 2 months ago) while waiting for them for other reasons. There is still some parts of the order to complete which she has said she wants to give input to but hasn’t done so meaning I can’t just push ahead with it.
Meanwhile, it looks like I have an order which is 16 days late and technically the client could cancel it and get refunded at any point as I can’t do an extension without her agreement…",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 8:18 pm",2020-07-29 18:09:00.706693

I come from Italy. As you may have already heard, here the situation is truly tragic, especially in Northern Italy. We’ve been in quarantine for 13 days, all non-essential services are closed, and the military and police officers monitor the cities. Many have lost their jobs and self-employed workers are the ones who are suffering a severe blow, economically speaking. Fortunately, I am doing fine. The company I work for allows smart-working and when I don’t work, I have online lessons and dedicate myself to freelancing ( well, and Netflix too). I’ve noticed that several other companies are demanding for people to work remotely. I imagine that in this tragic scenario the world of work gets adapted to the circumstances and I think this is positive for those who now find it difficult to raise some money.
Either way, I hope you are all fine. Wherever you come from, try to stay safe!",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 8:48 pm",2020-07-29 18:09:01.512949

This is getting ridiculous if I’m honest.
On my island, we have had no cases but 1 that was sent to the mainland. The only way to get here is by ferry. All businesses are closed and already people are losing their jobs and can’t pay their bills. It would be easy to prohibit passengers on the ferry and just use the service for goods. This way, life here could continue as something like normal and small businesses would at least stand a chance.
Instead, tourists can get a 10,000 euro fine for not answering the door when a policeman calls to see if they are obeying by quarantine rules. (This means they press buzzers on apartment main entrances that usually don’t work, and guess what time they call?) Businesses can also get a 3,000 fine for opening and at least one has already been fined for trying to do something productive and having staff on-site doing paintwork and maintenance.
It is all madness.
And if you thought Coronavirus was bad, wait for rat flu!
Mail Online – 24 Mar 20
Man who died on bus in China tests positive for virus RATS spread
The victim died on a vehicle in Shandong as he made his way to work and was found to be suffering from hantavirus, which infected rats spread through bites, droppings, urine and saliva.
Then you have that minor problem that is when economies nosedive, public health goes through the floor. Infant mortality rates go up, life expectancy shortens, violent crime goes up, the rate of people choosing to end it all skyrockets, rates of malnutrition go up, disease spreads more easily as a result, homelessness rates skyrocket…

I can’t imagine what our pitiful little local emergency waiting room must be like, parents with screaming babies waiting for hours, homeless people, all sick and coughing, overworked understaffed nurses. Hope I don’t have to find out, in person.
A small ray of hope:
They found the virus doesn’t like hot humid weather, over 63 degrees f. It slows it down.
They also found it does not mutate due to the way it’s put together, unlike the flu, so any vaccine will likely be permanent.
Best hope: a year from now a good vaccine will be available to anyone. And the drug that shows so much promise is widely available to anyone who needs it.

Continuing with odd jobs and writing on my end.

And now I see how many people willing to help and take care about others and keep the rules. This is war and we are fighting with unseen enemy with whole world together this is very unique times we are leaving when you can win the enemy just doing nothing staying at home and keeping all the sanitarian rules when you need to go out. Covid-19 if we can take a look from the other side make us stronger and united we are all human beings no matter where you leave and what is your color we are all humans and this is a good time to stay at home and think about what we do wrong and why we do this with our earth and how we can change. Believe me we can if we stay united there is no need for any disease to make us take care more about our earth I hope this period of time will teach us to be more sensitive about what we do and if everything we are doing is good and brings happiness to others be more kind and compassive to others and nature. Don’t wait just do it make the world better today. I study how to make a medical masks from youtube and make 10-15 masks everyday and after share with old people for free also I try to help my neighbors who leave alone and higher than 60 to keep them stay home. I buy products and leave in the front of doors disinfecting with an alcohol the plastic bags first. I have no time to watch movies and read books which I love I just spend my time designing my route and planing the deliveries. Also you can help with donations https://blog.fiverr.com/freelancers-relief-fund/ 2 if you can help without contacting with others do it even a small help can turn to the big one if we unite,N/A,"Mar 26, 2020 7:26 pm",2020-07-29 18:09:15.044971

We have no working plumbing currently in our ancient house and I’m afraid to let in anyone to fix it since our area is a very high covid area and I don’t want to be around any strangers.
Yesterday we had a complete blackout for a while. Between no plumbing and no lights or electricity it was surreal. At least in a cave we could build a fire and use the outside “restroom”.
I found myself yelling out the front door to the neighbors to find out what was happening with the electricity. We aren’t supposed to go outside at all here. I felt like a trapped animal.
Lena I hope that they are at least working at putting out that fire! You sound like you are in a bad situation there.

Last night, instead of attending a concert in Memphis to see Motionless in White, I was at home. The concert was postponed (understandable) and who knows if the concert will even happen. The bright spot of the whole thing is that my school will remain shut down for the rest of the academic year. Now, I do need to go in once a week to get things done such as auditing for next year and payments.
As it stands now, my job is being terminated due to restructuring. I was actually called to ask if I wanted another position in the school as a parapro. While it’s not what I want all the way around, I know I can do the job and will do it as I do anything else in my life. I await the final decision from the board to see if they will make the approval. So, we’ll see!
Thankfully, the Fiverr work has increased, which may be due in part to finding my best gig on page one again with the culmination of an ad I ran.
In the grand scheme of things, I’m just playing the wait and see game and doing work when it comes in.

Since I do reports all the time at work I find it natural to make a report on what I did during quarantine since this is the last Q-day in my country (Croatia). Starting tomorrow business should be slowly returning to normal.
So:
I published 2 new books
I wrote 3 new books and prepared drafts for 12 more
I wrote 5 e-books for students struggling to learn online since schools are closed
I started Fiverr seller account and earned 92 USD
I designed furniture for my backyard and build it together with my crafty neighbor
I repurposed frame of the old trampoline into the gym area
I planted some flowers for the first time in my life
I draw a big “NO SMOKING” sign in my backyard
I started a YouTube channel and helped a kid who was being harassed by others on the live stream
And
I cleaned and organized my office (this lasted for one day and now it is back to random mess)
I discovered there is nothing wrong with my car battery, for some reason car wants to start only if the shift gear is in a certain position
I gain 10 pounds (and then I decided to make gym outside :D)
I actually planted seeds of watermelon next to flowers.

Thank you for the Mexico part. I wish. Then I would know Spanish, my dream language.
I feel sorry for my old self. I had this backyard for 39 years and my day was wake up, go to university, do lectures for 8 hours, then do e-learning for 6 hours, and go to sleep, tomorrow, repeat. Never break, never rest, and the worst part is - nothing, I have nothing from 14 years of that, I worked to buy food and pay bills, the moment I save some money the prices go 30% up. Over and over. All the years of life wasted. I never wanted to invest in the apartment and backyard since it is rented, not mine. I finally got to my senses I need to enjoy in today.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/0/4/e/04e4b0779d0e9a6b38c26c5f727920ee25e3d16d.jpeg,"May 16, 2020 2:53 am",2020-07-29 18:10:27.915738

I’m sorry for your sisters situation. However, she might be lucky if France is still treating oncology patients. In Malta and lots of other countries, most cancer screening and treatment is pretty much on hold at the moment. I have a friend with lung cancer who hasn’t been to the hospital in weeks.

COVID19 is not so dangerous as cancer.
More people have died in building accidents on Malta this year than they have of COVID. However, the constriction industry is the only industry that has been allowed to continue operating as normal throughout the pandemic. Apparently, the cost to the economy would be to great if they ceased operations.
Then you have the suicide rate in the U.S. In some states, they have already recorded more suicides this year than during the entirety on 2019. Sadly, most people aren’t interested in looking at the bigger picture.

However, I can say with certainty that there is a drastically increased level of competition on Fiverr, as a result of the global pandemic. More sellers, means existing sellers tend to see lower metrics from the search results. Perhaps there are too many people trying to sell services for your keywords, and your services aren’t being seen as much.
It’s also worth noting that, people just might not be searching for your services as much. The world is changing – even moreso because of Covid. Perhaps there isn’t as much demand for your services now, compared to in the past.

@mariashtelle1
is correct… most stores may be out of liquid hand sanitizers, but I’ve been seeing plenty of bar soaps. Those are just as good as liquid hand soap. Heck, dish soap should work too – I wash my hands in our kitchen sink with dish soap all the time.
The point is to wash your hands with soap and water. Soap comes in many formats.
If you can’t find medical face masks, use a bandana or a scarf. The point is to stop YOURSELF from potentially spreading the virus. Medical professionals have been saying that, if necessary, bandanas and scarfs are better than nothing.

By Monday the delivery option just magically disappeared from every major grocery store’s website.

You can make your own masks- there are plenty of tutorials on youtube for those with or without sewing machines. It’s easy … but a bit fiddly.
That and clothing brands started selling washable masks.

Don’t believe everything you read. That article sounds just as a click bait and not like a reliable source. I wouldn’t google to prove if it’s right or wrong but I will give you a couple of question for some critical thinking:
All countries has contracts set up in place on the amount of export and import. Usually they have few chains of suppliers coming from different countries to sustain flow of products in case if there is a political/economical problem with one of the suppliers. That means that they need to honor their deals and they can not just say that let’s say Australia wouldn’t get their groceries (or whatever else) just because China decided to buy it. Everyone has contractual obligations.
However supply chains are indeed suffering right now because this products have never been in such a demand and there was a certain amount of stock produced. When everything suddenly got sold out it still takes tome to produce it. And now it’s not only to produce it but also increase the capacity of your factories to produce higher amount of stock. Which takes time. And we are in the situation where a lot of factories have been stopped not even talking about increasing their production.
I’m sure China is buying a lot but they are also sending a lot of help including physical goods to other countries that need more help.
So I totally wouldn’t take seriously that article. Or I would’ve done the research to confirm that info.",N/A,"Apr 6, 2020 5:43 am",2020-07-29 18:12:09.825520

Is Corona Virus Pandemic really directly or indirectly affecting Orders?
There are many reasons why your sales levels could rise or fall. Let’s not get into the habit of conveniently blaming the Covid pandemic for everything. I’ve been seeing a lot of sellers doing this lately. Perhaps your competitors are doing a better job winning over your potential clients. Maybe there just isn’t as much demand for your services, or perhaps your service offering has grown a bit stale, and needs to be updated. Maybe your gig has entered rotation in the search results, and isn’t being seen by as many people as before. Are you doing any self-marketing? Are you doing anything on your own to connect to your target customers?
If things aren’t going as well as they once were, perhaps there are things that YOU can do to turn things back around. Trying to find something else to blame for the low sales isn’t a productive way to improve your success.",N/A,"Jul 3, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-07-29 18:12:21.353827

They found all contacts of sick people (which are more than 2000 people that they found and quarantined as a prevention even without symptoms), closed borders (which a lot of people doesn’t like), made it a CRIMINAL offence to withhold information about your whereabouts and your health condition. Your visas will be revoked and you will be deported from the country if you breached home quarantine. Government will pay all your medical bills if you get sick and if you are in official quarantine you will be compensated 100$ for each day.
But there is no point to panic because of this and just to take normal precautions which should’ve been common sense by now, not to sneeze and cough with open mouth, do not spit on the streets, wash your hands and don’t touch your face. Seriously it’s all common sense and governments shouldn’t be telling us to follow this rules.
We still have more chances to be hit by a car.
But industries will be affected in short and long run.",N/A,"Feb 27, 2020 9:42 pm",2020-07-29 18:12:57.201808

However it does make sense to make it a criminal offence if you look from a different angle: in South Korea there is an old aunty that got sick a lot of people going to church and buffets every day, she knew she had symptoms, she visited a doctor and doctor explicitly asked her to make a test because he suspect a virus, she refused. And even after she knew that she might have virus she still went to church and drunk from the same cup with everyone else.

Not entirely correct. Depending on the mask. An N95 disposable mask (or P2 / P3 for European equivilant) do offer a form of protection, but health officials are cautious to recommend them because most people won’t use them properly (fitted flush to the face properly at each use) and they’re not designed for more than short term use. They’re also a little expensive.
A regular surgical mask does give some degree but the main reason is that is helps protect people when touching their face/mouth (which they do some 23-40 times an hour) - Wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission, if nominally, as long as you’re practicing good hand hygeine as well.
As you rightly said, The other benefit is that they also help reduce a person who is infected spreading it further theoretically.

But is this year a caution for me? Why?
Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))! Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos. Though other photo types are going well.

This is something unlike anything before it. Things have changed. Hopefully a vaccine will come along for it soon.
Expect to see people wearing masks in public, restaurants closing and who knows what else, on a permanent basis. We all are fortunate who work from home.
Notice that a cruise ship was a place where many caught it. Being in an enclosed area with others is to be avoided if possible. Public transport for example might see a decline. Starbucks stock may take a hit for example. Think of any place where you are around lots of other people.
And apparently people can have it without symptoms and give it to others. How much will people’s way of life be changed?

Even mandatory testing of owners before it can be sold, like they do with termites in some areas. Or even simply home shopping. That could be hazardous.

Do we have any information about what caused COVID-19?

Yes eating bats in a certain Asian country. Apparently they have the virus and it was able to transfer to people.
Bats are one theory, and not an overly realistic one, if you’re following the details of current events (as well as the constantly-changing propaganda coming out of a certain Asian country). Other people seem to present a rather strong case for a more intentional source of the virus – developed in a lab (in the same city the virus was first reported in), and accidentally released into the population.
The fact that the certain Asian country is now trying to blame the USA military as the source of the virus also tends to lend support for the second source story – the laboratory source.
Until that certain Asian nation actually releases factual data, however, no one will know for certain where, and how the virus actually got its start.",N/A,"Mar 13, 2020 11:37 pm",2020-07-29 18:13:33.986729

I bet that cancellation will hurt your order completion rate.
My stats are all 100% but then there are all kinds of invisible metrics we don’t know about.
The entire situation opens endless possibilities for buyers to demand refunds over actual or pretend event cancellations, though. But this is something I’d rather not think about.
If I get any more orders for event promos, I’ll probably be putting together a short disclaimer to please keep checking if an event is still a go and that no refund will be possible if the event is canceled after the delivery. Then watch me get reported for being greedy and heartless in the face of a pandemic
Revenue-wise, I’m one order away from 50% of my monthly income but my inbox is completely dead since Thursday (minus a few orders that were previously agreed upon).

Regular",5,"Throwing in my two cents: Correlation ≠ causation. It’s not the virus itself, it’s the the consequences of fear caused by the virus.
This actually boosts certain types of industries, such as suppliers of emergency goods, while it affects others negatively because consumers are diverting their available funds to those goods, from things of lesser relative importance.
One of my favorite quotes:
Just because you see a turkey flying in a tornado doesn’t mean turkeys can fly.
In other words: just because you’re doing well when there’s a good economy, doesn’t mean you’ll keep doing well if what you offer isn’t a critical-to-survival good/service. I’ll admit I’m exaggerating, but the point stands; people are going to prioritize. This was witnessed during the American Great Depression, and is witnessed any time a noticeable recession occurs in any established economy. Nowadays, being global and digital only means the effects are even more noticed by those who rely on being a global economy like many on Fiverr.
Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.
Many people seem confused by this event, but it’s not a new phenomena. (Remember the H1N1?) Yes, there will be victims (the flu still has more deaths-per-year, thus far). Yes, this is something to be attentive to (though you’d have to be rather socially-starved to be completely out-of-the-loop). Yes, it’s cause to take a few extra steps to be a bit more safe (if an individual isn’t already practicing good hygiene). But this IS. NOT. NEW.
The cancellation of events are for the sake of protecting people from themselves, because people will rationalize that going to a massive gathering is more important than their health AND the health of the people around them. (Like some people rationalize that answering a text is more important than focusing on the road. It doesn’t matter how often ‘nothing’ happens, it only takes one time for disaster to occur.)
I should probably get off the soapbox, though. Not sure how I ended up on it, actually. I was only going to make a short comment.",N/A,"Mar 14, 2020 12:35 pm",2020-07-29 18:13:41.027294

Fiverr puts too much pressure on the sellers. We’re supposed to deliver perfect work, 100% of the time. If the client is not happy, we’re supposed to work with the client until happiness is achieved. It’s all subjective, and we’re not protected.
On Uber, if you show up to a location and the passenger doesn’t show up, you can cancel and collect $3.90. If you pick up the passenger and deliver him, you’re gonna get paid even if he gives you 1 star. You can also get your money right away if you don’t mind paying a 50 cent fee. Or send it to Uber’s debit card without the fee.

Whenever something disrupts the global and regional markets, and there are closures, there is bound to be a decline. Keep in mind, many work has totally suspended or got cancelled, so demand is obviously going to get lower as well. Just because people are locked up inside their homes doesn’t mean they’ll order more online.
People actually need to go to work and have projects in order to give us work so this will definitely affect us freelancers and it might get worse as more strict protocols and longer shutdowns are in place.

I’m curious how much money (per mile) do Uber/Lyft drivers make today? I use to keep up with a few drivers on YT but it’s been a longtime.
What Uber pays per mile depends on where you are in the USA or in the world. In South Florida, we get $0.62 per mile, $0.12 per minute. I think taxi drivers make $1.25 per mile, $0.25 per minute. Uber drivers make more when they drive luxury vehicles, huge minivans, etc. If there are no surges (extra money for increased demand), I will filter towards long rides, and reject short rides (as long as Uber lets me, they can disable that function if you reject too many rides). If there is a surge, I will drive towards it (if it’s close) and go online and accept the first ride I get.
A fellow driver tells me his goal is making $100 in 5 hours. Sometimes that’s possible, other time it’s not. On average, I make $12 to $15 an hour. It’s a job that requires patience because the first hour might be horrible, but on the next hour you might get great surges.",N/A,"Mar 16, 2020 2:30 am",2020-07-29 18:13:59.066079

The economy as a whole of course takes a massive hit but people still spend money, just not as much and partly on different things, and more on certain things.
There will be demand for new things/services or more of some already existing things/services, while the world tries to adapt and keep functioning.
Whether someone has work or not, now highly depends on what exactly one does, and if there are alternatives. Here , for example, people who work in restaurants which are empty or closed, are being suggested they could work in farming, as the workers from abroad will be missing, when borders are and stay closed for a while.

Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos. Though other photo types are going well.

After the 2008 financial crisis, this happened in Greece with massive self-death increases (can’t say the S word), and spikes in bygone diseases like Malaria:
Malaria has returned to Greece as financial cuts contribute to the re-emergence of a once extinct disease. … Other mosquito-borne diseases that have slipped back into Greece include West Nile virus. Statistics show that there were 70 instances of mosquito borne diseases in Greece in the first nine months of the year.

We do not have “public health care” here, or anything close to it. We have public “who cares?”
Yup! I’m one of the few who is covered on all fronts, Medical, Dental, and Vision. Other people not so much. It’s definitely not cheap. ACA is available as well as Medicare/Medicaid. There are a group of people who simply cannot afford to pay these high premiums.

Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))!

I’m 23 and I am Quarantining. It’s not an over reaction.
People your age are unlikely to catch covid. Also, most people aren’t self-isolating, Home Depot and local supermarkets have been as busy as ever. In fact, I think some folks are using this opportunity to work on construction projects, gardening, etc.
blavaro:
Furthermore self-quarantine is mainly supposed to stop spreading the infection.
We’ll see if it works. I know kids on Spring Break have been going to the beach even though the governor of Florida closed the beaches. How do you enforce that? Do you put a cop on every beach? It’s very impractical. In California, they expect people to snitch on lawbreakers, good luck with that. Most people mind their own business unless a crime is commited against them.
Besides, how long do you think people can live like this? Who wants to live a life without restaurants, movie theaters, etc? Who wants to cook every meal at home and overpay for toilet paper on eBay?
People talk about the sacrifices civilians made during WW2, but that was different, and those civilians still had access to movies and other entertainments. It was gas that was rationed, people grew victory gardens, and lived with a lot less. Ironically, there was still a black market, people selling counterfeit gas cards, etc.
Now things are pretty crazy. I read that in New Jersey a family got arrested for inviting more than 50 people to a wedding at home.
On the other hand, in Philadelphia they are delaying arrests of those who “commit certain non-violent offenses.” So if someone wants to burglarize homes in Philly, this is the perfect time to do it.
“Due to the confirmed case of #COVID19 from community spread, Salt Lake City Police Department is asking all criminal activities/nefarious behavior to cease until further notice,” the Utah capital’s law enforcement wrote in a tweet. “We appreciate your anticipated cooperation in halting crime & thank criminals in advance.”

Similarly US had about 40 odd cases a few days ago and now US has more than 22K cases.
This is because the USA is actively and widely testing. There may have been only 40 KNOWN cases, but that doesn’t mean there couldn’t have already been many more at that time.
22,000 cases seems like a large number, however, in a nation of 330 million people, that’s only 0.00006% of the total population, and most of those infected right now have minor/moderate cases that do not require hospitalization.

One fifth of our entire country may need to be hospitalized.
fastcopywriter:
Is it fair to shut down society for the one fifth that are in danger?
It sounds like you can’t grasp the gravity of the situation.
No one has immunity to this disease and it’s impossible to determine who will be able to throw it off like a case of the flu, and who will become more sick.
We now have a U.S. senator who tested positive, and a governor as I recall. Look at what happened to Italy. We unfortunately can expect that here, no reason to believe otherwise. By shutting things down we might be able to “flatten the curve” meaning not have as high a spike before cases start to go down. It’s our best hope.
So far we are a long way from the time when cases will start to go down. I wish everyone could realize the importance of at least keeping a distance between themselves and others, and frequent hand washing.
It’s not just about each of us trying to not get sick. It’s about having it without any symptoms, and going around where others are and spreading it to them. So even if you don’t have symptoms you may put others into danger by coming into close proximity to them. This is a common way people get it.
I want to offer a bit of hope as well as this gloomy report:

And yet Italy is denying respirators to people over 60. See? Human life has a price, and when the government controls your healthcare, they decide who lives and who dies, who’s valuable and who has been alive too long for them to care.

No one has immunity to this disease and it’s impossible to determine who will be able to throw it off like a case of the flu, and who will become more sick.
My point is not everyone is susceptible to this disease, not everyone catches it. Right now Home Depot (and other retailers I assume) instituted a rule where the store can’t have more than 100 people inside, including employees. So you can imagine the long lines of people waiting to get in. Ironically, there’s not much social isolation when you’re standing in line, so the measures are futile.
I do hope remdesivir works, I can’t wait to go back to normal. I hope we never again shut down society over a disease.
blavaro:
It is pity that in our country people still think so selfish these days.
Selfishness is the natural state of people. Altruism and self-sacrifice are aberrations. When someone orders for me, it’s for selfish reasons, same reason I serve my customers well. Altruism would require me to refund every order and tell my client, “I love you so much, that I want to work for you for free.” That I’ll never do, I might give my clients extras to keep him coming back, see? Selfish reasons, but I wont’ sacrifice my time and my money for anyone. If anyone gets a refund, that person is blocked and reported to Fiverr.

Staying 2 meters away from people is unrealistic.
In some cases (as when working in Home Depot, I suppose), definitely. That’s where masks and gloves come in.

That’s not right. That’s like waiting two years for a kidney, undergoing dialysis three times a week, and when a kidney is finally available, they give it to a celebrity.
If I show up to the hospital first, I’m supposed to be treated first. What kind of sickos choose who gets to live and who gets to die? If someone dies because all respirators were taken, that’s sad, but at least that person didn’t die because someone deemed him or her unworthy.
Older people are worthy. They have families, they’ve paid taxes their entire lives, some of them fought in WW2, they should be honored instead of being sentenced to death by giving that respirator to another patient.

Companies should embrace remote work permanently.
When they do that, they might as well embrace hiring freelancers instead of employees. Then it will become a case of companies constantly looking to reduce wage bills by hiring offshore workers.
Then there is the cybersecurity side of things. Then there is the slight problem that when you work from home you degenerate into an overweight blob that lives in less and less underwear every day and panics every time the doorbell rings…
Personally, I’ve regretted freelancing for quite a few years now, as I miss the sociability side of things.

Nor did we really know how it would affect the rest of the world or Gig economy workers. Sitting here on March 25th, Sh&T got real! More than 1/3 of the US population is under stay at home orders. It does not mean that everyone is listening. NY is the epicenter of this in the US for now, cases and deaths are rising at record rates each day countrywide - but mainly NY. A sign of things to come in other states is what many seem to wonder. We are still, although better at testing, need more tests to get a read on the entire picture and testing is backlogged, so I do not believe we have the full picture of how this is spreading in places outside of the major epicenters here.
The daily briefings by Governers, especially Cuomo of NY, and that of our commander in Chief are fascinating and taking the place of sporting events I would be watching for entertainment. I will leave that alone for now.
Good news for self-employed Gig workers who are affected by this. Sounds. like they can file for unemployment and get that plus some via this new bailout bill from congress.
The school system I work in just announced closure for 4 more weeks with remote learning. It should be interesting to see how they implement that.
Amazing how things change in just one short month. It went from we are scared and watching and maybe it won’t be so bad to oh Sh&t!

Thanks for the heads up on gig worker unemployment benefits:
Gig workers, freelancers, self-employed are eligible
In an unprecedented move, the stimulus bill expands unemployment protections to gig workers, freelancers and self-employed individuals, who typically don’t qualify for unemployment benefits.
Seth Harris, former Deputy U.S. Secretary of Labor, describes this aspect of the stimulus package as a “gigantic change,” but notes that it could be complicated to execute.
“It will be harder [to calculate] because these workers don’t have a W-2 or an average weekly wage,” Harris says. “These folks have income that varies dramatically from week to week or month to month.”
It’s not clear yet how state benefits will be calculated for these workers (from forbes)",N/A,"Mar 25, 2020 7:29 pm",2020-07-29 18:14:45.943383

I was lucky enough to get a remote appointment with my doctor tomorrow.
I wish you the best of luck, but I’m pretty sure they’re gonna take your blood pressure and temperature themselves, they always do that, they’ll probably wear gloves, masks, and glasses.
cyaxrex:
When they do that, they might as well embrace hiring freelancers instead of employees. Then it will become a case of companies constantly looking to reduce wage bills by hiring offshore workers.
It depends on the job, if you get paid to talk to people on social media, they’re going to need you everyday. I once interviewed for a company that does that, for several brands, but my typing speed wasn’t good enough for some reason. Maybe I’m lucky, that office smelled really bad, like mold or dirty AC.
cyaxrex:
Then there is the slight problem that when you work from home you degenerate into an overweight blob that lives in less and less underwear every day and panics every time the doorbell rings…
I think that’s a stereotype. Fitness fanatics will join gyms, job, lift weights, etc. Sedentary people will gain weight at home or in the office.

Only once three or four weeks ago, I lost track of time since the quarantine began. I don’t think he would have gotten better on his own, the reason he’s in the hospital is because his fever and breathing got a lot worse, and he was feeling really bad. He’s 67, so he’s definitely part of the main demographic for corona.

Many people are drowning in the routine of everyday life. Sleep, eat, go to work, watch a movie and sleep again. Now there is time to develop your skills. Time to give life to your ideas.
Therefore, I urge everyone not to lose heart. And start doing things and projects for which you did not have time. Now nothing distracts you. You can completely immerse yourself in creativity.

I myself had every intention of going to the gym today but the more the day dragged on, the less I felt up to it. In fact, my sinuses are driving me nuts and my eyes are itchy. I’m pretty sure my allergies are starting to flare up. I’m not really self-isolating but really just staying to myself. Luckily, I can really rest because I have no work to speak of anymore. I had a large order come in yesterday and it’s already done and sent off to the client.
For now, the rest of the day is mine. Thanks to this virus, the school shut down for a week before spring break (by orders of the governor). I had to go in for a short time to get billing done, but other than that, the day is my own
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.

Hope it’s not COVID-19, and something else entirely. Here’s hoping, either way, that you get to feeling better soon.
I’m not too worried about my personal health because if it is COVID-19, at least now I know that it won’t kill me or make me extremely unwell. It honestly feels like that annoying bronchitis that comes after tonsilitis. Irritating and I feel a little rough, but not any worse than a cold. I do however worry about the people I came into contact with before I started presenting symptoms.
emeraldawnn:
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.
Honestly, if it weren’t a worldwide pandemic out there, this almost sounds like an idyllic day. Glad things don’t seem to be too stressful in your family. Get to work on those puzzles!!
graphtersawyer:
I’m absolutely terrified of being sick with anything, so this whole thing has really just made my anxiety skyrocket.
I’m so sorry friend. I’ll be thinking about you and your family. Extremely frustrating when people don’t seem to realize that the spread is totally preventable if we just do the right things
I have OCD (the actual kind) but luckily not related to germs/infection, otherwise I’m sure this would’ve destroyed my mental health. I have a good friend with a dibilitating fear of germs and she is having a really rough time
graphtersawyer:
Does being sick affect your ability to do VO work at all?
Thank god, no. The cough I have is very “chesty” - not mucusy/productive. It feels like my lungs are contracting every 15-20 seconds or so and I have to cough. But I haven’t got a sore throat yet so I can keep churning out work!
lenasemenkova:
No cough, though.
Many people don’t develop a cough. Some people just have a fever, and some people have just the cough. NHS advises anyone with either OR both to self-isolate. Here’s hoping you’ve already had it and now you’re not at risk anymore!! <3",N/A,"Mar 17, 2020 1:21 pm",2020-07-29 18:15:24.555212

Some hot humid weather might help this in the summer with any luck.
To be fair, I’m more concerned about my country collapsing on itself than the dang virus. There are very questionable political decisions being made that have nothing to do with the virus but will without a doubt provoke a strong public response (i.e., massive protests). I.e., huge public gatherings in the middle of the pandemic. I had a good long ugly cry about it this morning.

@gwyneth_galvin
- sorry to hear this. But glad - in a kinda sardonic way - you’re getting it out of the way early.
My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
Here in Glasgow you cannot get paper goods for love nor money. Soap is in very short supply … but not shampoo for some reason. Shelves and shelves of shampoo and conditioner with no one interested in it. At a pinch, you can use that as shower gel and washing up liquid - it all has the same base, apparently.
Luckily, we’d put some stuff aside for Brexit, which we still have … or at least what’s left of it after Brexit didn’t really happen that much.
And yes, that EFT tapping for increasing lung capacity is a great idea. EFT for anything is a good idea. I have a tapping round for making sure your system is open to accepting everything you do for yourself, which is really useful.
@graphtersawyer
- take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.

I contracted the H1N1 virus years back and was quarantined in hospital for several days…definitely don’t want to go through that again.
Guess what else we have in common?
I lived in a massive student dorm during the h1n1 outbreak and it crept down our hall one room at a time over the course of a couple weeks. I was the last person to catch it in our dorm. I’ve never been so ill in all my life. [Insert graphic details too gross for the fiverr forum]

My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
How lucky is he to have a parent like you there! He must be so grateful to have you nearby. I miss my mum

Everything is sold out here too.

Thats a very positive step from you and the right thing to do. If, god forbids, you develop a fever than you must go to the hospital.

I am isolating myself as well, even though I don’t have symptoms, and only going out for groceries with mask and gloves. Its the least we can do.

Even though they are less likely to get sick, they can spread it. Until we have a full picture of how bad or not bad it is, we can not make rational decisions. Right now it is preparing for worse case scenarios. We have no real data from tests. We need testing. No real guidance from the Government. State leaders are figuring things out on their own. Where I live they are turning DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) stations into testing centers. We are about 7 weeks past our first case in the US, and we are just getting testing going. Nuts.
Will everyone get tested if it is free? Non citizens? Will they risk going to the hospital and getting deported? Just my personal thoughts. Frustrating to watch it unfold in slow motion.

I would question that information. Singapore closed their borders completely a long time ago.
They don’t even let in some people who stick outside and residing in Singapore and suddenly they will allow people from Your country to fly here with covid already? Nah, I highly doubt that.

The metrics are still being accrued, they just aren’t being displayed. Gigs have not stopped gaining impressions just because the impressions are not being displayed.
Do you really believe the analytics data is stored correctly everywhere in Fiverr’s databases etc. (eg.in all relevant tables) and that it just can’t show those values?
Don’t you think the analytics page just basically took values that were already stored somewhere (like in fields in a particular table or that could easily be calculated from them) and then displayed them (eg. in the graph/as values)?
It’s not really a “display issue” if it’s wrong in one or more places in the database. The analytics page wouldn’t read through lots of data to show one value to the user as it wouldn’t be efficient.
Why would it take multiple weeks to show a value that is already stored correctly when the code for showing that data in the graph hasn’t really changed? Where’s the difficulty in showing a value that is already stored correctly using the method they already had? And if it was correct everywhere in the database, why was it only recent days’ values that started being shown as 0 when the previous days were being shown correctly (before they changed everything to show “N/A”).
It’s obviously stored wrong somewhere (if stored at all in that place) in the database and that was what was getting displayed before they changed it to show “N/A”. And they’re obviously trying to fix the values somewhere in the database (even if it’s right somewhere else) or get it to start writing the values correctly somewhere in the database for a seller’s analytics figures (eg. daily/weekly/monthly totals).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-07-29 18:17:04.830824

Daily & weekly or monthly impressions? I’m not sure they can - at least without totalling them in the way (or similar to) they’re trying to get the system to do automatically.
And yes the numbers (such as daily/weekly/monthly totals) for things like clicks or conversions might get used by the algorithms(s) used by the search engine. And if some of them are wrong (incorrectly totalled for some, no values or zero values for others), then it could potentially affect the Fiverr search engine results.

I don’t think Fiverr is giving a full enough version of what is actually happening by saying what they have. They’re saying it’s a “display issue” just so it doesn’t seem that big of an issue - but it’s taken weeks to try and fix and the last post in the “N/A” thread says it will still be a few more weeks. Values might be getting stored in one place but not in the place needed by the gigs screen - it’s not stored correctly in the place in the database that that gigs screen reads (eg. the totals - and that could effect other things like the search engine if that also reads those totals).
It’s obviously not just a “display issue”. It must be stored incorrectly somewhere for it to have shown it incorrectly like they did. Like I said, it would be too inefficient for it to be reading lots of records before showing the monthly/weekly/daily totals for each gig (in the “gigs” page) so it’s very unlikely to be doing that (it would have to keep re-reading all those tons of records each time you reloaded the page) - instead it will have been using stored values - and they will have recently (before the “N/A” change) been incorrect (or not set).
Fiverr haven’t said what exactly has caused this or whether those values/totals for clicks/views etc. for gigs are correct in every place in the database(s) or anywhere else they’re stored - or explained why a piece of code that was displaying the values suddenly stopped working (what changed apart from the stored data that was used by that code?).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-07-29 18:17:06.764280

They have told us what we need to know. Nothing is stopping any seller from earning sales. And, as is often said on this forum, earning sales is an issue of seller self-responsibility, not waiting around for Fiverr to provide sales. We know what we need to know. Fiverr – or any Fiverr display error – is not keeping anyone from being responsible and earning their success.

So since Fiverr haven’t given us a full enough story about what has happened and whether the data is correct in every place in the database(s) etc. we can’t really continue saying that it’s being stored correctly (at least not everywhere).
If it was being stored correctly everywhere, how long really would it take to display that value on screen?

Yes but Fiverr should really be open enough about the issue, especially if people are going to repeat what they say as though all values are correctly stored everywhere (which, if that was true, it would surely be easy to display it).

It’s very possible that your gig will go “down” after you come back, but then again, I’ve been out of office many times and my account wasn’t affected. It’s a matter of luck, I guess, but your health and mental health are more important.

I fear nobody can tell you how bad the hit for your ranking might be; some people post that they experience long slump periods after breaks, others say it picks up again soon for them. Chances are that your gig will be de-ranked, as Fiverr wants to show buyers active gigs, obviously, (or even because of normal gig rotation), so I think it’s unprobable that you would continue from the same position if your gig is inactive for two weeks or longer, but how bad it will be/how long it will take to rank higher again, your guess is as good as anybody else’s.
However, half of June is over already, and as you say it was your best month yet, and it’s just two weeks until end of June, and money is the last thing you care for, maybe just do it and take care of your family and yourself those two weeks, especially if a family member is in critical condition, but that’s something you have to decide for yourself.
In any case, though, if you feel you’re having a mental breakdown, press pause ASAP.

I saw somewhere that Micha Kaufman (sp?) say the overall bottom line has increased on 5r since the C-19.
Apparently, with people working from home, they’re using more and more freelancers to help out. Even though many people in USA were laid off, businesses still need their skills.
Since SB can’t afford full timers, they are turning to part timers, which includes freelancers from all platforms.

voters",N/A,N/A,N/A,jonbaas,4,"To be honest, this poll request isn’t likely to yield any valuable data. The experiences of each seller are different. I know sellers who are doing just fine during the months of COVID – just as they were before COVID. I know some who are even having fantastic sales levels. I also know some sellers who are seeing a slight drop in sales, but nothing noticeably connected to the global pandemic. And I still see countless new sellers (as I have for years) who have no sales at all because they aren’t doing anything to compete in the marketplace. Sales largely have nothing to do with the coronavirus at all, and everything to do with the seriousness, and the willingness of sellers to be proactive and build their own success – no matter what is happening in the world.
Let’s be mindful that we don’t fall into the trap of always trying to find something else to blame for our lack of success. If your sales aren’t at the level you want them to be, then change your tactics, experiment, find new ways to connect with your target customers.

Each one of my gigs went from top-3 best-selling to the bottom of the last page overnight and I gotta be honest… It sucks! I really hope that they fix this as investing 150% of your energy to build a good profile with a solid portfolio and make a brand out there to just get it all flushed down the toilet overnight just sucks. And I was just starting to get a really good amount of orders because I had the reviews, I made my gigs look the way I wanted them to look, I was getting decent impressions and my prices were fair and solid. I even took some steps in expanding my business because it was starting to get hard managing all the orders so I bought a drawing monitor for my cousin and I started teaching him what I do so that he can help me but I guess it won’t happen. If your theory is right I hope that they fire the dude who suggested this idea. A lot of sellers who were working hard and building their profiles providing amazing services are not getting any orders now since the beginning of May and their gigs are nowhere to be seen and some of them commented in the Forum that they will start to look for alternatives because having zero control over your gig ranking is discouraging. Imagine doing everything perfect - Solid amount of sells, competitive prices, unique service, professional looking gig with a perfect rating and then losing everything overnight without a real reason with 0 certainty if you’re going to ever get your ranking back after all of the hard work to make everything perfect to stay on the spot that you just lost.

Fiverr is a business. I can assure you, they are undoubtedly taking their business model VERY seriously. It would be bad business if they weren’t. And, since the search system isn’t broken, they’re doing well upholding their chosen business model.
hamza1424:

You do remember that the world is experiencing a pandemic, and millions of workers have lost their jobs, right? Perhaps Fiverr does not have the option of hiring new workers right now – especially when existing/remaining workers are staying home, and not able to work at the office like they once did. Just because you view things one way, doesn’t mean that Fiverr can as well.

I should be able to ask, if they don’t want to review than that’s a different thing.
By the way, I just say “please don’t forget to review” you shouldn’t say “give me 5 start review” that will definitely put you on radar.

Oftentime we observe that whenever there a pandemic took place in the world all the people are compelled to suffer through the pain of loosing their loved ones, loosing employment and going through monetary disadvantages. Which ulitimately throws a blow to their psychological stability. Resulting in the familial chaos and even random behavioural changes in some persons. Which is often termed as insanity.
Causes Behind Outspread :
Majority of the world population do not directly contribute to the formation of a chaotic situation like the current CODIV-19 pandemic, but a very few people can be called to be the ultimate responsibles behind it. Exploitation of the natual aroma or the coverage by practicing unimaginable food diet is one of the causes behind it. This is not very new the world has faced but there were famines which destroyed the civilised fabric of the world for several times. Yes, causes behind those things were still can be attributed to few people again because to carry on preventive measures all the governments were required to be prance but the absense of which opened the door for these evilsome disasters to come forth. Though the role of natural calamity can not be ignored at all.
But the entire blame can not be attributed to the handful of people because even after the outbreak of COVID-19 and instead of being fully aware of its preventive measures people are coming outsite, having fight with the implementors of the regulations and ultimately widening the evenue for the virus to come in.
So we can say that it is lack of “morality” and the “sense of Protection” that is generating the havoc. This kind of situations will again take place as the evidances from the future but amalgamation of awereness and proactive thinking with maorality will help us to reduce its intensity in future.
Roles Of Online Market Places In Situations Of Financial Crisis :
In our age-old days people faced the same situations again and again. They faced the same financial crisis with more severe outcomes.But in current era the situation have completed a full circle with the advent of Information Technology(IT) and its widespread to each and every corner of the world. As blessing of which new marketplaces like “fiverr” have come to us like the blessings from heaven. Earlier people have less employment opportunity. They either had to rely on their employers for their payments and the services but fiverr have changed the entire scenario by providing opportunity to all the sellers to choose their own services and also to generate a handsome revenue online sitting at home. In the current phase it is not possible to go outside for the search of an offline employment due to ongoing worldwide lockdown. But it does not prevent us from generating revenue as we have fiverr with us.Realising “the hero inside me”, as per the quote, has been made possible by this marketplace. It did not make us to realise that we are really in the lockdown state.
And when it comes to counter the “Psychological Instability” I would say, it provides us with plenty of work that there is no time to let our psyche turn instable. And the monetary needs are also getting supplemented.
Overall I,being a member of this fiverr communinty,am feeling honoured to get the opportunity to get into the regime, thanks to the team. Due to your effort many of the families are now supplementing their needs and many have turned itno well-off and famous beings just after working with you thus a greatest salute to you.

My sales have been affected by the Coronavirus, but otherwise! I have received more orders than ever in my entire stay here at Fiverr. I usually get 1 order every 1-2 months even though I am a level 1 and it was very frustrating. But now I always keep myself busy and when I finish orders new customers write to me, I have never felt what it is like to have several orders in a queue and I am surprised by all the work I am having.
All my new orders are helping me significantly to be promoted to level 2 in the next few months, when I thought I would get to be level 2 in 1-2 years.
I thought all of you would be doing well too, I thought something that was logical at the time, since no one can get out, it’s better to hire freelancers these days. No salary, no physical contact, no barriers = same (or better) result.
I was doing too badly in my Gigs, but this situation has improved everything and I know it was thanks to GOD and I think He is the reason for everything!
I hope that many of you will see a way out soon and can revolutionize your business, gain recognition, have more orders and success and that this story will serve to somehow awaken that faith and hope that everything will be alright.

Welcome to Fiverr and the Fiverr Forum.
I joined Fiverr 2.83 years ago, so I can say that I did not join Fiverr to feel productive during the pandemic.
I took a peek at your gigs. I noticed that you have a gig for proofreading school papers and essays. Fiverr TOS, which you agreed to when you joined Fiverr state:
Third-party TOS violation - By taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) you are actively taking part in a violation of the integrity code of most, if not all, schools and academic institutions. This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities.
Fiverr could give you an account warning or even remove your account for offering these services. It will be best for you to either delete or modify your gig not to provide to proofread school work.",N/A,"May 12, 2020 1:01 am",2020-07-29 18:20:07.490254

I saw this coming years ago. However I am starting to worry that I don’t have enough supplies ready for the supermarket shutdowns. In this case, I’m presently buying lots of vinegar. With this, I plan to pickle 500 eggs.
If I eat 5 pickled eggs a day, this will last me 100 days which is the approximate length of winter. After that, I can fish for my food.

My Fiverr-related business has slowed, BUT that opened up more time for my non-fiverr-based businesses to ramp up. I’ve had time to build out my studio, update and learn new software, take a few online learning courses that I could not have earlier due to the amount of work. Everything I do now is with the intent of what happens when this is all over (the lockdown and economic downturn). There are still opportunities to do more. I’ve began learning guitar, conversational Spanish and completed a couple of Adobe software certifications and every night I sit out on my patio and watch Netlix and drink a Modelo beer (I may have a pending drinking problem, but nobody’s perfect) and look at the stars.
I’ve seen bad before. I’ve been broke and homeless before, so that doesn’t really frighten me. My hopes for everyone is to stay healthy, find the opportunity in this pandemic to learn something - do something - say something or be something that you’ve always wanted to. I ask the question : When this ends, and it will end, what YOU do you want to be? It was Nietzsche that said “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how”. I focus on the “why”. It has been my experience that the “how” always takes care of itself. Those are just my thoughts.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2020 11:44 am",2020-07-29 18:20:21.774150

nah, I can skip working out today, I’ll make up for it tomorrow.
I am a man of culture, whenever I say “I can skip working out today”, it is never followed by “I’ll make up for it tomorrow”. Lol.
I haven’t gained any weight as I keep a close track on my diet, I actually lost a pound or two in last 2 months but I am surely not going to enjoy the sore muscles after I start the gym again.
Every night I decide to start working out and put my treadmill to good use, but in morning, I very conveniently “forget” it. I even installed a workout app, and uninstalled it, and installed it again. Hopefully I’ll start from tomorrow morning.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2020 2:12 pm",2020-07-29 18:20:27.712499

So far it’s mutated over 180 times as it adapts itself to it’s new human host.
There are now several vaccines being tried on volunteers.
This disease is so different from anything they’ve ever seen before that they can’t figure out the best way to treat patients yet. And they find more effects on the body every day from it.

Do you think epidemiologists are using Fiverr and would share their projections with you here?
Or do you think senior Fiverr sellers are studying disease patterns?
This is a really weird thing to ask Fiverr sellers…
If there is any available expert projections on this, you will find them by Googling it. It’s not going to be exclusive info that an epidemiologist will share in the Fiverr forum and hasn’t shared elsewhere.

Fair is when it’s win win or loose loose situation for both parties. What you are proposing is a win situation for you and loose situation for fiverr because they will loose cash from a bank that they are struggling with now. Why don’t you want to be empathetic to fiverr? Why do you only care about your immediate need and not the needs of a company that keeps you afloat?
That’s just some thing to think about and a different perspective. The same as
@urdeke
I also would’ve been happy with them decreasing pending clearance time. Well, actually no. At this point I don’t really care as I have a steady flow of money clearing every day so I don’t keep an eye on when they will be cleared anymore.

Of course they will loose. It’s a simple math: if instead of getting cash for 14 days they will get cash for only 7 days it means that they will loose 50% of what they could’ve get on interest from a bank
That 50% profit loss. how is that a win situation for fiverr if they are going to loose 50% of their profit on interest?
It’s like fiverr will tell you “you know how you used to pay only 20% on our fees, well not you have to pay 50% but don’t worry it’s a win win situation for you and for me because I charge you only 50% and not 90% and you still will get 2.5$ on your 5$ order”

And another perspective point of view: everyone loosing jobs right now and freelancing with online services is the only hope for everyone. So if this is your only hope and no stable job in offline then fiverr is your only way of making money? So that means if not for fiverr you wouldn’t have had income at all?

Difficult times is difficult for everyone. For sellers, for buyers and for companies including fiverr.

Look you are again thinking of how to make life easier for yourself. But let’s take an employment case because it’s still quite similar:
You are working for a company, then covid happens and market take a huge hit where your company is loosing money. Then you come to your boss and telling him “hey, you know it’s tough times right now and I think you should make it easier for me and instead of paying my salary once a month to start paying it twice a month because you need to care about your employees”. What do you think is going to happen to a company that’s already loosing money in a crisis and you are proposing to add extra work, extra payroll, less cash with bank interests and other implication that you don’t even think about? It simply might go bankrupt and then you wouldn’t even have a job not even talking about having your salary paid twice a month.
That’s how economics works. I see a lot of entitlement on the forum this “fiverr should do this, fiverr should do that, fiverr owes me this and that” where in reality they don’t. They recently IPOed and all their obligations is to their shareholders and their employees not to people who decided to use their platform, simple as that, that’s how capitalism works.

Again, you are giving a different example to something that doesn’t resonate to the lives of freelancers. Our lives in normal times and our lives now. Also, I am again underlining it … I have asked for a change to all the sellers … and not be partial to a specific community … If they decide to make a change, it will be for all … All would be the beneficiaries of it and would be proud of working on a platform that understands what they are going through. The scenario of getting paid twice a month never never resonates with the freelancer community … We all get paid after the work is completed + the duration of release (No exceptions here) … Also the company doesn’t pay me, the client does … So if the client has money to pay, the platform here has to just fasten the process once the work delivery is made.

Socialism or Capitalism … These times are different … If we don’t start thinking of everyone around us including animals, soon we shall be extinct. Everybody wants to earn money, no doubt. Everybody wants to survive, no doubt. But everyone can lessen the burden on others, reach out and help in some way or the other.

Plus, you can build just about any kind of building, fill it with a wide assortment of furniture and possessions, reshape entire neighborhoods, kill your sim, bring them back to life, visit ancient places… the list goes on.

The virus will continue to spread so that in a year everyone in the country will have been exposed to it. We have mostly been staying inside for the past month or two everywhere but now people are starting to act as if it’s all over and starting to go outside and act like nothing has happened.",N/A,"May 4, 2020 3:47 am",2020-07-29 18:22:05.153721

They don’t make it easy. Here is what one state requires you to fill out which may not be possible if you are a freelancer on fiverr:
Before filing, make sure you have the following information available:
Social Security number
Driver’s license or State ID number
Your employment for the last 18 months including for each employer:

** * First and last day of work**
** * Gross earnings (before taxes are taken out) during the listed dates**
** * The reason for separation**
** * FEIN (this is found on any W2 or 1099 tax forms you have received)**
** * If you don’t have the FEIN, you can use employer details off of a recent paystub **
** * Claims filed without correctly reporting employers may experience** delays. It is important to list the correct employment information when filing your claim.

In this situation it will be sped up to hopefully 1.5 years realistically speaking. Longer if they find out the vaccines they are developing are not safe.
They have to test them on thousands of people over a period of time to make sure they are safe, and then manufacture and distribute them.
So far in the US they have only tested about 1% of our population so that needs to be increased in the meantime although nothing is being done to help that apparently.
Currently they do not even know if once someone is exposed and gets the virus if they develop enough antibodies to the virus to stop them from getting it again.

I joined Fiverr recently because our whole country is in lockdown mode, so no more going to office and all that day job. Thought give this a try while I stay home safe.
I read some topics here; most of them are people asking question and sharing their experiences about how their gigs went down and how they are not getting any new orders.
Don’t get discouraged and give up people. Take me for an example, getting into Fiverr knowing numbers and sales are going down, but still wanting to try out new things and make new connections. Let’s keep this alive until we win this corona fight TOGETHER.
STAYING HOME is the best way to stop this pandemic. Then we all can get back to our normal lives back again very soon. Always take the necessary steps recommended by doctors.

If you are a designer then you don’t need to advertise your services with “coronavirus” in your title. It’s like bad marketing and you are trying to attract people and making hype on epidemia. Fiverr doesn’t want you speculating around such a sensitive topic.

I am from the translation sector. Normally I am getting between 100 and 120 orders a month. In peak times in the summer of last year I even had 200! I am mostly judging my statistics and how I am performing off of my impressions. In normal times I am fluctuating between 60-80k.
Right now the statistics are dropping down like crazy for me. Luckily I am still getting orders from my old clients here and there but as of tomorrow I will be in the situation of not having a single active order on my dashboard for the first time in 3 1/2 years since I started. That is making me feel really uncomfortable thinking about the statistics.
Right now the number of orders is fluctuating between 59 and 70 but all the other values are basically in free fall. The impressions which is my go-to factor for performance is at 18k right now and not going to stop dropping anytime soon.
Judging by normal numbers it is a complete desaster. However on the flipside, when I actually look my gig up in the listing I am placed on the first page in the first two rows so I am basically in the top 8 or 10? And that means that I am still doing well compared to others?
My biggest fear is that the statistics drop to a point where it will be so low that it can’t recover after this whole thing is over. Like my Proofreading gig has 270 impressions and maybe got 3 or 4 orders total over the last 3 years. Returning clients will keep the whole thing running I think but I am generally concerned about the effect of the statistics in general and what the algorhythm does or doesn’t do to me when the whole thing is over and things get going again.
How are you thinking about that whole thing? Are you fine as long as your listing is pretty high even if the statistics drop or are statistics everything that matters in the end? I’d like to get a general idea if I will be fine if I just let it happen.

I’ve noticed this a few years ago. Every time there is a massive sales drop (covid-related or not) to the point that I check the position in the search results, my gig is in the first row of the first page. When my gig is doing well, however, it’s closer to the bottom of the first page or sometimes on page two.
I have no idea what that means. I just told myself that it was fiverr’s way to calm me down and show that my gig is not on fire and everything’s fine when it clearly isn’t and moved on.",N/A,"Apr 27, 2020 5:10 pm",2020-07-29 18:23:31.502983

I’ve been with Fiverr for seven years and have built up a steady client base in that time - but I’ve seen my orders drop away in recent weeks. Try not to analyse the stats too much. They’re mostly utter blah. If you’ve got something decent to sell (and you clearly have) - then when people are ready, they will buy.
The world will get back to normal again. Or it might find a new normal in the meantime. However, I suspect that countries are going to have different languages for some time to come - therefore your valuable skills as a translator will be in demand once again.
It’s just an odd time at the moment - but this time will pass. It really will.",N/A,"Apr 27, 2020 5:15 pm",2020-07-29 18:23:31.918155

I totally get that many people are not prioritizing to spend money right now because they are way more concerned about having enough money to survive right now and that is why no one buys anything at the moment which is perfectly fine. I’ve had some weird experiences with the statistics in the past and so I am being extremely cautious when something changes drastically.
But yeah I am confident that once everything is back to (the new) normal things will be running again. My only fear is that the Fiverr algorhythm doesn’t care about the pandemic at all Let’s just hope that we will make it!

As for the specific question of ‘good plan B’, I can say that there has been a huge influx of people thinking the exact same thing. It all depends on if the plan was/is actually a plan and not a whim.
You’ve been here since December, according to your account, so you already know that it’s not as simple as making a gig to make sales. The ‘conditions’ are even more saturated now. Plan B might still work, but it’ll take work, a lot of work, to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.

Do you have current customers that are working more in this season? I see tons of new video commercials and ads from companies that are distributing media right now. Much of the work can be completed online and not in person.
I have an active account on Fiverr. I have seen a 30% increase in my business during the crisis. People have gone home and now they have time to complete the things they have been too busy to finish. They are less distracted now.
There is economic unrest which will keep some people from paying their bills. You and I just need a small percentage of work from the people who can spend.

With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the business went south. It’s so hard to find new (local) clients since everyone is afraid to pay. Even our current customers are delaying payments.

please follow the guidelines of your National Health Care facility .

So , it is a strange phinominal change that happens today .

voters",N/A,1,"Apr 25, 2020 2:00 pm",csnet1,3,"Let me tell from both regular seller and Fiver PRO, definitely there’s a hit in both markets.
PRO Gigs (that are usually tailored for businesses and enterprises) do suffer, and most of customers are very clear about Covid impact on their budget. This is not something you could put into ‘negotiations technique’ to drop the price, they are really struggling to keep their businesses up and running. Budgets are limited if not drained.
As for the regular gigs, situation is essentially the same budget wise. However I noticed increased amount of unethical behaviour by new comers. It’s no strange you get contacted to discuss an order, spend some time explaining the techniques just to see your gig actually got replicated. Even more strange, some low priced gigs that are executed for years with rating of 5 suddenly receive rating of 2. Could be a coincidence, but if that trend continues (for the same level of delivery quality) I could only assume many people lost their jobs, trying to make additional income and as it always goes - when you need to support your family many would do whatever needed to get their visibility - even if that means making harm to others. Could not blame them - though caution is needed.
Let me give a breakdown of type of inquires prior to Covid and now. (In area of cyber security and data protection).
Prior: 90% of initial messages were coming from legit businesses looking for professional analysts to protect their data and analyse vulnerabilities.
Now: 80% of initial messages could be described as “R U able to Hack my Bank / University / You name it” - type of requests that you need to reject - that further impact your conversion rate.
I think we are all going to be affected, what’s important is to keep the business dignity, continue delivering excellence and the situation will get better. Probably some action would be taken by Fiverr itself to help maintain this platform healthy. If we are hit - they are being hit as well. (if we do - they do).
I also noticed that customer are more nervous due to whole situation therefore level of tolerance is much lower - sometimes making orders without reading description which leads to cancelation etc…
Anyhow let’s try what we can as a sellers. Add value added services, try to overdeliver and help these in needs and situation will hopefully get better. I have no doubt Fiverr is also closely monitoring situation trying to pull-out best approach. Let’s give them some time - so far, they never failed.",N/A,"Apr 23, 2020 3:18 pm",2020-07-29 18:25:12.910143

Your (I will design professional and minimalist business card) gig is really good but I think buyers are messaging you or requesting custom offers for other things as well. Because in your business card gig portfolio I’m seeing other type of works. Why don’t you create more gigs. Logo design, Banner design etc… I mean you’re a graphic designer & I think web design work is just temporary for you. If your main gig is related to graphic design then focus on it & improve your skills. Don’t worry,…

My sales have definitely taken a hit. Especially the large orders that businesses used to place. Since most businesses are currently shut down or experiencing other issues, those orders have stopped coming in and my revenue has taken a big hit as a result.
My gig went down, because of corona virus

You can’t give your services free as it’s fiverr policy that the minimum order is 5$ on fiverr.

Yes, many are not penalizing people for not paying — but some are saying if you don’t pay before it’s over that they will still assess late charges at the end of the period. So if you go 3 months without paying that company, at the end of the 3 months they will add $117USD ($39USD/month late fee, this is my credit card company) so it all is still due with additional penalties on top of it at the end of the “emergency” — this is not sustainable.

I’ve had an open order with a new buyer for almost 20 days now. They ordered a 5-email campaign without chatting with me first. (I know some of us are fine with that, but for me it strongly affects the quality of work I can do for them.) From their requirements, I wasn’t able to figure out their “goal” for the emails. I wrote back suggesting an outline, and they wrote back suggesting a separate one. Not a problem at all, but it required a lot of additional information and resources from their side that they said they’d provide and that I’ve now requested multiple times.
Once the clock ticked down the first time without an answer, I sent an extension that they accepted.
The Buyer has checked in once since then (a week ago) to let me know things are busy on their end and they’d send me the info soon. It’s 100% understandable to be busy in this time - but they’ve essentially gone dark while keeping the order open and not responding to my reminders (despite the fact that they’ve been on Fiverr).
I know that this is an average day on Fiverr, believe me. I have compassion for the chaos they must be encountering and have been very patient, but I’m getting anxious about the lack of response. With 4 days left, I’ve checked in once more to ask whether they want A) to extend further or B) me to complete the order based on the original outline I proposed (which I do have the info for). I didn’t suggest cancellation because why should they be able to hurt my stats when they ordered without really knowing what they wanted?

Why don’t you try to deliver your campaign like a template based on the outline you proposed?
and deliver them with a note that you can do changes as required in future without any additional cost!
This way you can keep your order and reputation…

fiverr is owned by stockholders. The top executives cannot do things like that without the approval of the majority of stockholders probably. And there is no doubt whatsoever they wouldn’t approve of it.
That’s not necessarily true. Companies make many decisions everyday without consulting the stockholders. If the CEO or founder owns 51% of the stock or more, no can can fire him, he can do whatever he wants, and all stockholders can do is sell their stocks or badmouth him in the press.
If you read about Travis Kalanick, founder of Uber, you’ll discover it was extremely difficult to remove him from Uber. His only mistake was not controlling 51% of his company, even then, he had crazy rules about shares with voting power, non-voting shares, etc. He had rules that if you bought one Uber stock, he got two. This was before the company went public, back when it was funded by angel investors and venture capitalists.
It is true that anyone can file a lawsuit, but whether a judge will let it proceed or reject it with or without prejudice, is a different matter. Lawsuits are also public record. I’m a private person, if I sue a company, my privacy would be compromised. I would have reporters asking me why I’m suing.
Also, Fiverr has
31.94M shares
44.81% are held by insiders (the president, executives, etc)
46.56% by institutions (banks, hedge funds, companies, etc)
So even if I was a billionaire and managed to control 10% of the stock, it wouldn’t be enough for a hostile takeover. The only way to do that would be by getting institutions to sell their stock to me until I reach 51%. That would be hard to do because Fiverr would do the same, not to mention buyback their own stock.
I don’t know why Fiverr charges fees they didn’t charge when they started. Why 20% of an order isn’t enough. I don’t think it’s because they need the money, I think it’s because they know we’re not going anywhere, and they don’t care if buyers get annoyed when they pay fees.
Those fees are a mistake, just like the $1 we used to pay to PayPal was a mistake that Fiverr corrected. That $1 fee was easy to tolerate because we might be withdrawing $100 or more, so it’s hard to notice $1. But when you make a $5 order and the bill is $7, you will notice that. If Fiverr is going to charge those fees, the least they could do is display the real price on our gig pages. That way our buyers will know they’re paying $7 instead of $5.",N/A,"Apr 10, 2020 4:53 pm",2020-07-29 18:26:27.581589

Sir if someone hires you to do a job then you do it. I’m sure anyone who gets big orders is able to find other sellers if they need them.
They do not seek out sellers who never get sales though. They use sellers whom they know will do the job correctly.
This is not a charity and I do wish people would stop thinking that way.
I’ve had a barrage of sellers in the past week begging, asking me to give them work. And here on the forum I see more and more threads like this where people say sellers should give sellers without any sales work.

There’s no distribution of work on Fiverr. We’re not company employees working together on the same project. There are users with no orders who believe that sellers with many orders owe it to them to give them some of those sales, but that’s not how Fiverr works. Spend some time on the forum and you’ll see them.

Well, we do live in an era of emergency communism at present. How people haven’t figured out yet that it is a bit silly to pay taxes if the government can force you to not to go to work, print as much money it wants, and give everyone free cash, is a bit beyond me.
However, there are now actually very few examples of more aggressively communist states in history. - And apparently this is the new normal. If only Richard Nixon could see us now.
All that said, distributing orders is just silly. It implies that everyone is as aptly capable as the next seller. I have ordered from sellers above and below my price bracket, and the truth is, the level of quality varies to a ridiculous degree.

No it’s not. First of all, “trusted seller” doesn’t appear from nowhere, with trusted seller es you already have established relationships.
Secondly it’s only good for you when someone gives you work that you didn’t fight for but there is nothing good for other seller as he will loose his revenue.

It’s up to the seller to decide.
In my world not. If a buyer wants to hire me, then I will do the job, or I’ll tell them I can’t/don’t want to do the job.
Also, “surplus work” distributes itself.When I have more work than I can do, I pause my gigs = buyers don’t see them in search = they’ll choose another seller = work gets distributed (and buyer chooses to whom).
Or if I generally can do smaller jobs still, so I won’t pause my gigs, I’ll tell buyers who have bigger jobs to do, when I can be done with their gig and they can choose to wait or go search a different seller.
The point is that it’s not up to the seller to decide but to the buyer.
Fiverr has already in-built “work distribution” via several channels - the options to limit orders in queue, to pause gigs, and go into out of office mode, as well as rotating which gigs are displayed on which page/to which buyers.
If a seller outsources work, they should clearly state that; by default buyers will assume that the seller they hire will do the job, rightly so.",N/A,"Apr 10, 2020 3:01 am",2020-07-29 18:27:17.328827

I would like it if we could raise the level of the forum a bit.
Sadly, the foundation isn’t in place to clean it up. The vagueness of some things make it difficult to report things that are amiss.
For example, one of the most common questions is about ‘the algorithm’. There is an actual statement by Fiverr on this (“Gig positions are not permanent and can rotate on a daily basis.”) that can be found here, https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/levels-warnings-and-status under Gig Status, in the second drop-down. But in order to find this information, you have to know what to search and where to search. (Does the location of this information, for this very Frequently Asked Question, make sense?)
I don’t think there has been a day since this new-seller-boom started that I haven’t run out of “Other” flags for duplicate threads. There was even a day recently that I ran out of edits for moving threads into the correct categories. Short answer: Those of us who would like to see the forums improve can’t do anything about it. Not to the scale needed.
Then there’s the ‘tips’ category. There are many new threads that are made that are mere parroting, but they’re technically not incorrect, and thus can’t be flagged with the usual “Off-Topic,” “Inappropriate,” or “Spam” flags, due to the definition that is attached to those flags. Thus that leaves the “Other” flag, and I already mentioned that I already run out of those. This means triage, and flagging only the worst offenders.
And this doesn’t even touch on resurrecting old threads that might be relevant to the new post but thus can’t be flagged, and still leaves a zombie in recent activity, which only encourages more new posts.

you’re right and I never even thought about how we turn the faucets on and off, contaminating them.
How can we do it without putting our germs on them? Use a paper towel to turn them on and off? I’m going right now to disinfect my faucets.

I clean the parts of the faucet I touched with soap and water when I’m done, I figure if it kills viruses on your hands, it will kill them on the faucet too.
For now, I generally clean door handles, faucets and such things more often and more rigorously than usual.
I guess during/after Corona, we’ll see more and more touch-free solutions like infrared faucets and automatic sliding doors not just in airports but in public buildings, restaurants and so on and probably as well in private houses … perhaps things like house doors opening via iris scan, even sliding or self-opening letter slots will become popular?
A Timid New World where nobody, including you, will touch anything on or in your house at all or before washing hands? Door lintels that do total decontamination like in science fiction, whether people want to be decontaminated or not, would be nice too But, seriously, I’m pretty sure that this crisis will see more people thinking about and favoring touch-free solutions.
I’m seriously amazed by how many people use the bar to open the door to the building of a local mall (mall per se is closed but you may enter to visit the drugstore inside the mall) - while there’s the super simple no-tech solution of just using your arm or shoulder or foot, which is what I do, I never used that bar even before corona, actually, there’s the common flu and whatnot too, after all.

Also this can be regulated, by only offering fees reductions to sellers that participate in this initiative, this can be well administrated with the tools they have so this initiative works in the expected way and preventing people taking advantage for a selfish purpose. I’m not sure what holiday situation are you referring too, I have not seen anything similar to what I’m proposing here so far, well not in Fiverr.
Actually this is not an original idea, I saw that other platforms are doing this, e.g. Codementor, basically they are recruiting mentors (sellers) that want to donate time or offer discounts, so if others are doing this there should be a good strategy behind, and I also think they are considering the risks you are mentioning, however, I strongly believe this kind of acts are an investment and can result in bigger benefits in the long run.
In other words, this race has already started, doesn’t matter if Fiverr wants to participate or not, others will do and will be remembered by that.",N/A,"Mar 26, 2020 9:41 pm",2020-07-29 18:27:50.542366

Fiverr is a marketplace and they are also a commercial company, they also need to worry about themselves, they have salaries to pay and less orders for sellers is less revenue for fiverr. Just an FYI their losses for 2019 we’re equal to their profit

Fiverr itself has just started contributing to charitable funds designed to help freelancers suffering from reduced income in the U.S.

Ok. To do this, go and register as a charity in your country. Once you are officially recognized as a charity, reach out to Fiverr itself. In the meantime or if you are not prepared to go this route, stop trying to guilt-trip people into free or discounted work.
Stand by your convictions, practically put them into practice, and then come back looking for a free labor force. Once you are an officially recognized charity, you will stand a better chance of getting people on board with your project.

are you saying that Fiverr is not doing the best they can due to a bad administration that turned into disappointments for sellers like the Holiday problem?, so at the end of the day not really against the idea just don’t believe is possible, is this right?
Sort of, but not really.
Think of it like a blood drive. There are already reputable places a person can go to donate, but sometimes a company might host a location for a drive. While this is good of the company, by no means should they try to play doctor. So, if a company tries to do a drive without proper technicians, they’re not actually helping anyone. If they do try to do things properly, it takes time to arrange all the qualified people.
Fiverr doesn’t have the channels within the platform to take donations. Because they know this, they’re directing people to donate elsewhere.
As for if they could in the future, it’s possible, but the site is already buggy. Implementing more rushed, broken programming in an attempt to help, won’t help.
You mentioned Codementor. I’ve never heard of them. I’d rather donate to Red Cross.
We’re on Fiverr. I know them all too well. I’d rather donate to RedCross.

time from sellers that are willing to donate some actual work or provide discounts but in an official way
This is an interesting proposal, and if Fiverr already had proven systems in place, I might consider it. As it stands, I already plan on donating my time to my local community, where I can see that I’m making an impact, and not have to worry as much about being scammed.
As for Fiverr taking leadership, I’ll have to agree with misscrystal in that there is much they aren’t permitted to do. That said, they have stepped up in other ways, and I doubt we’ve seen the end of it.
If the channels are available we still might see something. It’s still very early in this crisis, and I’d rather a bit of time spent to make sure things will go smoothly, then seeing mistakes made in the midst of panic. Fear makes people irrational. Irrational people do dumb things.
isaackrauss:
What do you think?
I think that is a very long run-on sentence.
As for the content of that wall-o-text:
On the note of what is donated, no I was not limiting my example to money. That’s partially why I used a blooddrive as an example. I’m am aware that resources encompass time, talent, skill, labor, your very body (I’m a registered organ donar and I’ve already mentioned blood), belongings, intangibles like prayer and being available to just listen to someone, yes money too, and so on.
There are already too many ‘sources’ out there clamoring for attention and echoing much the same message. As much as extra exposure would be nice, I’ve already accepted responsibility for my own success and am not going to rely on a maybe.
I fully understand the urge to just do something, to want to help. But I also refuse to be taken advantage of again because I was too trusting and took action without considering the possible consequences. (Yes, again, but that’s private.)
It is late where I am, so it’s again time to log off. (And also because it’s late, I may have made typos, but I’m not going to proofread myself for once.)

Can you explain the logic behind what you are asking for?
The average cost to have a website designed is $1K to $10K off Fiverr.
On Fiverr, you can hire people to create a basic site for less than $100.
I could go on listing hundreds of other services that you can get cheaper on Fiverr than elsewhere. This is the basic USP of Fiverr.
You can shop here for services that literally suit any budget. In this case, what do you ideally want Fiverr to do?
There are also already several platforms that exist where freelancers can connect with charities and offer to work for free or for discounted rates. If sellers here have time available they can use these or help organizations in their area.
I’m sorry, but you can say “wouldn’t it be a good idea for Fiverr freelancers to donate time and their skills to organization affected by Covid-19.” However, you aren’t defining what exactly you want to see happen, and you are making a few potentially harmful assumptions.
How do you know sellers aren’t already doing this?
You are overlooking the fact that thousands, possibly even millions of small businesses would not exist today if it weren’t for the fact that Fiverr allows them to buy top of the line marketing services for a fraction of the cost of these elsewhere.
You are overlooking the fact that charities and non-profits already use Fiverr to source discounted freelance talent.
Saying that Fiverr should do something implies that there are barriers preventing sellers from doing exactly what you want them to, but there are not.
I already know of several sellers on Fiverr who are donating excess/redundant PC power to organizations fighting Covid-19.
In this case, what exactly do you want Fiverr or sellers here to do?",N/A,"Mar 27, 2020 10:32 pm",2020-07-29 18:28:05.940224

If expletives weren’t banned here, I’d have about 5 for you right now.
Here’s another thing though. Why since this started are people from the same countries where $5 goes quite a long way, suddenly begging for handouts?
Did you spend all your spare dosh while you had it on feeding the local poor or oppressed? If so, I must have missed all the posts celebrating that in my 6-years here. Curiously, though, I do remember posts about buying new cars, super gaming PCs, and a few by a few people that seemed to delight in pointing out the fact that they were considerably wealthier than their peers.
Now, stop begging. You’ll have much better luck trying to find a way to go back in time and open a savings account.
I’m also sorry if pointing out the blatantly obvious here is upsetting to anyone. However, I find it upsetting getting messages like this every day:
Hi hun.
Sorry cancel that shopping please. Sorry about this… But the ten euro’s I mentioned is the only money I have now till after the 21st of this month due to 120 Euro I’m still owed from work not coming in.
So sadly now I have to find the money as my landlady is not going to be happy if I can’t pay her this month and it’s not like I have family I can as for a lone till it’s sorted.
I will catch up with you soon. Take care and keep safe
Only then to come here and see people putting on a cash-strapped Mother Teresa routine. Any more begging (regardless of how it is dressed) needs to start resulting in bans. It’s rude, very insensitive, and more than extremely annoying.",N/A,"Apr 8, 2020 11:10 am",2020-07-29 18:28:22.779051

zeshan92hashmi:
Due to fear, there is tragedy and suffering. In the face of fear, we must choose to stay strong and stand together, no matter our origin. If we don’t stand together, humanity may fall. It’s time to unite, to help, and work together. But instead, there’s an insurgence of selfishness, and a lack of responsibility. We need to put the survival of humanity before our selves.
Stop fighting. Stop blaming. We are all in this together. If we don’t change our attitudes, things will get worse.
Below all the loud surface fighting, there are people taking malicious advantage of the situation. One example is the fake ‘cure’ of alcohol, spread by social media with no source cited, that has resulted in suffering. We have a duty to verify rumors, to confirm or disclaim, before forwarding it as truth, especially when it’s dealing with something this dangerous. There are too many voices, too many fronts, too many fights, and no one can seem to agree on anything.
Only truth can combat the fear and lies. We need to know the gap of the spread and countermeasures.

I was in the middle of conversation for few projects when lockdown in US happened and buyers postponed the projects saying they don’t know how COVID-19 is going to impact their business so they’d hold for now.
It’s same for everyone I guess since the entire world is facing this pandemic, some more than others. All we gotta do is to wait and hope for the things to get better.

Don’t worry. If things get tough, you can crash with me for free rent and food. All you will need to do is clean and kill my enemies.
Sadly, I don’t have any other advice than that. Apparently hand washing is big at the moment. However, soap suds hardly pay the bailiffs.
All that said, you could dress as a doctor and go door to door offering to wash other people’s hands. Just remember to put some fine print on your stethoscope saying ""Not an Actual Doctor.""

We could even enjoy long walks on the beach while we’re at it.
Alas, a long walk along my local beach constitutes five paces across a tiny slither of sand that at night becomes a giant communal cat litter tray.
We could go on long kayak adventures. That would also provide the perfect cover for disposing of any enemies you take out for me…

Perfect time to flex and say I know how to make pretty decent handmade soaps.
Again, another excellent way of disposing of enemies.
We could start an Etsy store selling a unique,Tyler Durden inspired line of cosmetics. I also know a few things about candle making which I guess is similar to soap making. You put ice cubes in the mix. Then when the candle or soap sets, they melt and you get funky looky swiss cheese-like designs. (You also save on wax.)

I’m currently the only person I know in my family or friends group that has covid-19 symptoms. UK testing is pretty much non-existent unless you’re in hospital, but I’m 100% sure I have it. Sudden onset persistent, dry cough with pre-flu symptoms? Never experienced that in my life. Would be a mighty coincidence if it’s anything else. I’m worried for the elderly and high-risk folks in my community, but for myself this has mostly just been a surreal experience more than anything else. I only leav…

How are YOU doing?
COVID-19 Discussions
Hi everyone. If you’re like me, you’ve been getting these “What are we doing” emails from companies about COVID-19. And… that’s great. Thanks for letting me know random company I bought that one thing from 5 years ago. I want to ask how YOU are doing and if there’s anything we as a community can do to help support you during this strange time around the world. Personally, I’m in the SF Bay Area and we’re on FULL “shelter in place” orders. I’m working from home now with three kids (all under 6)…",N/A,"Mar 30, 2020 1:23 pm",2020-07-29 18:29:45.745608

I hope you are not insinuating that this should have been a man’s job!
In either case, fixing toilets is pretty easy once you know how they work. At least you now have a new skill you can monetize in the post-Covid world of Fallout 4.
It’s airlocks in taps that really drive you round the bend. However, if it comes to that, linking your hot and cold tap with a piece of hose and turning on the one that works will usually fix things.

Well, at least you’re managing to continue life as normal.
Sadly, this lockdown is playing havoc with my cleaning routine. Typically, this involves buying new plates from the dollar store. At the rate things are going, I’m going to have to buy a new set of pans, plates, and cutlery when this is over.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.
We know this isn’t just affecting our community. It’s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.
We know this isn’t just affecting our community. It’s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need. We wouldn’t be where we are today without our incredible community, and we’re here to offer support in any way we can during this difficult time.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers.

At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.

We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

Think about the time you are going to put into it and be aware that if you are among the first people to be getting funds paid to you, it really doesn’t look good.

“You can create a Union on your side, not for personal gain but to rally help the community and your coworkers. Freelancers Relief Fund also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.”
So as you can see that currently I will make a small donation site & then maybe someday a Union for Freelancers in India
Yes 48 hours for a 3 page site is possible. Donation page, About Page. FAQ (That’s all I want to make right now)
I will not use any other Payment Gateway except “Paypal” because of several reasons. Trust, Security & Transparency
Doing the little things can make a big difference. Thank so so much once again

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.
We know this isn’t just affecting our community. It’s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

Great initiative. But to promote the link on the forum We need acknowledgment from Fiverr Staff.
Personally, I do not want to see a single link on this forum for any charity.
What on Earth is everyone thinking? Do homeless people try and improve their situation by asking other homeless people to donate to their new homeless charity? Did people in Haiti all club together after the earthquake and ask each other for money? If you need to lend a fiver, do you ask someone else who hasn’t got one?
Everyone is suddenly rushing to start charities. Where was this level of social responsibility a month ago?
The ;last time I looked, there were homeless people a month ago. There were also people dying every day around the world because of poverty, poor sanitation, slum living, and zero access to medical care.- Right on the doorsteps, I might add, of what seems to me like most of the people now pleading for charity here.
Meanwhile, banks are putting UP charges, governments are doling out money to corporations that were already in the red before this, and the last time I looked, hardly any of the big tech companies in the world were paying any taxes.
Like it or not, we are also now about to enter a massive financial depression. What are freelancers here expecting? For people to donate money to them in perpetuity until it’s over?
This is now beyond ridiculous. IF someone anywhere starts a charity in their country that it can be independently validated as legitimate by checking with that countries tax authority (not simply by it having a website), that charity can contact Fiverr officially and maybe get a mention here.
Otherwise, I (as well as lots of other people) am now sick of coming here everyday, just to be faced with a new e-begging plea dressed up a little differently.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.

We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

Personally, I do not want to see a single link on this forum for any charity.
Agreed %. I talked about this earlier in another thread. Coupled with the fact that people are taking advantage of this pandemic making a profit. At the end of the day donating to me is taking a chance. We really don’t know where the money will end up. We don’t know if these families will receive the money.
Many freelancers from all over the globe are suffering not just the U.S. freelancers.

That said, I have made sure to adjust my business, look at new options, consider what I can do to attract clients etc. As a result, I have only got around 15-20% less orders than in the last couple of months.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.
The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.
We know this isn’t just affecting our community. It’s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship — illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities — as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.
We know this isn’t just affecting our community. It’s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we’re here to help, that’s why Fiverr and AND.CO 6 are contributing to the Freelancers Relief Fund 92. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need.

As shutdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19 take place across the U.S., independent workers face potential short-term and long-term economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country’s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers’ bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities — for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.

Seriously, where do you guys take all this ideas about distributing orders. Clients are choosing specific sellers and they do not want their order to be distributed to someone whom they didn’t choose.
Here is another topic with “your idea” of communist distribution.
Work distribution
COVID-19 Discussions
Hey Everyone, I read multiple threads about some people getting a lot of work and some getting none of it. Wouldn’t it be good if those who are getting a lot of work to distribute the workload (Obviously if they are unable to do it all) with those ones who aren’t getting any , to get most out of it.

I’m not about to “give” anyone my orders and I’m sure no one else is either.

Personally, I’m in the SF Bay Area and we’re on FULL “shelter in place” orders. I’m working from home now with three kids (all under 6)…",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 1:48 pm",2020-07-29 18:31:41.899283

Supposedly, empty shelves are not a shortage but a logistics issue.
Thankfully, however, I haven’t seen any prices going up so far for the things that sell out all the time, apart from that whatever you are looking for, of course, the most expensive brands remain on the shelves the longest, so if you really need to buy tp, not just to hoard, you might be looking at higher prices for the super duper soft luxury tp.
I haven’t seen or heard of shops here placing restrictions on stuff yet either, but I guess that might be coming, to ensure that the people who don’t hoard, can get things too.
Indeed, if you go to the supermarket after 9pm on a Saturday, you won’t see a single pack of tp, I didn’t see any flour or sugar either. Personally, I prefer to stock food that will serve me in any sort of crisis, like no electricity, or light and small enough to throw in a backpack if I have to leave the house (I’ve lived in flood-ridden areas) but yeah.
Many people seem to be afraid that supermarkets/food shops/drugstores will either be closed or not getting re-stocked.
If they wanted to raise prices, they’d surely get away with it practically, people who could would still buy, but I think they’d be told no by the authorities if they actually did it.
That’s for normal shops, there are the odd “crisis entrepreneurs” who put up hand sanitizer on ebay for high prices, yes.
Prices of things that will become more expensive to produce/transport/provide/keep in quarantine because of the situation obviously might increase sooner or later.

lenasemenkova:
Btw, are you considered a risk group if you have heavy seasonal respiratory allergies? I’m doomed if that’s the case.
Good question. What I can tell you since I get hayfever myself, the answer from the Foundation German Pollen Information Service is NO (the all-caps is a quote, in translation, not shouting at you ;)), people with pollen allergies/hayfever, even allergic asthma, don’t have a higher risk or an immunological weakness, their defense against bacteria and viruses is normal. They should continue their therapies/use medication as usual, no changes needed. I’m no medical professional, though, unfortunately. Just the information I found when looking for it.
ETA: However, it seems it could be a good idea to change to meds that don’t contain corticoids if you don’t really need them (like switching from OTC pills with corticoids to topical sprays etc. without to relieve your symptoms. Of course, anyone who needs to take prescribed meds, must consult their doctor before changing anything.",N/A,"Mar 15, 2020 11:58 am",2020-07-29 18:31:59.110316

Great suggestion Miss Crystal.
Alternative paper to use if you run low on toilet paper.
These suggestions aren’t popular but if push comes to shove. You can use newspaper, magazine paper, old clothes, notebook paper, printer paper. Of course, it won’t be as soft and plush but it’ll get the job done. Eek! Also, you have facial tissues like (Kleenex), paper towel, and feminine or baby wipes.

You can teach a child to have a strong moral compass when it comes to business. However, they will get walked all over later in life if they actually try to practice what you preach.
In some cases maybe or maybe not.
Teaching a child to never be a doormat in society is a plus. In the world of business, essentially it’s survival of the fittest. That doesn’t mean a person must sell their souls to the corporate devil. Sure, there’s greed, deceit, and everything else. I know a few people who sold their souls, socks, legs, eyeballs, etc. to get ahead in life. In some cases it backfired and other cases they thrived. Yes, this is a bad, evil and cruel world, people thinking it’s a big basket of roses are sorely mistaken. However, all one needs is the wit, the personality, and the skills to navigate through this colorful and polarized world on their own terms. The issue is people are taking advantage of this situation. People are overly stressed and upset that they cannot find food and other essential items.Why? Because people want to turn a profit. I went to the grocery store and people were quarreling over milk. One lady had a basket full with at least 10 gallons. People asked her if they could have one she said NO and arguments ensued. Wow, it was nuts!
We’ll be dealing with this pandemic going through 2021. I’d be very surprised if it ends before 2021.

How are things in Malta?
Well, a week ago things were normal. Now, though, we’re on the cusp of being a police state. That’s how I see it, even if some might see it as a necessity. (And a lot of people here do.)
I’m a facts and figures man though, and I just say it like it is. From tomorrow, all but essential businesses have to close. In practice, that means low-paid (4.50 - 5 Euro an hour) employees of bars, restaurants, etc don’t have a job. Average rents are 500 a month. In this case, all will be struggling in 30-days or less.
A couple I know have a shop that they pay 600 Euros rent for after 450 for their apartment, and they were struggling already. A month of this and they will be out of business. In short, the small business scene is kaput and if the next step is mandatory quarantine, people are going to be beat down by fines for just walking their dogs or going to use an ATM. (This has already happened to tourists.)
I’m lucky in that I get my shopping from a mobile grocer who told me today that even in total lockdown, he will still be allowed to make deliveries if I call him. However, I still have a wage coming in. As of tomorrow, most of my street won’t.
Then there is the matter of the homeless population. Here it’s tiny compared to other places in the EU. However, it does exist and no one really seems to want to talk about the implications of that.
My main concerns personally are how I walk Chico if we do go into full lock down. I’m actually relieved that my other dog passed away, as there was no way you could keep her cooked up in the house. Thankfully, Chico knows that he can go in the house if he really needs to. However, he is not used to not having at least 2 long walks a day.

Hi there, Greetings! Hope you all are well. I’m here since 2017. Day by day the performance is going well. But is this year a caution for me? Why? Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))! Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos.

The sounds of horns, chatter and hurried commotion have been the constant backdrop for life over here.
But all that changed overnight.
While the whole country was hoping that it wouldn’t get worse, it did. On the 25th of March, at 8 PM IST, our leader announced a complete shutdown for 21 days, starting that midnight; no warning, no time to prepare.
I don’t go out much these days, because of the amount of work I do and the lack of things to do in this town, but on the 26th evening, I did venture out for a walk (with my FFP3 mask and gloves, of course).
While I walked down one of the busiest roads, which would usually be filled with lawyers, bureaucrats, and policemen, I experienced what I thought I never would. The noise, horns and audible presence of humanity were replaced with the sound of nature. All I could hear was the distant chirping of birds, the buzzing of bees, a few squirrels fighting over food and the sound of leaves brushing against each other. It was unlike anything I’d experienced in this crowded town, ever. A mat of yellow Tabebuia flowers covered the road, and an eerie feeling of being alone started to creep in. I reached the main highway, which is one of the busiest in our country, only to find it empty and quiet.
It had turned into a ghost town.
People are afraid to come out, half of them are worried about getting beat up by the cops, and the rest are worried for their lives.
The evenings are quiet, almost like a spooky set from a movie. The thought of running out of supplies lingers around me, then I catch myself wondering if it’ll all get worse.
I worry for the pregnant woman who expects for her water to break any moment, for that old diabetic man who needs his insulin shots, or the child who needs to get that next Chemo session; I worry for that daily laborer with 5 mouths to feed, the student stuck 1000 miles away from home, and for her parents who anxiously wonder if she has eaten yet. I worry for that woman who just retired this year and wanted to spend the next chapter of her life in peace, only to be tested positive for COVID-19.
I worry for others too, and that is exactly what it feels like to be under lockdown. It’s worrying, harrowing and horrifying.",N/A,2,"Mar 27, 2020 6:25 am",misscrystal,2,"We are so incredibly out of balance with the earth. We do such destructive un natural things.

@darrendesign
,
Your wondering made me in a situation to think for an instance, we have some outer space people around here .
Jokes apart, appeciate your concern here.
Well, its not particularly i think that we(human race) are the best creations of god. This concept is said, in almost every religious books as far i know… Besides this is not a religios post rather a motivational post for those people suffering with COVID - 19 VIURS.
Moreover, i did not say or made any kind assurance that the entire human race is going to end up. I wrote,
We are the best creations of GOD & surely not created to end up like this.
I apologise that i was not able make myself clear enough here. I am not a fortune teller so no way i can declare such things…rather i was upset for 24000+ and still increasing number of lost souls throug out the world as of now, due to this Coronavirus. May their soul Rest In Peace.
Take care.",N/A,"Mar 26, 2020 9:56 pm",2020-07-29 18:32:49.857588

I totally agree with

Also, I wanted to add that you could take some Skill test, which will show your potential client how good you are in your work field.
And, when you work on description edit, try to make it SEO ready. Find good keyword for your GIG and make put that word/phrase in title, description, tag…
