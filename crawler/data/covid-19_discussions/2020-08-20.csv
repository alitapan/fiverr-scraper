Uh no. $55 is a steal for the quality of work she delivers. And you’re definitely paying for more than the graphic. Communication is , and the smoothest graphics orders I’ve had are with her. If anything, the prices should go up, not down.
Aside from that, I know a lot of places are canceling events, but churches are having to ramp up the graphics and content to compensate for the online services we’ll be doing until it’s safer to be in large gatherings. Plus, Easter is coming up. The Bible belt has been busy.

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

What do you think guys??",N/A,1,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",darrendesign,10,"Hi now is a very hard times for all of us and we should think in a way to help each others in this period many offices and businesses are stop working and there is very few people in a streets. And because of pandemic there isn’t much to do now it’s time to hold and rethink our actions, if you don’t have orders you can always sharpen your skills, I don’t like your sarcastic notice about fiverr’s answer, as fiverr do a lot to make this platform best possible place for all of us by promoting and attracting as many customers as it’s possible. So what we do with our work to support fiverr’s growth? I can’t understand people who think that fiverr owe them anything. Can I ask you why you don’t have buyers? Why you don’t make them return? You need to provide the best possible work to make them forget about other places, you must give them quality that they will not get in other places I’m not speaking about price believe me if you have money you will buy a Porsche rather than Fiat if you know what I mean so every customer ready to pay for a good product as they understand that with that they will look better and can success, every time lowering prices and giving even low quality product isn’t the way we should try to keep on fiverr. I recommend to read more and study better to become a better skilled in what you do every time you have a time this is the only way to attract more customers. In these days the whole world is fighting with unseen virus which is not a joke and because of massive isolation it’s very natural that everything will loose the grip and become more slow so imagine if every seller who have a drop on sales will message to fiverr and ask why they aren’t get as many orders as they want? I have printed flyers and hire 2 girls to share them with people I buy a places to make advertisements I go to different forums and workshops I meet people and tell about my business on fiverr I try to advertise as much as I can my gigs. I’m not a specialist in this maybe I do many wrong things but I try at least I don’t seat and ask fiverr to give me a buyers I have a buyers outside of fiverr I invite them I recommend them to use fiverr I’m an artist designer I never do marketing I don’t understand much and it costs me a lot of energy and I feel not comfortable doing that many things but I know that if each of us will try to do something which will help fiverr that will be only good for all of us. Sorry if I write anything wrong or anyhow you can think I offend in any case please don’t take this personal I just speak in general it’s about my feelings and thoughts which I follow, you can give me your opinion and I can learn from it much, thank you and stay safe we all should try to pass through this with understanding and compassion to each other stay safe",N/A,"Mar 27, 2020 6:47 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:21.286218

What do you think guys??",N/A,1,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,8,"First of all, Please accept my deepest condolence. Recently, Armenia reports first death related to coronavirus which is pretty sad
You’re right, If I’m not getting any orders then there is something wrong with me. Maybe my gigs, images, title, keywords & my skills are not not working for me. I will change them & improve my gigs & skills soon. But please note: I’m not bashing Fiverr here & I’m not complaining about not getting orders
I started this discussion to verify that if (COVID-19) is the reason for not getting any sales right now. And yes I was right. (This Coronavirus pandemic changed the world including Fiverr) Usually I receive 5-6 messages per day or sometimes 2-3 orders a day. But from last 26 days, No one is contacting me & no one is ordering my gigs which was pretty strange for me that’s why I started this.
Repeat customers are the reason of my survival on Fiverr. I’m a seller here for more than 6 years now so yeah I know what I’m doing here. I often advertise & promote my gigs on different platforms & yes on on my social media accounts as well. I even have a “Marketing budget” for my gigs. Yes, I usually invest my 20% earning on advertising which is essential for my online business. When I’ve started in 2014 the competition for me was not that strong. Yes “My Main Job was to speed up wordpress sites much faster” & that time no one was competing with me.
You can go to Fiverr & just search this: wordpress speed optimization (You will find 100+ gigs about speed optimization) Yeah exactly like the logo ones. Everyone is a expert in this field now I’m talking about wordpress speed optimization here.
2014 (When I was just 18-19 years old kid) 2020 (When I’m 24 right now & much for experienced & professional)
So yeah I improved a lot & yes even my personal life is changed now
I stopped working here for more than 2 years because of some personal reasons but when I started again in 2019 everything about this marketplace was changed. Fiverr PRO area, You can take skills & other tests. So I was happy that they’re improving this marketplace but then I activated the paused gigs & realized that no one is messaging me. I searched my gigs & found out that every other seller is offering my services, which was just shocking for me. I invested my time & money on my profile & then orders start coming again. I even messaged my previous buyers so they can know that I’m back here
Everything was normal that time then in January 2020 my impressions, views & clicks were decreasing every single day. (Strange) right!!
I contacted Fiverr support & they told me that everything is fine with your account but I still told them to check it again & they replied: Everything is normal but I can feel that everything was not normal that time. February was a pretty good month for me but then this March month destroyed everything
I can’t even express my feelings with you, I’m so sad & worried right now. & please don’t say sorry to me & yeah I don’t take anything personally so don’t worry

No no, Please try to understand that main purpose was to show the impact of the coronavirus on businesses.
To be honest, I am getting sick of people trying to remind me of the impact on businesses. I have a friend who secured the lease on a restaurant just before this. He was due to open in a few days, can’t, and is still contractually obliged to pay $1,200 rent each month for the next year.
I know a couple who own a shop who can’t open and are stuck in a similar boat with no income coming in.
I use a mobile grocer to buy my groceries who is now no longer able to do his rounds, and the last time he was here last week, there was a pretty depressed guy I know asking how many individual eggs he could buy with what change he had.
I live on a street of bar and restaurant workers, none of whom are going to be able to pay their rent very soon. Any who are foreign have also been told that if they do not have jobs or are not economically self sufficient, they will need to go back to their own countries by the government. - Despite the only airport being closed.
Now it seems like every time I come here, I have someone I do not know from Adam asking me to help them out, think of them, or do something to help fight Covid-19 by donating my time or skills for free to nondescript charitable causes.
I’m very sorry that you are experiencing hardship. However, like it or not, nobody here can help. It is really as simple as that and the worst thing you can do is continue going around in circles asking people to care or help. Instead, you need to figure out how to help yourself.
Sorry to be brutal, but that’s the way it is. .",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 3:49 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:27.776023

Please don’t misunderstand me, My main purpose was to show the impact of Coronavirus on businesses. That’s why I’m posting updates every single day.
I agree with Cyaxrex that I don’t want constant reminders of the virus’s impact on businesses. I do not want to stop coming here out of disgust.

I’m a reputed & experienced seller here & a member for more than 6 years now
I get that. Also, I am sincerely sorry that you are in a tight spot. However, to be very blunt, a lot of people are and things are only going to get worse. In this case, you need to start thinking outside the box.
People and businesses in your area will be struggling right now. Is it possible that you could help by reaching out to them directly and offering budget-friendly wen development,graphic design, or marketing services, even if you outsource some of these?
You would literally just have to send a letters to each one. (No one reads emails, but letters can still work.)
That is just one basic idea that may not be applicable to you at all, but you need to start looking for solutions like that yourself. You could also play ith your pricing a little. Lower the price of your most pricey web design gig, but increase the price of your $10 gigs.
Maybe also re-evaluate your delivery times. No offense, but I don’t believe you can build me a full, fully responsive website in 2-days. Maybe create a 1-day consultation gig or package, and increase delivery time on your web design gig to something like 5-days.
Whatever you do, good luck. However, you really do need to start with you doing something, rather than asking for people to share their excess orders with you. Quite frankly, most people likely don’t have excess orders to start with.",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 4:21 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:30.674715

It doesn’t matter. Fiverr doesn’t allow sellers contacting buyers after order is done. It takes only one person not to like it and that’s it, best she will get a warning, worst he will loose her account.
In a real world it would’ve been an ok practice however it’s forbidden on fiver. If you want to risk your account - that’s fine, but do not advise others potentially harmful things.

Actually many forum members & Fiverr staff members appreciated me but they also told me this: Don’t share any link here or anywhere on Fiverr.
Actually I respect them & that’s why I decided to stay quite until it’s done. Yes my (2 day launch) idea was bad because my friends told me that we can’t publish this huge site in just next few days. Yes, I decided to launch that campaign in next 15 days. Where me & you will help (NON-US Freelancers) in need.
I will advertise it on Google ads, Facebook & other social media channels. I don’t have enough budget right now but I can assure you that we will start this (Relief fund) even without any enough resources.
In next few months NON-US freelancer can create an account & start their own Unions. I will start my own Forum for freelancers & a Huge NON-US Freelancers Union website. 100 & 100 of pages, Forum, Support, Blog, Donate now & other things included.
What Fiverr team told me:
Greetings, you do not need to promote your site and post URL everywhere. talk about it, increase awareness of it and the need for such union. Anyone can build the website, but the whole point is not the traffic or number of members on the site but the act, will and sacrifice for other colleagues. Don’t ask to post the link but to start a topic and discussion to hear other freelancers, what they need the most, how do they feel and what each of you can contribute.

You really need to think on your execution. You are missing a lot of points. Let’s start with the Non-US. Which counties will that be? Do you realise that NON-US also includes Russia, China, South American countries, Australia and all European countries?
Secondly to operate like that you will need to register yourself with a government under a certain licence. Are you working on registering yourself as a charity? Otherwise your website will be nothing but a scam (even if you don’t think so). You can not register yourself as a sole trader otherwise you will have to pay tax on every donation you get as on normal income. If you are not planning to register yourself then again it will be illegal. + all the points that @jonbaas added.
It might be noble what you are thinking to do but it looks like you are not even realising what work will stand behind that and what will be the process of registering and running it.
Website is actually only a tool. You thought of how to make a tool but you didn’t think of how to build a “house”. E.g you need to build a house and instead of hiring an architect and designer and create plans of how your house will look like and workers to build it, you instead of that hired people to create a hammer because you think the hammer is what will build you a house.

In all honesty, what credentials do you have to offer that would make people trust YOU to be the organizer for this “freelance union”?

This is the very nature of anyone choosing to be an independent worker. Independence from any corporate banner, and a self-minded approach to offering services is, by nature, supposed to be a risk freelancers take. Smart freelancers plan for tough times. They don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Freelancers are not unionized, or a cooperative venture. Freelancers take on the responsibility to be their own business – to grow their dreams, and become what they want to become. To be successful, means to take on the risk of failure as well. Without the risk of failure, there can be no success.
I admire those who truly wish to help freelancers, but I just don’t think you’re going about it in a reasonable, strategic or cooperative way. A union begins as a group of like-minded tradesmen, it isn’t one person trying to collect money for dubious distribution. I just don’t feel as though you are thinking this all the way through.

Look, you already said that. That’s not what I asked you.
wpfalcon:
I’m not starting a charity organization
The it will be ILLIGAL for you to gather money and “redistribute” them. ILLIGAL. If you wouldn’t register yourself as charity it will be ILLIGAL for you to do what you are planning.
wpfalcon:
I’m talking about a Union
As a “union” you are not allowed to ask for money and donate them to someone else.
I guess you are not realising but there is a strict regulations around the world around the activity you are planning including your country.
WITHOUT REGISTERING YOURSELF UNDER CERTAIN LICENCE YOU WILL BE COMMITTING FRAUD. (you seem to ignore what we are saying so I’ll repeat: i even if you don’t think it’s fraud it will be considered fraud legally)
And I am not trying to discourage you, I am showing how many loopholes you have. That you didn’t even think through about the details. You don’t even want to register yourself. If you wish to continue and believe in it you will HAVE TO take all those steps that we explained to you (and I’m sure we are still missing quite a few important points because legally it’s not a fast and easy process)",N/A,"Apr 4, 2020 11:07 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:52.174610

It seems to me that you actually build up your plan here in this forum listening to what everybody says.
Just and idea, did you consider to hire professionals to set up such business? This may bring also initial trust level at least.
I am just worried that you want to play a game that may get out of your control soon.
Here’s a recent story from my country.
Our government wanted to spend $15 Mio for e-shop with freeways vignettes.
Web developers community said this amount is ridiculous and offered to make it for 10% of that money.
So they collected 40 specialists to develop and build up the site during weekend hackaton.
This group was so eager to show that they can do it in short time for friction of that money and finally they almost did it.
I say almost because just a few hours later after website was live, the site was broken with loss of personal data, cc data and more. Those were professionals but lack of time and proper planning meant failing.
Just be very careful when you think that you have solution for this and that. Are you really sure about it?

What do you think guys??",N/A,1,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,4,"I’m planning this for months now. Yes when (COVID-19) pandemic was not even started. I’m just asking & looking for suggestions here.
Yes I have a small team & I’m also in contact with many professionals. I even sent many e-mails to different organizations who are working for Independent workers or Freelancers. I want their suggestions, advice & ideas. I’m just a normal person like you so yes I will face many challenges for sure.
Note: Freelancers Union is also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.
Some FAQs: (Let’s talk Legal)
So you will register this (Organization) as a Trade Union?
Maybe. Right now I’m just checking every single aspect because even the official (Freelancers Union) is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers). So they’re just a non-profit organization.
So you will register this as a Non-profit organization?
In my country, you can register a (Non-profit organization or NGO/NPO) in three ways. Trust Registration, Society Registration, Section 8 Company Registration (Earlier known as Section 25 Company)
The type of registration you will need depends on the purpose you want to achieve.
Please note that Society and Trust registration is different from business registration. This is because societies, trusts, and NGOS have charitable objectives. On the other hand, a business works only for profit. Therefore, separate laws govern Society and Trust registration. The only exception is a Section 8 company which is governed by the Companies Act, 2013. These entities receive some special tax exemptions and benefits. These benefits are not available to commercial business setups.
Do you have any business plan?
Yes I have a plan so I can achieve my goals. I’m doing my research right now so I can start this (UNION or Organization) so please make sure that If I start this UNION or NGO/NPO someday then I do have a business plan for it.
Do you have any legal team?
Yes I have a legal team so if I needed any kind of registration then I will contact them for sure. I will pay some huge amount for the registration. Also in case of emergencies the legal representative will help me.
Why Should I Trust You?
I’m just a normal freelancer like you. Recently I started this topic when my sales were dropped dramatically. Everything is normal now, But from that day I decided to do something for my community. Yes, Not just planning or thinking but to execute it properly. I don’t want to waste my time on such questions where people were asking me If I’m doing this for any personal gain. I want to help this community & the Freelancers. Specially the NON-US Freelancers. That’s why I’m planning it & I will execute it for sure.
Maybe not today, Next week or Next month but in next few years. So literally no one can stop me right now. I still remember a reply where someone told me that legal things take time so yeah I will wait until it’s done. I want an organization for (NON-US Freelancers) so I’ll try my best to be 100% legal. Otherwise I will not start this anytime soon.
Why you’re wasting your precious time on such Organization?
I just want to help this community, That’s all I want. Maybe someday we have a Union for NON-US Freelancers & I’m sure everyone wants it so we can help each other
What about funding?
Right now I will spend my own money because I want to start a small organization but yes when our (Organization) will get popular then we will find our supporters. Right now the official (Freelancers Union) has received grants and other support from leading foundations such as the Ford Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, New York Community Trust, United Hospital Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, New York State Health Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, Partnership Fund for New York City, Ira W. De Camp Foundation and others.

Things have definitely slowed down in comparison to the last few months and I can only assume it is because of the on-going global pandemic. Try not to stress too much and in the meantime, use this as an opportunity to strengthen and refine your existing brand/image on Fiverr or use it to build a brand new gig altogether.
There is always an opportunity to thrive during times like this but the challenge now is that you need to be extra creative and strategic about your branding, services, customer experience, etc. This is what’s going to set you apart from your competition when the volume of orders is at a low point.
A few key areas that I would personally focus on, if you haven’t already would be: Creating unique and engaging gig images or videos, writing clear and concise gig descriptions, and improving/adding to your existing skillset.
I hope this helps someone!
Best of luck to everyone and remember to be safe,

That is incorrect. This topic has been VIEWED 1.6k times. That’s total views, not users. Most of those views are likely from the same people 50 who have posted something in this topic, and participated since you started it on March 14.
As I have noted before, I applaud your desire to help people, however, this topic is not as popular and wide-reaching as you think.

That’s a funny one you played on Fiverr customer support.
Anyways, even though I believe the Covid-19 posed a serious challenge to the US economy, I still believe their system is quite insulated to a reasonable extent. Most still use ■■■■■, teams, and the likes to further their engagements, hence their need for Fiverr digital services.
You may want to follow the advice of the Customer support, and perhaps, take a few tests to boost your competence in the face of customers.
I wish you all the best✌

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

But yes I’m getting orders now & I hope you guys will receive orders soon. Sorry if I didn’t like your post or if I didn’t read it or if I didn’t replied but I’m trying my best.
Once again, Thanks for all the support. You guys are like my family & I genuinely appreciated every single reply.

I finished high school last year and I know how to develop websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am really good at it and I thought this year was my time to put my skills into use.
All over sudden while I was still doing the national examinations, COVID-19 bumped in. My brother is a professional freelance but he started freelancing a decade ago. He told me the challenges I am getting now may be the impacts of COVID-19.
This various came with many negative impacts. Other than killing people it is also killing the economy. Countries like USA that are know to outsource their jobs to third world countries like where I am from are also struggling to secure jobs for themselves. Hopefully all will be well soon.

It is affecting and will be affecting a lot of businesses and areas. Already a lot of markets are affected including oil and gas and even manufacturing and phones, TV etc potentially might have higher prices in the next year or so. The impacts are going to be way dipper and extend and after the virus epidemia is done.
I live in one of the countries with highest numbers of sick people but this government handled situation amazingly fast and doing everything to stop the spread. They found all contacts of sick people (which are more than 2000 people that they found and quarantined as a prevention even without symptoms), closed borders (which a lot of people doesn’t like), made it a CRIMINAL offence to withhold information about your whereabouts and your health condition. Your visas will be revoked and you will be deported from the country if you breached home quarantine. Government will pay all your medical bills if you get sick and if you are in official quarantine you will be compensated 100$ for each day.
But there is no point to panic because of this and just to take normal precautions which should’ve been common sense by now, not to sneeze and cough with open mouth, do not spit on the streets, wash your hands and don’t touch your face.

I’m pretty chilled with government having info on me and spying and putting this preventive measures. I’m all for it if it’s going to protect me. But yes, they are temporary.
However it does make sense to make it a criminal offence if you look from a different angle: in South Korea there is an old aunty that got sick a lot of people going to church and buffets every day, she knew she had symptoms, she visited a doctor and doctor explicitly asked her to make a test because he suspect a virus, she refused. And even after she knew that she might have virus she still went to church and drunk from the same cup with everyone else.
So I’m a way if she got someone knowingly sick and someone would die from it, it is indirect murder. Which is a criminal offence.",N/A,"Feb 27, 2020 10:09 pm",2020-08-20 18:52:58.518846

Not entirely correct. Depending on the mask. An N95 disposable mask (or P2 / P3 for European equivilant) do offer a form of protection, but health officials are cautious to recommend them because most people won’t use them properly (fitted flush to the face properly at each use) and they’re not designed for more than short term use. They’re also a little expensive.
A regular surgical mask does give some degree but the main reason is that is helps protect people when touching their face/mouth (which they do some 23-40 times an hour) - Wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission, if nominally, as long as you’re practicing good hand hygeine as well.
As you rightly said, The other benefit is that they also help reduce a person who is infected spreading it further theoretically.

Do we have any information about what caused COVID-19?

Yes eating bats in a certain Asian country. Apparently they have the virus and it was able to transfer to people.
Bats are one theory, and not an overly realistic one, if you’re following the details of current events (as well as the constantly-changing propaganda coming out of a certain Asian country). Other people seem to present a rather strong case for a more intentional source of the virus – developed in a lab (in the same city the virus was first reported in), and accidentally released into the population.
The fact that the certain Asian country is now trying to blame the USA military as the source of the virus also tends to lend support for the second source story – the laboratory source.
Until that certain Asian nation actually releases factual data, however, no one will know for certain where, and how the virus actually got its start.",N/A,"Mar 13, 2020 11:37 pm",2020-08-20 18:53:36.339822

Bats are one theory, and not an overly realistic one,
The bats were being eaten raw. Raw food is dangerous unless it comes from a reputable source. Also, there was a virus caused by bats defecating on top of food that was being shipped out, I think it was bird flu, not sure.

I bet that cancellation will hurt your order completion rate.
My stats are all 100% but then there are all kinds of invisible metrics we don’t know about.
The entire situation opens endless possibilities for buyers to demand refunds over actual or pretend event cancellations, though. But this is something I’d rather not think about.
If I get any more orders for event promos, I’ll probably be putting together a short disclaimer to please keep checking if an event is still a go and that no refund will be possible if the event is canceled after the delivery. Then watch me get reported for being greedy and heartless in the face of a pandemic

Regular",5,"Throwing in my two cents: Correlation ≠ causation. It’s not the virus itself, it’s the the consequences of fear caused by the virus.
This actually boosts certain types of industries, such as suppliers of emergency goods, while it affects others negatively because consumers are diverting their available funds to those goods, from things of lesser relative importance.
One of my favorite quotes:
Just because you see a turkey flying in a tornado doesn’t mean turkeys can fly.
In other words: just because you’re doing well when there’s a good economy, doesn’t mean you’ll keep doing well if what you offer isn’t a critical-to-survival good/service. I’ll admit I’m exaggerating, but the point stands; people are going to prioritize. This was witnessed during the American Great Depression, and is witnessed any time a noticeable recession occurs in any established economy. Nowadays, being global and digital only means the effects are even more noticed by those who rely on being a global economy like many on Fiverr.
Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.
Many people seem confused by this event, but it’s not a new phenomena. (Remember the H1N1?) Yes, there will be victims (the flu still has more deaths-per-year, thus far). Yes, this is something to be attentive to (though you’d have to be rather socially-starved to be completely out-of-the-loop). Yes, it’s cause to take a few extra steps to be a bit more safe (if an individual isn’t already practicing good hygiene). But this IS. NOT. NEW.
The cancellation of events are for the sake of protecting people from themselves, because people will rationalize that going to a massive gathering is more important than their health AND the health of the people around them. (Like some people rationalize that answering a text is more important than focusing on the road. It doesn’t matter how often ‘nothing’ happens, it only takes one time for disaster to occur.)
I should probably get off the soapbox, though. Not sure how I ended up on it, actually. I was only going to make a short comment.",N/A,"Mar 14, 2020 12:35 pm",2020-08-20 18:53:43.506180

Interesting topic. Too early to say. If it goes full pandemic, I can see major disruptions in industries that rely on supply chains, the travel industry, food and retail, and other businesses. Schools and Governments too. That could shift people to work from home or to rely on outsourcing or slow it all down for everyone touched by this.

There are people here who need their Fiverr earnings to buy food for themselves and their family, to pay their health insurance, rent and other necessities, and of course, they are worried now, especially if they see a drop in their orders and want to find out if everyone isn’t getting orders anymore either, what they do or plan to do if it is so and continues, and so on.
This is the conversations category, if you hover it in the category lists, you’ll find that it says that it’s a catch-all for any discussions that don’t fit anywhere else and for non-Fiverr related discussions and “anything else that doesn’t break the forum rules or other community guidelines”.",N/A,"Mar 15, 2020 10:13 am",2020-08-20 18:53:56.332643

People actually need to go to work and have projects in order to give us work so this will definitely affect us freelancers and it might get worse as more strict protocols and longer shutdowns are in place.

Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))!

I’m curious how much money (per mile) do Uber/Lyft drivers make today? I use to keep up with a few drivers on YT but it’s been a longtime.
What Uber pays per mile depends on where you are in the USA or in the world. In South Florida, we get $0.62 per mile, $0.12 per minute. I think taxi drivers make $1.25 per mile, $0.25 per minute. Uber drivers make more when they drive luxury vehicles, huge minivans, etc. If there are no surges (extra money for increased demand), I will filter towards long rides, and reject short rides (as long as Uber lets me, they can disable that function if you reject too many rides). If there is a surge, I will drive towards it (if it’s close) and go online and accept the first ride I get.
A fellow driver tells me his goal is making $100 in 5 hours. Sometimes that’s possible, other time it’s not. On average, I make $12 to $15 an hour. It’s a job that requires patience because the first hour might be horrible, but on the next hour you might get great surges.",N/A,"Mar 16, 2020 2:30 am",2020-08-20 18:54:01.494705

The economy as a whole of course takes a massive hit but people still spend money, just not as much and partly on different things, and more on certain things.
There will be demand for new things/services or more of some already existing things/services, while the world tries to adapt and keep functioning.
Whether someone has work or not, now highly depends on what exactly one does, and if there are alternatives. Here , for example, people who work in restaurants which are empty or closed, are being suggested they could work in farming, as the workers from abroad will be missing, when borders are and stay closed for a while.

Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))!

A fellow driver tells me his goal is making $100 in 5 hours. Sometimes that’s possible, other time it’s not. On average, I make $12 to $15 an hour. It’s a job that requires patience because the first hour might be horrible, but on the next hour you might get great surges.

After the 2008 financial crisis, this happened in Greece with massive self-death increases (can’t say the S word), and spikes in bygone diseases like Malaria:
Malaria has returned to Greece as financial cuts contribute to the re-emergence of a once extinct disease. … Other mosquito-borne diseases that have slipped back into Greece include West Nile virus. Statistics show that there were 70 instances of mosquito borne diseases in Greece in the first nine months of the year.

I’m 23 and I am Quarantining. It’s not an over reaction.
People your age are unlikely to catch covid. Also, most people aren’t self-isolating, Home Depot and local supermarkets have been as busy as ever. In fact, I think some folks are using this opportunity to work on construction projects, gardening, etc.
blavaro:
Furthermore self-quarantine is mainly supposed to stop spreading the infection.
We’ll see if it works. I know kids on Spring Break have been going to the beach even though the governor of Florida closed the beaches. How do you enforce that? Do you put a cop on every beach? It’s very impractical. In California, they expect people to snitch on lawbreakers, good luck with that. Most people mind their own business unless a crime is commited against them.
Besides, how long do you think people can live like this? Who wants to live a life without restaurants, movie theaters, etc? Who wants to cook every meal at home and overpay for toilet paper on eBay?
People talk about the sacrifices civilians made during WW2, but that was different, and those civilians still had access to movies and other entertainments. It was gas that was rationed, people grew victory gardens, and lived with a lot less. Ironically, there was still a black market, people selling counterfeit gas cards, etc.
Now things are pretty crazy. I read that in New Jersey a family got arrested for inviting more than 50 people to a wedding at home.
On the other hand, in Philadelphia they are delaying arrests of those who “commit certain non-violent offenses.” So if someone wants to burglarize homes in Philly, this is the perfect time to do it.
“Due to the confirmed case of #COVID19 from community spread, Salt Lake City Police Department is asking all criminal activities/nefarious behavior to cease until further notice,” the Utah capital’s law enforcement wrote in a tweet. “We appreciate your anticipated cooperation in halting crime & thank criminals in advance.”

This is because the USA is actively and widely testing. There may have been only 40 KNOWN cases, but that doesn’t mean there couldn’t have already been many more at that time.
22,000 cases seems like a large number, however, in a nation of 330 million people, that’s only 0.00006% of the total population, and most of those infected right now have minor/moderate cases that do not require hospitalization.

fastcopywriter:
Is it fair to shut down society for the one fifth that are in danger?
It sounds like you can’t grasp the gravity of the situation.
No one has immunity to this disease and it’s impossible to determine who will be able to throw it off like a case of the flu, and who will become more sick.
We now have a U.S. senator who tested positive, and a governor as I recall. Look at what happened to Italy. We unfortunately can expect that here, no reason to believe otherwise. By shutting things down we might be able to “flatten the curve” meaning not have as high a spike before cases start to go down. It’s our best hope.
So far we are a long way from the time when cases will start to go down. I wish everyone could realize the importance of at least keeping a distance between themselves and others, and frequent hand washing.
It’s not just about each of us trying to not get sick. It’s about having it without any symptoms, and going around where others are and spreading it to them. So even if you don’t have symptoms you may put others into danger by coming into close proximity to them. This is a common way people get it.
I want to offer a bit of hope as well as this gloomy report:

Yes, in my opinion. Human life and health has no price. Economy will take a hit, eventually recover, but some people that catch this virus will unfortunately not share the same fate.
And yet Italy is denying respirators to people over 60. See? Human life has a price, and when the government controls your healthcare, they decide who lives and who dies, who’s valuable and who has been alive too long for them to care.

No one has immunity to this disease and it’s impossible to determine who will be able to throw it off like a case of the flu, and who will become more sick.
My point is not everyone is susceptible to this disease, not everyone catches it. Right now Home Depot (and other retailers I assume) instituted a rule where the store can’t have more than 100 people inside, including employees. So you can imagine the long lines of people waiting to get in. Ironically, there’s not much social isolation when you’re standing in line, so the measures are futile.
I do hope remdesivir works, I can’t wait to go back to normal. I hope we never again shut down society over a disease.
blavaro:
It is pity that in our country people still think so selfish these days.
Selfishness is the natural state of people. Altruism and self-sacrifice are aberrations. When someone orders for me, it’s for selfish reasons, same reason I serve my customers well. Altruism would require me to refund every order and tell my client, “I love you so much, that I want to work for you for free.” That I’ll never do, I might give my clients extras to keep him coming back, see? Selfish reasons, but I wont’ sacrifice my time and my money for anyone. If anyone gets a refund, that person is blocked and reported to Fiverr.

But the other day in the supermarket, a woman who was dutifully wearing a mask tried to stand so close behind me she was practically breathing down my neck (and no, it wasn’t for the lack of space, there was plenty of room behind her).
Today a customer at Home Depot tried to shake my hand, I declined politely. I see lots of people fist bumping, and one person elbow bumping which I suppose it’s safe. Some customers also get very close to me when they have a question. Staying 2 meters away from people is unrealistic.

That’s not right. That’s like waiting two years for a kidney, undergoing dialysis three times a week, and when a kidney is finally available, they give it to a celebrity.
If I show up to the hospital first, I’m supposed to be treated first. What kind of sickos choose who gets to live and who gets to die? If someone dies because all respirators were taken, that’s sad, but at least that person didn’t die because someone deemed him or her unworthy.
Older people are worthy. They have families, they’ve paid taxes their entire lives, some of them fought in WW2, they should be honored instead of being sentenced to death by giving that respirator to another patient.

Companies should embrace remote work permanently.
When they do that, they might as well embrace hiring freelancers instead of employees. Then it will become a case of companies constantly looking to reduce wage bills by hiring offshore workers.
Then there is the cybersecurity side of things. Then there is the slight problem that when you work from home you degenerate into an overweight blob that lives in less and less underwear every day and panics every time the doorbell rings…
Personally, I’ve regretted freelancing for quite a few years now, as I miss the sociability side of things.

Nor did we really know how it would affect the rest of the world or Gig economy workers. Sitting here on March 25th, Sh&T got real! More than 1/3 of the US population is under stay at home orders. It does not mean that everyone is listening. NY is the epicenter of this in the US for now, cases and deaths are rising at record rates each day countrywide - but mainly NY. A sign of things to come in other states is what many seem to wonder. We are still, although better at testing, need more tests to get a read on the entire picture and testing is backlogged, so I do not believe we have the full picture of how this is spreading in places outside of the major epicenters here.
The daily briefings by Governers, especially Cuomo of NY, and that of our commander in Chief are fascinating and taking the place of sporting events I would be watching for entertainment. I will leave that alone for now.
Good news for self-employed Gig workers who are affected by this. Sounds. like they can file for unemployment and get that plus some via this new bailout bill from congress.
The school system I work in just announced closure for 4 more weeks with remote learning. It should be interesting to see how they implement that.
Amazing how things change in just one short month. It went from we are scared and watching and maybe it won’t be so bad to oh Sh&t!

Gig workers, freelancers, self-employed are eligible
In an unprecedented move, the stimulus bill expands unemployment protections to gig workers, freelancers and self-employed individuals, who typically don’t qualify for unemployment benefits.
Seth Harris, former Deputy U.S. Secretary of Labor, describes this aspect of the stimulus package as a “gigantic change,” but notes that it could be complicated to execute.
“It will be harder [to calculate] because these workers don’t have a W-2 or an average weekly wage,” Harris says. “These folks have income that varies dramatically from week to week or month to month.”
It’s not clear yet how state benefits will be calculated for these workers (from forbes)",N/A,"Mar 25, 2020 7:29 pm",2020-08-20 18:54:47.894717

Greetings! Hope you all are well. I’m here since 2017. Day by day the performance is going well.
But is this year a caution for me? Why?
Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))! Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos. Though other photo types are going well.

22,000 cases seems like a large number, however, in a nation of 330 million people, that’s only 0.00006% of the total population, and most of those infected right now have minor/moderate cases that do not require hospitalization.

they don’t do anything at all to help me, just like with the usual experiences I’ve had with doctors
Most of my experiences with doctors are positive. If I have a problem, they fix it, either in the office or they give me a prescription. A family member of mine is in the hospital with corona, they have helped him and he’s gotten much better. In a day or two, he’ll leave the hospital, there’s even a service that will drive him so nobody else gets infected.

This doesn’t kill like the Spanish flu of 1918. In fact, a 101-year-old patient in Italy, whose grandmother survived the Spanish flu, has fully recuperated from corona. A relative of mine was also in the hospital, and he didn’t even need a respirator, his breathing was bad but not bad enough.

Wow, glad he’s getting better. I wonder if he would have been better on his own. Did he have breathing problems? Did you have contact with him?
Only once three or four weeks ago, I lost track of time since the quarantine began. I don’t think he would have gotten better on his own, the reason he’s in the hospital is because his fever and breathing got a lot worse, and he was feeling really bad. He’s 67, so he’s definitely part of the main demographic for corona.
I’m honestly more concerned about my job. Every time I go to the break room, I’m sitting in places that might have corona. If I push a supermarket cart, that might have corona. I do wear gloves, but what if the inside of the gloves already have corona? This virus is so evil, the way it can lasts for hours on a surface.",N/A,"Mar 27, 2020 9:56 pm",2020-08-20 18:54:53.391088

Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))!

Now, as far as the Sims 4 goes do you recommend it and why? Try to convince me to play hehehe.
Yes, I definitely recommend it. Why? Because you can control the lives, adventures, careers, families, and stories of digital sims. Your sims can interact with vampires, learn magic, become a college student, have pets, raise children, travel to another planet, and much more. Plus, you can build just about any kind of building, fill it with a wide assortment of furniture and possessions, reshape entire neighborhoods, kill your sim, bring them back to life, visit ancient places… the list goes on.
I especially enjoy the extensive “create-a-sim” feature. It has been a wonderful distraction to the challenges of a hard day. Or, just a great way to have fun and lose track of time.

Self isolating, avoiding the outside world best I can. Stocked up pretty well but just carrying on with work here. My cat and I are quite comfortable.
The biggest “concern” I’ve had with my Fiverr orders right now is the prospect of cancellation requests popping up.
Money may have changed for some people / businesses. What was once a priority is perhaps not so much right now whilst this thing goes on.
I have this uncertainty about orders in my queue - Will I get a message from a customer out of no where asking to cancel because of their money woes or because the business side of things is on hold? Will I get several? Should I jump on the orders sooner rather than later or chill out a bit…
It creates a bit of unease for me, doubly so because of the way Fiverr handles cancellations now and obviously because income for a lot of freelancers is volatile currently (more than normal).

What an interesting time we are in as a global economy. In my neck of the woods on the east coast beaches are closed, stores readily running out of supplies, business are shutting down everyday, police are breaking up beach parties, others getting on social media telling their friends to dine out.
Not much of a spread yet but a well know aerospace facility in my town just got a case of covid-19 and havent shut down. That facility employees hundreds of engineers. I live next door to an Airbnb for outatowners only. I don’t understand why people are traveling out of state/country right now. I’m afraid many are not taking this virus seriously.
In terms of Fiverr, it’s slowed down a bit but steady. I’m thankful we have the opportunity to work safely from home. THANK YOU Micha and the Fiverr team for building this place for us!!

I would like the community to come together and arrange for me and my dog and possibly my girlfriend to be airlifted immediately to Pitcairn Island.
Thank you for the kind offer.
More seriously, I’d really like Fiverr to maybe go with @eoinfinnegan’s earlier suggestion of Fiverr relaxing St. Levels and maybe putting some UI tweaks in place to make sellers’ lives easier.
I’ve been bombed bya client repeatedly ordering in bulk from my single article gig with 1-day delivery, despite me asking him numerous times to message me before placing bulk orders. I’ve finally lost it and just canceled his last order. However, my stats will likely be ruined soon anyway.
The thing is, this wouldn’t happen if we had a feature to limit how many of a certain gig package a single buyer can buy at a time.
Another thing that would make life easier is a 24-hour or 48-hour auto-accept feature for disputes. I got bombed yesterday with lots of people who aren’t replying to extension requests, likely because it is the weekend and they are doing what normies do and are taking time out until Monday.
And would it really be so hard to darken and increase the font size of the fonts in messages, order requirements, and custom offers? - Or let sellers customize this?",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 5:53 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:55.108135

Another thing that would make life easier is a 24-hour or 48-hour auto-accept feature for disputes. I got bombed yesterday with lots of people who aren’t replying to extension requests, likely because it is the weekend and they are doing what normies do and are taking time out until Monday.
This! Even a 3/4 day long or something would be better than the current Buyers can just disappear situation. I have a $550 order with a client who has disappeared for two weeks after we had extended the delivery a couple of times (order placed over 2 months ago) while waiting for them for other reasons. There is still some parts of the order to complete which she has said she wants to give input to but hasn’t done so meaning I can’t just push ahead with it.
Meanwhile, it looks like I have an order which is 16 days late and technically the client could cancel it and get refunded at any point as I can’t do an extension without her agreement…",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 8:18 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:56.318763

I come from Italy. As you may have already heard, here the situation is truly tragic, especially in Northern Italy. We’ve been in quarantine for 13 days, all non-essential services are closed, and the military and police officers monitor the cities. Many have lost their jobs and self-employed workers are the ones who are suffering a severe blow, economically speaking. Fortunately, I am doing fine. The company I work for allows smart-working and when I don’t work, I have online lessons and dedicate myself to freelancing ( well, and Netflix too). I’ve noticed that several other companies are demanding for people to work remotely. I imagine that in this tragic scenario the world of work gets adapted to the circumstances and I think this is positive for those who now find it difficult to raise some money.
Either way, I hope you are all fine. Wherever you come from, try to stay safe!",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 8:48 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:57.082599

This is getting ridiculous if I’m honest.
On my island, we have had no cases but 1 that was sent to the mainland. The only way to get here is by ferry. All businesses are closed and already people are losing their jobs and can’t pay their bills. It would be easy to prohibit passengers on the ferry and just use the service for goods. This way, life here could continue as something like normal and small businesses would at least stand a chance.
Instead, tourists can get a 10,000 euro fine for not answering the door when a policeman calls to see if they are obeying by quarantine rules. (This means they press buzzers on apartment main entrances that usually don’t work, and guess what time they call?) Businesses can also get a 3,000 fine for opening and at least one has already been fined for trying to do something productive and having staff on-site doing paintwork and maintenance.
It is all madness.
And if you thought Coronavirus was bad, wait for rat flu!

Man who died on bus in China tests positive for virus RATS spread
The victim died on a vehicle in Shandong as he made his way to work and was found to be suffering from hantavirus, which infected rats spread through bites, droppings, urine and saliva.
Then you have that minor problem that is when economies nosedive, public health goes through the floor. Infant mortality rates go up, life expectancy shortens, violent crime goes up, the rate of people choosing to end it all skyrockets, rates of malnutrition go up, disease spreads more easily as a result, homelessness rates skyrocket…

I can’t imagine what our pitiful little local emergency waiting room must be like, parents with screaming babies waiting for hours, homeless people, all sick and coughing, overworked understaffed nurses. Hope I don’t have to find out, in person.
A small ray of hope:
They found the virus doesn’t like hot humid weather, over 63 degrees f. It slows it down.
They also found it does not mutate due to the way it’s put together, unlike the flu, so any vaccine will likely be permanent.
Best hope: a year from now a good vaccine will be available to anyone. And the drug that shows so much promise is widely available to anyone who needs it.

We’ve been told that the hospitals have the test but don’t want to use them unless they absolutely have no choice.
In fact, from what I’m hearing, the hospitals are turning people away and not testing those even with outward symptoms of this disease. They just tell them to quarantine themselves and wait for 14 days unless they get worse.

And now I see how many people willing to help and take care about others and keep the rules. This is war and we are fighting with unseen enemy with whole world together this is very unique times we are leaving when you can win the enemy just doing nothing staying at home and keeping all the sanitarian rules when you need to go out. Covid-19 if we can take a look from the other side make us stronger and united we are all human beings no matter where you leave and what is your color we are all humans and this is a good time to stay at home and think about what we do wrong and why we do this with our earth and how we can change. Believe me we can if we stay united there is no need for any disease to make us take care more about our earth I hope this period of time will teach us to be more sensitive about what we do and if everything we are doing is good and brings happiness to others be more kind and compassive to others and nature. Don’t wait just do it make the world better today. I study how to make a medical masks from youtube and make 10-15 masks everyday and after share with old people for free also I try to help my neighbors who leave alone and higher than 60 to keep them stay home. I buy products and leave in the front of doors disinfecting with an alcohol the plastic bags first. I have no time to watch movies and read books which I love I just spend my time designing my route and planing the deliveries.

I have food delivered to my home. I only touch the bags with rubber gloves on and I wash all of it. I leave the bags of canned foods without touching them for three days. It can take that long for the virus to die when it’s on bags or other surfaces.
There may come a time when I can no longer get food delivered and I’m sure most people here still need to go out to get food. Please wear a mask or cloth over your nose and mouth when you go out.

We have no working plumbing currently in our ancient house and I’m afraid to let in anyone to fix it since our area is a very high covid area and I don’t want to be around any strangers.
Yesterday we had a complete blackout for a while. Between no plumbing and no lights or electricity it was surreal. At least in a cave we could build a fire and use the outside “restroom”.
I found myself yelling out the front door to the neighbors to find out what was happening with the electricity. We aren’t supposed to go outside at all here. I felt like a trapped animal.

To say I’m nervous about how this will all play out is an understatement. As much as I want to get back into the gym or lift weights in the local park, another part of me is saying, this is going to get worse before it gets better.
Last night, instead of attending a concert in Memphis to see Motionless in White, I was at home. The concert was postponed (understandable) and who knows if the concert will even happen. The bright spot of the whole thing is that my school will remain shut down for the rest of the academic year. Now, I do need to go in once a week to get things done such as auditing for next year and payments.
As it stands now, my job is being terminated due to restructuring. I was actually called to ask if I wanted another position in the school as a parapro. While it’s not what I want all the way around, I know I can do the job and will do it as I do anything else in my life. I await the final decision from the board to see if they will make the approval. So, we’ll see!
Thankfully, the Fiverr work has increased, which may be due in part to finding my best gig on page one again with the culmination of an ad I ran.
In the grand scheme of things, I’m just playing the wait and see game and doing work when it comes in.

Since I do reports all the time at work I find it natural to make a report on what I did during quarantine since this is the last Q-day in my country (Croatia). Starting tomorrow business should be slowly returning to normal.
So:
I published 2 new books
I wrote 3 new books and prepared drafts for 12 more
I wrote 5 e-books for students struggling to learn online since schools are closed
I started Fiverr seller account and earned 92 USD
I designed furniture for my backyard and build it together with my crafty neighbor
I repurposed frame of the old trampoline into the gym area
I planted some flowers for the first time in my life
I draw a big “NO SMOKING” sign in my backyard
I started a YouTube channel and helped a kid who was being harassed by others on the live stream
And
I cleaned and organized my office (this lasted for one day and now it is back to random mess)
I discovered there is nothing wrong with my car battery, for some reason car wants to start only if the shift gear is in a certain position
I gain 10 pounds (and then I decided to make gym outside :D)
I actually planted seeds of watermelon next to flowers.

Thank you for the Mexico part. I wish. Then I would know Spanish, my dream language.
I feel sorry for my old self. I had this backyard for 39 years and my day was wake up, go to university, do lectures for 8 hours, then do e-learning for 6 hours, and go to sleep, tomorrow, repeat. Never break, never rest, and the worst part is - nothing, I have nothing from 14 years of that, I worked to buy food and pay bills, the moment I save some money the prices go 30% up. Over and over. All the years of life wasted. I never wanted to invest in the apartment and backyard since it is rented, not mine. I finally got to my senses I need to enjoy in today.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/0/4/e/04e4b0779d0e9a6b38c26c5f727920ee25e3d16d.jpeg,"May 16, 2020 2:53 am",2020-08-20 18:58:23.099233

I’m sorry for your sisters situation. However, she might be lucky if France is still treating oncology patients. In Malta and lots of other countries, most cancer screening and treatment is pretty much on hold at the moment. I have a friend with lung cancer who hasn’t been to the hospital in weeks.

COVID19 is not so dangerous as cancer.
More people have died in building accidents on Malta this year than they have of COVID. However, the constriction industry is the only industry that has been allowed to continue operating as normal throughout the pandemic. Apparently, the cost to the economy would be to great if they ceased operations.
Then you have the suicide rate in the U.S. In some states, they have already recorded more suicides this year than during the entirety on 2019. Sadly, most people aren’t interested in looking at the bigger picture.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business.

As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

I’m not saying Fiverr owes us anything because of Corona – not at all.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

Actually, there is something Fiverr could do to help its seller freelancer community in a direct and probably not too complicated way (a bit of coding and sending out automated emails, I think).
As it’s possible that some of us may have to apply for government funds or a mortgage respite, prove to their health insurance that they don’t earn much or at all due to this pandemic to not have to keep paying their monthly dues based on last year’s earnings/tax declaration, etc.,
a “paper” (email) from Fiverr stating the seller’s revenue for any given month could be more helpful and get less suspicious looks than that csv file one can download. Staff in such organisations often don’t know much if anything about freelancing or at least platforms like Fiverr/the gig economy, too, and often ask for “something official”.
Something that looks credible and official, with Fiverr’s address and such, that states something like:
XY is registered on our platform as a freelancer and earned $$$ revenue in (February 2020).
I’m sure Fiverr has people who can make sure that that “revenue statement” will be fine from a legal standpoint for Fiverr.
This has been already suggested before COVID-19, as something like that, especially as a yearly statement, would be really useful for tax and other purposes, but I think in the face of the current situation, it might just have become even more relevant.
I hope this can be considered/passed on to the relevant people. Thanks!",N/A,"Mar 20, 2020 12:39 pm",2020-08-20 18:59:32.808840

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 377. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?

As for the specific question of ‘good plan B’, I can say that there has been a huge influx of people thinking the exact same thing. It all depends on if the plan was/is actually a plan and not a whim.
You’ve been here since December, according to your account, so you already know that it’s not as simple as making a gig to make sales. The ‘conditions’ are even more saturated now. Plan B might still work, but it’ll take work, a lot of work, to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.

Much of the work can be completed online and not in person.
I have an active account on Fiverr. I have seen a 30% increase in my business during the crisis. People have gone home and now they have time to complete the things they have been too busy to finish. They are less distracted now.
There is economic unrest which will keep some people from paying their bills. You and I just need a small percentage of work from the people who can spend.
The pest control business also suffers during times like this. It’s easy to hold on to cash and be 30 or 60 days behind on paying the pest control bill.

Two former co-workers of mine have died from COVID. One was 33 and died in a week after starting to exhibit symptoms. Another one was 41 and died in around a month. We weren’t close and haven’t talked in years.
I believe there is a penalty of roughly $1500 for not wearing a mask in a “public place” where I live. People don’t seem to care, everyone just carries a mask in their pocket or under their jaw to quickly put it on if the police come.
My inner circle is pretty small and I don’t leave the house much.

Personally I think it’s always a good idea to wear a mask whenever a 2-metre social distance can’t be maintained. Equally important is hand hygiene. I carry my hand sanitiser whenever I am out in public, and as soon as I’m back home I wash my hands with soap.

Fortunately nobody I know in person has been infected.
I wear masks pretty much at all times, but due to the recent heat, when I walk to the station I use a quiet route with less people and I hold the mask in my hand. As I get closer to the station I will put it back on.
I see people walking on quiet/empty streets without masks, but in most cases I can
see them wearing it around their chin, hold it in their pockets, or in their hands.
I’m assuming they will put it back on once they reach a more crowded area.
I’d say 99.8% of everyone I see on the train are wearing masks.
We’re not forced, but since wearing masks in public was a very normal thing for us way before the covid, I guess we don’t have that much problems.

The thing is, my temperature is fine, just not according to those machines. It became a running joke at this point as I’m not the only one experiencing it.

Covid-19 is expected to strengthen the gig economy and rise in freelance projects. Demand for freelance jobs is on the rise as organizations get increasingly used to the virtual workplace and remote working, and in some cases, cutting fixed employee costs post the Coronavirus outbreak.

Will this rise keep on increasing until a cure is found or is it just a temporary rise?",N/A,N/A,N/A,josh01omondi,6,"For me I think it will be a temporary rise since most people prefer the 9 to 5 job because of some benefits like using the companies car, house allowance and those sort of things.
Plus freelancing can sometimes be monotonous. Yes you will have flexibility, but working alone without any social contacts may lead to anxiety, mental illness and even it may affect your physical health.
I personally prefer freelancing since it gives me the chance to expand my skills by tackling different projects and working with different clients. Who you work for also determines your success.
If you have a good boss, you are most likely to become really good at what you do. Freelancing will give me the opportunity to work for different clients and satisfy different needs.

I believe the gig economy will only increase further, regardless of any COVID cure. This trend had already begun long before the pandemic – years in fact. Fiverr was created in 2010, and freelancing was already a rising trend. I, myself, joined this site in 2014, and freelancing was very strong back then. The trend did not start with the pandemic, and it won’t end with a cure.

6 Ways COVID-19 is Changing the Tech Industry (& Our Lives),COVID-19 Discussions,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/6-ways-covid-19-is-changing-the-tech-industry-our-lives/497655,N/A,dmaxstudio,,"1. Virtual Tools Are Now the Norm for Everyday Life
Over the past several months, families went from typical public school attenders to home-schooling households. It’s a major shift, but a necessary one to keep little ones safe. This is all made possible with online schooling using tablets and laptops.
At the same time, consumers are changing how they’re engaging with businesses. Take, for example, banking — apps and AI tools are being promoted heavily by financial institutions to cut down on in-person visits and prevent bottlenecks in their phone lines.
Now, there’s an adoption of touchless biometric tech for customers to check out with. Soon, eye scanners may begin replacing fingerprint and chip card readers.
But what’s most notable is how people now work. Roughly 50% of Americans are currently working from home full-time. Anyone who doesn’t perform manual labor is now operating from their home office, dining room table, or patio. Thanks to tech companies like Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Asana, these companies were able to transition their workforce into a remote staff.
2. Telehealth Platforms Take Over the Health Industry
Patients who don’t need emergency medical care are finding themselves face-to-face with their physicians via webcam. Telehealth platforms are making it possible for doctors and their patients to continue their visits without exploiting themselves to possible COVID-19 infection.
This includes various medical industries, such as physical therapy, primary care, and psychiatric therapy.
Having sessions from the comfort of your couch could become the preferred method in the future.
3. Tracking Tools Will Diminish Individual Privacy
Contact tracing — it’s the phrase of the new decade, thanks to COVID-19. And because of it, individuals may lose more privacy than they’re comfortable with.
In case you haven’t heard — contact tracing is the government’s attempt to put together a task force (and apps) to keep track of who interacts with who. All in the name of hunting down who may have been exposed to those infected by CV-19.
Smartphones will be the main source of this information, and tech companies are jumping on the gravy boat. Companies like Safer and SwipedOn already have smartphone apps ready to go for business use.
4. Virtual Reality Becomes a Necessity (vs. a Luxury)
The emergence of VR technology was long-awaited by older generations who grew up watching sci-fi movies like Total Recall and Demolition Man.
Now that it’s here, it’s become a luxury tool to enjoy video games, movies, and social interactions in a whole new way. But now, with a pandemic at everyone’s doorstep, virtual reality is becoming more of a necessity.
Today, VR headsets and AR (augmented reality) are being used to view virtual tours of homes, shop for home goods, and to travel the world (since many are still stuck at home). It’s also being used for education, medical care, and employee training.
5. Drone Deliveries Will Become the Norm
It was always inevitable that drones would one day become the delivery drivers of e-commerce purchases. But it was COVID-19 that sped up the process.
Now, there’s an expectation that federal regulators will streamline the process of delivery drone adoption. Even if it means cutting red tape faster than usual.
These drones will be implemented in lifesaving efforts, which include delivering medicine to the elderly and sick, or even test kits to households.
You can already see drones used for surveillance and monitoring by local police across different counties.
6. Remote Work is Likely to Stay
You have roughly 80% of remote workers saying their happier operating from home. Another 43% are even hoping they can continue working remotely after the pandemic ends.
If businesses pay attention to the needs and demands of their workforce, then you may see remote work here for the long-term.
The paradigm is also shifting for small business owners and entrepreneurs. Those in need of workers who are affordable and flexible are using platforms like Fiverr to find top talent.
Some are looking for web developers to transform their brick-and-mortars into virtual stores. Others are looking to expand their website services to include chatbots to meet the increasing demand for digital sales, customer service, and tech support.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-20 19:01:00.275013

One of my sisters works in customer support and her boss, the giant doofus that he is, kept declining to let people work from home because “it’s not work, it’s a vacation” when pandemic first hit. He was eventually forced to let people stay home but only after subway got closed due to quarantine. And it turned out, the overall productivity went up. Turned out, him running into the room screaming at his employees at random intervals through the day wasn’t that much of a motivator. Funny that.

In my opinion there is a massive difference in the mindsets of people who are genuinely freelance because they choose to be, and those who are freelance because they have to be.
Those who choose to be freelance tend to be good at what they do, dedicated to the task in hand but also quite fun people to be around.
Those who have to be freelance tend to overthink their work (not always a good trait), they tend to be a little nervous and look for any opportunity to secure a permanent job.
I’m in my late 40s so I’ve seen a lot of people with the above characteristics in my working life! In my opinion everything will settle down after a while and return to normal.
Existing businesses will start to expand agin, new businesses will begin, people will change careers, retire, etc. The world always move on. It might take a few months or even two or three years… but the temporary increase in freelancers that we will inevitably see will even out over time.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:51 am",2020-08-20 19:01:10.996369

Of course, there is the startup, which will either make or break someone. Those that rise to the top will always find a way. Those that fail were either never meant to freelance or do not have the talent.
I know when I hire people on this platform for certain jobs, it creates multiple orders. For example, whiteboard animators: I hire seller, they hire a voice over and maybe even a script writer. At the end, 3 people got a job.
I haven’t written a story in a long time, but when I did and will do again, it involves many sellers. I hire beta reader, editor, proofed, cover designers, etc.
I am due to retire in about 2 years. I am really looking forward to that date. I can start doing some real freelancing. I want to write more ebook, stories, blogs, etc.
I think 5r is a great place for professional editors, proofreaders, etc. to make a side income. The only thing is no filter for people with no skills.

I also have many return and regular customers, and while some were affected due to the nature of their business, others weren’t, or even had more to do, that probably evened it out a bit.
My plan in case I’d have had more free time than I’d have liked for more than a month was actually not to lower my prices but to set up some new gigs and do more “offline” and with my own site.
I guess lowering one’s prices might work in a pinch but if they are already fair or even a bit (or much) lower than they should be, it can be problematic to rise them again when it becomes unsustainable.
In addition to that, I have to pay exactly the same for everything myself, partly even more (groceries have become more expensive), so lowering my own prices while my COL stays the same or is even higher, seems a bad idea, unless I’d not get enough orders as it is.
I’ll be flexible if I have to, but for now, I’m happier with cutting down on my non-essential expenses, doing an order ot two less per week, and having more time for other things than work.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:17 am",2020-08-20 19:01:21.709374

However, I can say with certainty that there is a drastically increased level of competition on Fiverr, as a result of the global pandemic. More sellers, means existing sellers tend to see lower metrics from the search results. Perhaps there are too many people trying to sell services for your keywords, and your services aren’t being seen as much.
It’s also worth noting that, people just might not be searching for your services as much. The world is changing – even moreso because of Covid. Perhaps there isn’t as much demand for your services now, compared to in the past.

@mariashtelle1 is correct… most stores may be out of liquid hand sanitizers, but I’ve been seeing plenty of bar soaps. Those are just as good as liquid hand soap. Heck, dish soap should work too – I wash my hands in our kitchen sink with dish soap all the time.
The point is to wash your hands with soap and water. Soap comes in many formats.
If you can’t find medical face masks, use a bandana or a scarf. The point is to stop YOURSELF from potentially spreading the virus. Medical professionals have been saying that, if necessary, bandanas and scarfs are better than nothing.

Don’t believe everything you read. That article sounds just as a click bait and not like a reliable source. I wouldn’t google to prove if it’s right or wrong but I will give you a couple of question for some critical thinking:
All countries has contracts set up in place on the amount of export and import. Usually they have few chains of suppliers coming from different countries to sustain flow of products in case if there is a political/economical problem with one of the suppliers. That means that they need to honor their deals and they can not just say that let’s say Australia wouldn’t get their groceries (or whatever else) just because China decided to buy it. Everyone has contractual obligations.
However supply chains are indeed suffering right now because this products have never been in such a demand and there was a certain amount of stock produced. When everything suddenly got sold out it still takes tome to produce it. And now it’s not only to produce it but also increase the capacity of your factories to produce higher amount of stock. Which takes time. And we are in the situation where a lot of factories have been stopped not even talking about increasing their production.
I’m sure China is buying a lot but they are also sending a lot of help including physical goods to other countries that need more help.
So I totally wouldn’t take seriously that article. Or I would’ve done the research to confirm that info.",N/A,"Apr 6, 2020 5:43 am",2020-08-20 19:02:45.020393

Is Corona Virus Pandemic really directly or indirectly affecting Orders?
There are many reasons why your sales levels could rise or fall. Let’s not get into the habit of conveniently blaming the Covid pandemic for everything. I’ve been seeing a lot of sellers doing this lately. Perhaps your competitors are doing a better job winning over your potential clients. Maybe there just isn’t as much demand for your services, or perhaps your service offering has grown a bit stale, and needs to be updated. Maybe your gig has entered rotation in the search results, and isn’t being seen by as many people as before. Are you doing any self-marketing? Are you doing anything on your own to connect to your target customers?
If things aren’t going as well as they once were, perhaps there are things that YOU can do to turn things back around. Trying to find something else to blame for the low sales isn’t a productive way to improve your success.",N/A,"Jul 3, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-08-20 19:02:56.077578

I’m pretty sure my allergies are starting to flare up. I’m not really self-isolating but really just staying to myself. Luckily, I can really rest because I have no work to speak of anymore.

Hope it’s not COVID-19, and something else entirely. Here’s hoping, either way, that you get to feeling better soon.
I’m not too worried about my personal health because if it is COVID-19, at least now I know that it won’t kill me or make me extremely unwell. It honestly feels like that annoying bronchitis that comes after tonsilitis. Irritating and I feel a little rough, but not any worse than a cold. I do however worry about the people I came into contact with before I started presenting symptoms.
emeraldawnn:
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.
Honestly, if it weren’t a worldwide pandemic out there, this almost sounds like an idyllic day. Glad things don’t seem to be too stressful in your family. Get to work on those puzzles!!
graphtersawyer:
I’m absolutely terrified of being sick with anything, so this whole thing has really just made my anxiety skyrocket.
I’m so sorry friend. I’ll be thinking about you and your family. Extremely frustrating when people don’t seem to realize that the spread is totally preventable if we just do the right things
I have OCD (the actual kind) but luckily not related to germs/infection, otherwise I’m sure this would’ve destroyed my mental health. I have a good friend with a dibilitating fear of germs and she is having a really rough time
graphtersawyer:
Does being sick affect your ability to do VO work at all?
Thank god, no. The cough I have is very “chesty” - not mucusy/productive. It feels like my lungs are contracting every 15-20 seconds or so and I have to cough. But I haven’t got a sore throat yet so I can keep churning out work!
lenasemenkova:
No cough, though.
Many people don’t develop a cough. Some people just have a fever, and some people have just the cough. NHS advises anyone with either OR both to self-isolate. Here’s hoping you’ve already had it and now you’re not at risk anymore!! <3",N/A,"Mar 17, 2020 1:21 pm",2020-08-20 19:03:17.155975

Moderator",4,"Ah, @gwyneth_galvin - sorry to hear this. But glad - in a kinda sardonic way - you’re getting it out of the way early.
My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
Here in Glasgow you cannot get paper goods for love nor money. Soap is in very short supply … but not shampoo for some reason. Shelves and shelves of shampoo and conditioner with no one interested in it. At a pinch, you can use that as shower gel and washing up liquid - it all has the same base, apparently.
Luckily, we’d put some stuff aside for Brexit, which we still have … or at least what’s left of it after Brexit didn’t really happen that much.
And yes, that EFT tapping for increasing lung capacity is a great idea. EFT for anything is a good idea. I have a tapping round for making sure your system is open to accepting everything you do for yourself, which is really useful.
@graphtersawyer - take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.
@creativetie - take good care of yourself. Not easy to be alone and sick.

Thats a very positive step from you and the right thing to do. If, god forbids, you develop a fever than you must go to the hospital.
I myself experienced some beginning flu symptoms three days ago, but I believe that it is just the season allergies that start to kick in. Today I woke up without any symptoms. I am isolating myself as well, even though I don’t have symptoms, and only going out for groceries with mask and gloves. Its the least we can do.
The main symptoms are, from what I’ve understood: dry cough, fever and difficulty to breathe. If your nose is runny, that is not corona. Its some kind of other flu.",N/A,"Mar 18, 2020 4:51 am",2020-08-20 19:03:32.797063

Even though they are less likely to get sick, they can spread it. Until we have a full picture of how bad or not bad it is, we can not make rational decisions. Right now it is preparing for worse case scenarios. We have no real data from tests. We need testing. No real guidance from the Government. State leaders are figuring things out on their own. Where I live they are turning DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) stations into testing centers. We are about 7 weeks past our first case in the US, and we are just getting testing going. Nuts.
Will everyone get tested if it is free? Non citizens? Will they risk going to the hospital and getting deported? Just my personal thoughts. Frustrating to watch it unfold in slow motion.

The metrics are still being accrued, they just aren’t being displayed. Gigs have not stopped gaining impressions just because the impressions are not being displayed.
Do you really believe the analytics data is stored correctly everywhere in Fiverr’s databases etc. (eg.in all relevant tables) and that it just can’t show those values?
Don’t you think the analytics page just basically took values that were already stored somewhere (like in fields in a particular table or that could easily be calculated from them) and then displayed them (eg. in the graph/as values)?
It’s not really a “display issue” if it’s wrong in one or more places in the database. The analytics page wouldn’t read through lots of data to show one value to the user as it wouldn’t be efficient.
Why would it take multiple weeks to show a value that is already stored correctly when the code for showing that data in the graph hasn’t really changed? Where’s the difficulty in showing a value that is already stored correctly using the method they already had? And if it was correct everywhere in the database, why was it only recent days’ values that started being shown as 0 when the previous days were being shown correctly (before they changed everything to show “N/A”).
It’s obviously stored wrong somewhere (if stored at all in that place) in the database and that was what was getting displayed before they changed it to show “N/A”. And they’re obviously trying to fix the values somewhere in the database (even if it’s right somewhere else) or get it to start writing the values correctly somewhere in the database for a seller’s analytics figures (eg. daily/weekly/monthly totals).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-08-20 19:04:56.002505

And yes the numbers (such as daily/weekly/monthly totals) for things like clicks or conversions might get used by the algorithms(s) used by the search engine.

I don’t think Fiverr is giving a full enough version of what is actually happening by saying what they have. They’re saying it’s a “display issue” just so it doesn’t seem that big of an issue - but it’s taken weeks to try and fix and the last post in the “N/A” thread says it will still be a few more weeks. Values might be getting stored in one place but not in the place needed by the gigs screen - it’s not stored correctly in the place in the database that that gigs screen reads (eg. the totals - and that could effect other things like the search engine if that also reads those totals).
It’s obviously not just a “display issue”. It must be stored incorrectly somewhere for it to have shown it incorrectly like they did. Like I said, it would be too inefficient for it to be reading lots of records before showing the monthly/weekly/daily totals for each gig (in the “gigs” page) so it’s very unlikely to be doing that (it would have to keep re-reading all those tons of records each time you reloaded the page) - instead it will have been using stored values - and they will have recently (before the “N/A” change) been incorrect (or not set).
Fiverr haven’t said what exactly has caused this or whether those values/totals for clicks/views etc. for gigs are correct in every place in the database(s) or anywhere else they’re stored - or explained why a piece of code that was displaying the values suddenly stopped working (what changed apart from the stored data that was used by that code?).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-08-20 19:04:57.932603

They have told us what we need to know. Nothing is stopping any seller from earning sales. And, as is often said on this forum, earning sales is an issue of seller self-responsibility, not waiting around for Fiverr to provide sales. We know what we need to know. Fiverr – or any Fiverr display error – is not keeping anyone from being responsible and earning their success.

So since Fiverr haven’t given us a full enough story about what has happened and whether the data is correct in every place in the database(s) etc. we can’t really continue saying that it’s being stored correctly (at least not everywhere).

Yes but Fiverr should really be open enough about the issue, especially if people are going to repeat what they say as though all values are correctly stored everywhere (which, if that was true, it would surely be easy to display it).

I’m not asking for intricate insider details of things. Though I’d just want them to be honest enough about what’s happening. I’d rather be told “There are issues with the system but we are working to get it fixed as soon as possible” than something like “everything is being stored correctly everywhere - we just can’t display it/it’s just a display issue” if that is not fully what has happened (or obviously not what has happened).

So you promise the stats are stored/totalled correctly everywhere in the database(s) where the fields for them are? Including in the place in the db that the “gigs” page looks for them?
And don’t you think that it’s implied that they’re stored correctly everywhere necessary by “and all the metrics are calculated as usual.” - when surely that can’t actually be the case. They can’t be calculated & stored correctly everywhere necessary if the gigs screen was showing the more recent ones as “0” (when the code to display the more recent days figures would have been exactly the same as the less recent ones - if everything was correct & the stored the same in the db as it usually was).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 6:10 pm",2020-08-20 19:05:03.666703

One family member is in very critical condition who’s fighting for her life and the rest, including me, are showing mild symptoms. June was going to be my most successful month in terms of numbers of orders and revenue. But with all of this going on in my country and particularity in family, I can’t focus on my work at all. I have lost the will to work and I just want to spend next few weeks with my family only. I’m not in a mental condition to deal with my customers and in this situation, money is the last thing I’m caring for.
Therefore, I have paused my best selling gig for quarantine period at least. My concern is if I get back to work by the end of June, would I continue from the same position or my gig would be de-ranked? I don’t want to lose my hard earned first page spot due to a very legible reason. Please let me know how worse this hit is going to be. Thanks!",N/A,1,"Jun 14, 2020 3:01 pm",miiila,5,"Sorry to read that. I fear nobody can tell you how bad the hit for your ranking might be; some people post that they experience long slump periods after breaks, others say it picks up again soon for them. Chances are that your gig will be de-ranked, as Fiverr wants to show buyers active gigs, obviously, (or even because of normal gig rotation), so I think it’s unprobable that you would continue from the same position if your gig is inactive for two weeks or longer, but how bad it will be/how long it will take to rank higher again, your guess is as good as anybody else’s.
However, half of June is over already, and as you say it was your best month yet, and it’s just two weeks until end of June, and money is the last thing you care for, maybe just do it and take care of your family and yourself those two weeks, especially if a family member is in critical condition, but that’s something you have to decide for yourself.
In any case, though, if you feel you’re having a mental breakdown, press pause ASAP.
All the best to your whole family!",N/A,"Jun 14, 2020 2:15 pm",2020-08-20 19:05:19.752705

I saw somewhere that Micha Kaufman (sp?) say the overall bottom line has increased on 5r since the C-19.
Apparently, with people working from home, they’re using more and more freelancers to help out. Even though many people in USA were laid off, businesses still need their skills.
Since SB can’t afford full timers, they are turning to part timers, which includes freelancers from all platforms.

I know sellers who are doing just fine during the months of COVID – just as they were before COVID. I know some who are even having fantastic sales levels. I also know some sellers who are seeing a slight drop in sales, but nothing noticeably connected to the global pandemic. And I still see countless new sellers (as I have for years) who have no sales at all because they aren’t doing anything to compete in the marketplace. Sales largely have nothing to do with the coronavirus at all, and everything to do with the seriousness, and the willingness of sellers to be proactive and build their own success – no matter what is happening in the world.
Let’s be mindful that we don’t fall into the trap of always trying to find something else to blame for our lack of success. If your sales aren’t at the level you want them to be, then change your tactics, experiment, find new ways to connect with your target customers.

Point of fact, my own sales have not decreased, at all, due to COVID (I know other sellers who can say the same), so, again, this poll is just a poll. It’s just a fun forum poll. It is nothing more than the random opinion of 14 people on the Fiverr forum.

I went from 10-15 messages and 5 orders a day to zero messages and zero orders for two weeks and all of that happened overnight (one of the first days of May) It’s good to also state that April was my best month on the platform so it makes 0 sense why this issue appeared but apparently quite a few sellers are reporting the same thing! Each one of my gigs went from top-3 best-selling to the bottom of the last page overnight and I gotta be honest… It sucks! I really hope that they fix this as investing 150% of your energy to build a good profile with a solid portfolio and make a brand out there to just get it all flushed down the toilet overnight just sucks. And I was just starting to get a really good amount of orders because I had the reviews, I made my gigs look the way I wanted them to look, I was getting decent impressions and my prices were fair and solid. I even took some steps in expanding my business because it was starting to get hard managing all the orders so I bought a drawing monitor for my cousin and I started teaching him what I do so that he can help me but I guess it won’t happen. If your theory is right I hope that they fire the dude who suggested this idea. A lot of sellers who were working hard and building their profiles providing amazing services are not getting any orders now since the beginning of May and their gigs are nowhere to be seen and some of them commented in the Forum that they will start to look for alternatives because having zero control over your gig ranking is discouraging. Imagine doing everything perfect - Solid amount of sells, competitive prices, unique service, professional looking gig with a perfect rating and then losing everything overnight without a real reason with 0 certainty if you’re going to ever get your ranking back after all of the hard work to make everything perfect to stay on the spot that you just lost.

Fiverr is a business. I can assure you, they are undoubtedly taking their business model VERY seriously. It would be bad business if they weren’t. And, since the search system isn’t broken, they’re doing well upholding their chosen business model.
hamza1424:

You do remember that the world is experiencing a pandemic, and millions of workers have lost their jobs, right? Perhaps Fiverr does not have the option of hiring new workers right now – especially when existing/remaining workers are staying home, and not able to work at the office like they once did.

Oftentime we observe that whenever there a pandemic took place in the world all the people are compelled to suffer through the pain of loosing their loved ones, loosing employment and going through monetary disadvantages. Which ulitimately throws a blow to their psychological stability. Resulting in the familial chaos and even random behavioural changes in some persons. Which is often termed as insanity.
Causes Behind Outspread :
Majority of the world population do not directly contribute to the formation of a chaotic situation like the current CODIV-19 pandemic, but a very few people can be called to be the ultimate responsibles behind it. Exploitation of the natual aroma or the coverage by practicing unimaginable food diet is one of the causes behind it. This is not very new the world has faced but there were famines which destroyed the civilised fabric of the world for several times. Yes, causes behind those things were still can be attributed to few people again because to carry on preventive measures all the governments were required to be prance but the absense of which opened the door for these evilsome disasters to come forth. Though the role of natural calamity can not be ignored at all.
But the entire blame can not be attributed to the handful of people because even after the outbreak of COVID-19 and instead of being fully aware of its preventive measures people are coming outsite, having fight with the implementors of the regulations and ultimately widening the evenue for the virus to come in.
So we can say that it is lack of “morality” and the “sense of Protection” that is generating the havoc. This kind of situations will again take place as the evidances from the future but amalgamation of awereness and proactive thinking with maorality will help us to reduce its intensity in future.
Roles Of Online Market Places In Situations Of Financial Crisis :
In our age-old days people faced the same situations again and again. They faced the same financial crisis with more severe outcomes.But in current era the situation have completed a full circle with the advent of Information Technology(IT) and its widespread to each and every corner of the world. As blessing of which new marketplaces like “fiverr” have come to us like the blessings from heaven. Earlier people have less employment opportunity. They either had to rely on their employers for their payments and the services but fiverr have changed the entire scenario by providing opportunity to all the sellers to choose their own services and also to generate a handsome revenue online sitting at home. In the current phase it is not possible to go outside for the search of an offline employment due to ongoing worldwide lockdown. But it does not prevent us from generating revenue as we have fiverr with us.Realising “the hero inside me”, as per the quote, has been made possible by this marketplace. It did not make us to realise that we are really in the lockdown state.
And when it comes to counter the “Psychological Instability” I would say, it provides us with plenty of work that there is no time to let our psyche turn instable. And the monetary needs are also getting supplemented.
Overall I,being a member of this fiverr communinty,am feeling honoured to get the opportunity to get into the regime, thanks to the team. Due to your effort many of the families are now supplementing their needs and many have turned itno well-off and famous beings just after working with you thus a greatest salute to you.

My sales have been affected by the Coronavirus, but otherwise! I have received more orders than ever in my entire stay here at Fiverr. I usually get 1 order every 1-2 months even though I am a level 1 and it was very frustrating. But now I always keep myself busy and when I finish orders new customers write to me, I have never felt what it is like to have several orders in a queue and I am surprised by all the work I am having.
All my new orders are helping me significantly to be promoted to level 2 in the next few months, when I thought I would get to be level 2 in 1-2 years.
I thought all of you would be doing well too, I thought something that was logical at the time, since no one can get out, it’s better to hire freelancers these days. No salary, no physical contact, no barriers = same (or better) result.

Welcome to Fiverr and the Fiverr Forum.
I joined Fiverr 2.83 years ago, so I can say that I did not join Fiverr to feel productive during the pandemic.
I took a peek at your gigs. I noticed that you have a gig for proofreading school papers and essays. Fiverr TOS, which you agreed to when you joined Fiverr state:
Third-party TOS violation - By taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) you are actively taking part in a violation of the integrity code of most, if not all, schools and academic institutions. This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities.
Fiverr could give you an account warning or even remove your account for offering these services. It will be best for you to either delete or modify your gig not to provide to proofread school work.",N/A,"May 12, 2020 1:01 am",2020-08-20 19:08:04.505967

I saw this coming years ago. However I am starting to worry that I don’t have enough supplies ready for the supermarket shutdowns. In this case, I’m presently buying lots of vinegar. With this, I plan to pickle 500 eggs.
If I eat 5 pickled eggs a day, this will last me 100 days which is the approximate length of winter. After that, I can fish for my food.

My Fiverr-related business has slowed, BUT that opened up more time for my non-fiverr-based businesses to ramp up. I’ve had time to build out my studio, update and learn new software, take a few online learning courses that I could not have earlier due to the amount of work. Everything I do now is with the intent of what happens when this is all over (the lockdown and economic downturn). There are still opportunities to do more. I’ve began learning guitar, conversational Spanish and completed a couple of Adobe software certifications and every night I sit out on my patio and watch Netlix and drink a Modelo beer (I may have a pending drinking problem, but nobody’s perfect) and look at the stars.
I’ve seen bad before. I’ve been broke and homeless before, so that doesn’t really frighten me. My hopes for everyone is to stay healthy, find the opportunity in this pandemic to learn something - do something - say something or be something that you’ve always wanted to. I ask the question : When this ends, and it will end, what YOU do you want to be? It was Nietzsche that said “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how”. I focus on the “why”. It has been my experience that the “how” always takes care of itself. Those are just my thoughts.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2020 11:44 am",2020-08-20 19:08:18.774197

I have stocked up on a variety of foods in case that day comes when food is not available.
I’ve also researched the various types of bottled water here and found Fiji Water, which has the best taste, has trace amounts of uranium in it, so I’ve switched to a more local source which has remarkably pure water with zero uranium, which Perrier and S. Pellegrino also have. Some bottled water even has things like lead in it.
I have found an online doctor service which will prescribe most non-controlled medications also and used them once so far and it took all of ten minutes to get the prescription I requested, by phone, sent to my local pharmacy. I wish I had found this much sooner. Visiting a doctor here can be an all afternoon ordeal, with hours spent in a crowded waiting room, where I feel under suspicion of being a drug addict, and am told to visit another place with another crowded waiting room to get blood tests.
Nutrition and exercise are top priorities now. In the past five years I’ve had two small emergency operations and do not want that to happen again, as it would be a disaster at this time to need to go to a hospital for any reason.

Only thing I miss now is the gym. Joined it last year as new year’s resolution. I had a good routine until February. Decided to stay at home after hearing about virus. And I am too lazy to workout at home.
Trust me, you will regret not trying to maintain something like your workout routine. One day you will say to yourself ""nah, I can skip working out today, I’ll make up for it tomorrow.""

I actually had both of these. Lost 45 pounds recently.

nah, I can skip working out today, I’ll make up for it tomorrow.
I am a man of culture, whenever I say “I can skip working out today”, it is never followed by “I’ll make up for it tomorrow”. Lol.
I haven’t gained any weight as I keep a close track on my diet, I actually lost a pound or two in last 2 months but I am surely not going to enjoy the sore muscles after I start the gym again.
Every night I decide to start working out and put my treadmill to good use, but in morning, I very conveniently “forget” it. I even installed a workout app, and uninstalled it, and installed it again. Hopefully I’ll start from tomorrow morning.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2020 2:12 pm",2020-08-20 19:08:24.396465
