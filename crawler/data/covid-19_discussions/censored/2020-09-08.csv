Aside from that, I know a lot of places are canceling events, but churches are having to ramp up the graphics and content to compensate for the online services we’ll be doing until it’s safer to be in large gatherings. Plus, Easter is coming up. The Bible belt has been busy.

“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

You need to provide the best possible work to make them forget about other places, you must give them quality that they will not get in other places I’m not speaking about price believe me if you have money you will buy a Porsche rather than Fiat if you know what I mean so every customer ready to pay for a good product as they understand that with that they will look better and can success, every time lowering prices and giving even low quality product isn’t the way we should try to keep on fiverr. I recommend to read more and study better to become a better skilled in what you do every time you have a time this is the only way to attract more customers. In these days the whole world is fighting with unseen virus which is not a joke and because of massive isolation it’s very natural that everything will loose the grip and become more slow so imagine if every seller who have a drop on sales will message to fiverr and ask why they aren’t get as many orders as they want? I have printed flyers and hire 2 girls to share them with people I buy a places to make advertisements I go to different forums and workshops I meet people and tell about my business on fiverr I try to advertise as much as I can my gigs. I’m not a specialist in this maybe I do many wrong things but I try at least I don’t seat and ask fiverr to give me a buyers I have a buyers outside of fiverr I invite them I recommend them to use fiverr I’m an artist designer I never do marketing I don’t understand much and it costs me a lot of energy and I feel not comfortable doing that many things but I know that if each of us will try to do something which will help fiverr that will be only good for all of us. Sorry if I write anything wrong or anyhow you can think I offend in any case please don’t take this personal I just speak in general it’s about my feelings and thoughts which I follow, you can give me your opinion and I can learn from it much, thank you and stay safe we all should try to pass through this with understanding and compassion to each other stay safe",,"Mar 27, 2020 6:47 pm",2020-09-07 14:18:12.335167

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

What do you think guys??",,1.0,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,9.0,"First of all, Please accept my deepest condolence. Recently, Armenia reports first death related to coronavirus which is pretty sad
You’re right, If I’m not getting any orders then there is something wrong with me. Maybe my gigs, images, title, keywords & my skills are not not working for me. I will change them & improve my gigs & skills soon. But please note: I’m not bashing Fiverr here & I’m not complaining about not getting orders
I started this discussion to verify that if (COVID-19) is the reason for not getting any sales right now. And yes I was right. (This Coronavirus pandemic changed the world including Fiverr) Usually I receive 5-6 messages per day or sometimes 2-3 orders a day. But from last 26 days, No one is contacting me & no one is ordering my gigs which was pretty strange for me that’s why I started this.
Repeat customers are the reason of my survival on Fiverr. I’m a seller here for more than 6 years now so yeah I know what I’m doing here. I often advertise & promote my gigs on different platforms & yes on on my social media accounts as well. I even have a “Marketing budget” for my gigs. Yes, I usually invest my 20% earning on advertising which is essential for my online business. When I’ve started in 2014 the competition for me was not that strong. Yes “My Main Job was to speed up wordpress sites much faster” & that time no one was competing with me.
You can go to Fiverr & just search this: wordpress speed optimization (You will find 100+ gigs about speed optimization) Yeah exactly like the logo ones. Everyone is a expert in this field now I’m talking about wordpress speed optimization here.
2014 (When I was just 18-19 years old kid) 2020 (When I’m 24 right now & much for experienced & professional)
So yeah I improved a lot & yes even my personal life is changed now
I stopped working here for more than 2 years because of some personal reasons but when I started again in 2019 everything about this marketplace was changed. Fiverr PRO area, You can take skills & other tests. So I was happy that they’re improving this marketplace but then I activated the paused gigs & realized that no one is messaging me. I searched my gigs & found out that every other seller is offering my services, which was just shocking for me. I invested my time & money on my profile & then orders start coming again. I even messaged my previous buyers so they can know that I’m back here
Everything was normal that time then in January 2020 my impressions, views & clicks were decreasing every single day. (Strange) right!!
I contacted Fiverr support & they told me that everything is fine with your account but I still told them to check it again & they replied: Everything is normal but I can feel that everything was not normal that time. February was a pretty good month for me but then this March month destroyed everything
I can’t even express my feelings with you, I’m so sad & worried right now. & please don’t say sorry to me & yeah I don’t take anything personally so don’t worry

No no, Please try to understand that main purpose was to show the impact of the coronavirus on businesses.
To be honest, I am getting sick of people trying to remind me of the impact on businesses. I have a friend who secured the lease on a restaurant just before this. He was due to open in a few days, can’t, and is still contractually obliged to pay $1,200 rent each month for the next year.
I know a couple who own a shop who can’t open and are stuck in a similar boat with no income coming in.
I use a mobile grocer to buy my groceries who is now no longer able to do his rounds, and the last time he was here last week, there was a pretty depressed guy I know asking how many individual eggs he could buy with what change he had.
I live on a street of bar and restaurant workers, none of whom are going to be able to pay their rent very soon. Any who are foreign have also been told that if they do not have jobs or are not economically self sufficient, they will need to go back to their own countries by the government. - Despite the only airport being closed.
Now it seems like every time I come here, I have someone I do not know from Adam asking me to help them out, think of them, or do something to help fight Covid-19 by donating my time or skills for free to nondescript charitable causes.
I’m very sorry that you are experiencing hardship. However, like it or not, nobody here can help. It is really as simple as that and the worst thing you can do is continue going around in circles asking people to care or help. Instead, you need to figure out how to help yourself.

I get that. Also, I am sincerely sorry that you are in a tight spot. However, to be very blunt, a lot of people are and things are only going to get worse. In this case, you need to start thinking outside the box.
People and businesses in your area will be struggling right now. Is it possible that you could help by reaching out to them directly and offering budget-friendly wen development,graphic design, or marketing services, even if you outsource some of these?
You would literally just have to send a letters to each one. (No one reads emails, but letters can still work.)
That is just one basic idea that may not be applicable to you at all, but you need to start looking for solutions like that yourself. You could also play ith your pricing a little. Lower the price of your most pricey web design gig, but increase the price of your $10 gigs.
Maybe also re-evaluate your delivery times. No offense, but I don’t believe you can build me a full, fully responsive website in 2-days. Maybe create a 1-day consultation gig or package, and increase delivery time on your web design gig to something like 5-days.
Whatever you do, good luck. However, you really do need to start with you doing something, rather than asking for people to share their excess orders with you. Quite frankly, most people likely don’t have excess orders to start with.",,"Mar 28, 2020 4:21 pm",2020-09-07 14:18:21.418232

It doesn’t matter. Fiverr doesn’t allow sellers contacting buyers after order is done. It takes only one person not to like it and that’s it, best she will get a warning, worst he will loose her account.
In a real world it would’ve been an ok practice however it’s forbidden on fiver. If you want to risk your account - that’s fine, but do not advise others potentially harmful things.

I’ve never told her to do spam.
wpfalcon:
I’m saying that she can contact 3-4 buyers who recently ordered her gig & she can ask them politely if they’re interested to order more gigs from her.
Why are people keep giving this same bad advice while trying to present it as something other than spam? “Oh no, it’s not spam at all, it’s just bothering your recent clients like they can’t reorder a gig themselves if they need anything”.
If you think it’s a clever marketing strategy and it has never backfired on you yet, it’s because you never yet came across a customer who got irritated enough to report you. And something’s telling me that these days when everyone’s counting their money, it’d be easier to irk a person by asking to spend more.
It’s an unsolicited contact either way. It doesn’t have to be 1000+ messages to be qualified as spam. You’re not supposed to ask buyers (or other sellers) for work. They know where and how to find you when and if they need you.",,"Apr 2, 2020 4:47 am",2020-09-07 14:18:33.439421

You really need to think on your execution. You are missing a lot of points. Let’s start with the Non-US. Which counties will that be? Do you realise that NON-US also includes Russia, China, South American countries, Australia and all European countries?
Secondly to operate like that you will need to register yourself with a government under a certain licence. Are you working on registering yourself as a charity? Otherwise your website will be nothing but a scam (even if you don’t think so). You can not register yourself as a sole trader otherwise you will have to pay tax on every donation you get as on normal income. If you are not planning to register yourself then again it will be illegal. + all the points that @jonbaas added.
It might be noble what you are thinking to do but it looks like you are not even realising what work will stand behind that and what will be the process of registering and running it.
Website is actually only a tool. You thought of how to make a tool but you didn’t think of how to build a “house”. E.g you need to build a house and instead of hiring an architect and designer and create plans of how your house will look like and workers to build it, you instead of that hired people to create a hammer because you think the hammer is what will build you a house.

In all honesty, what credentials do you have to offer that would make people trust YOU to be the organizer for this “freelance union”?

This is the very nature of anyone choosing to be an independent worker. Independence from any corporate banner, and a self-minded approach to offering services is, by nature, supposed to be a risk freelancers take. Smart freelancers plan for tough times. They don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Freelancers are not unionized, or a cooperative venture. Freelancers take on the responsibility to be their own business – to grow their dreams, and become what they want to become. To be successful, means to take on the risk of failure as well. Without the risk of failure, there can be no success.
I admire those who truly wish to help freelancers, but I just don’t think you’re going about it in a reasonable, strategic or cooperative way. A union begins as a group of like-minded tradesmen, it isn’t one person trying to collect money for dubious distribution. I just don’t feel as though you are thinking this all the way through.

What do you think guys??",,1.0,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",blavaro,4.0,"Do not get me wrong but this calls for big disaster if you do not properly plan what you are going to do.
It seems to me that you actually build up your plan here in this forum listening to what everybody says.
Just and idea, did you consider to hire professionals to set up such business? This may bring also initial trust level at least.
I am just worried that you want to play a game that may get out of your control soon.
Here’s a recent story from my country.
Our government wanted to spend $15 Mio for e-shop with freeways vignettes.
Web developers community said this amount is ridiculous and offered to make it for 10% of that money.
So they collected 40 specialists to develop and build up the site during weekend hackaton.
This group was so eager to show that they can do it in short time for friction of that money and finally they almost did it.
I say almost because just a few hours later after website was live, the site was broken with loss of personal data, cc data and more. Those were professionals but lack of time and proper planning meant failing.
Just be very careful when you think that you have solution for this and that. Are you really sure about it?
Anyway, good luck!",,"Apr 5, 2020 3:47 am",2020-09-07 14:18:43.074435

What do you think guys??",,1.0,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,5.0,"I’m planning this for months now. Yes when (COVID-19) pandemic was not even started. I’m just asking & looking for suggestions here.
Yes I have a small team & I’m also in contact with many professionals. I even sent many e-mails to different organizations who are working for Independent workers or Freelancers. I want their suggestions, advice & ideas. I’m just a normal person like you so yes I will face many challenges for sure.
Note: Freelancers Union is also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.
Some FAQs: (Let’s talk Legal)
So you will register this (Organization) as a Trade Union?
Maybe. Right now I’m just checking every single aspect because even the official (Freelancers Union) is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers). So they’re just a non-profit organization.
So you will register this as a Non-profit organization?
In my country, you can register a (Non-profit organization or NGO/NPO) in three ways. Trust Registration, Society Registration, Section 8 Company Registration (Earlier known as Section 25 Company)
The type of registration you will need depends on the purpose you want to achieve.
Please note that Society and Trust registration is different from business registration. This is because societies, trusts, and NGOS have charitable objectives. On the other hand, a business works only for profit. Therefore, separate laws govern Society and Trust registration. The only exception is a Section 8 company which is governed by the Companies Act, 2013. These entities receive some special tax exemptions and benefits. These benefits are not available to commercial business setups.
Do you have any business plan?
Yes I have a plan so I can achieve my goals. I’m doing my research right now so I can start this (UNION or Organization) so please make sure that If I start this UNION or NGO/NPO someday then I do have a business plan for it.
Do you have any legal team?
Yes I have a legal team so if I needed any kind of registration then I will contact them for sure. I will pay some huge amount for the registration. Also in case of emergencies the legal representative will help me.
Why Should I Trust You?
I’m just a normal freelancer like you. Recently I started this topic when my sales were dropped dramatically. Everything is normal now, But from that day I decided to do something for my community. Yes, Not just planning or thinking but to execute it properly. I don’t want to waste my time on such questions where people were asking me If I’m doing this for any personal gain. I want to help this community & the Freelancers. Specially the NON-US Freelancers. That’s why I’m planning it & I will execute it for sure.
Maybe not today, Next week or Next month but in next few years. So literally no one can stop me right now. I still remember a reply where someone told me that legal things take time so yeah I will wait until it’s done. I want an organization for (NON-US Freelancers) so I’ll try my best to be 100% legal. Otherwise I will not start this anytime soon.
Why you’re wasting your precious time on such Organization?
I just want to help this community, That’s all I want. Maybe someday we have a Union for NON-US Freelancers & I’m sure everyone wants it so we can help each other
What about funding?
Right now I will spend my own money because I want to start a small organization but yes when our (Organization) will get popular then we will find our supporters. Right now the official (Freelancers Union) has received grants and other support from leading foundations such as the Ford Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, New York Community Trust, United Hospital Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, New York State Health Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, Partnership Fund for New York City, Ira W. De Camp Foundation and others.

Things have definitely slowed down in comparison to the last few months and I can only assume it is because of the on-going global pandemic. Try not to stress too much and in the meantime, use this as an opportunity to strengthen and refine your existing brand/image on Fiverr or use it to build a brand new gig altogether.
There is always an opportunity to thrive during times like this but the challenge now is that you need to be extra creative and strategic about your branding, services, customer experience, etc. This is what’s going to set you apart from your competition when the volume of orders is at a low point.
A few key areas that I would personally focus on, if you haven’t already would be: Creating unique and engaging gig images or videos, writing clear and concise gig descriptions, and improving/adding to your existing skillset.
I hope this helps someone!
Best of luck to everyone and remember to be safe,

That’s a funny one you played on Fiverr customer support.
Anyways, even though I believe the Covid-19 posed a serious challenge to the US economy, I still believe their system is quite insulated to a reasonable extent. Most still use ■■■■■, teams, and the likes to further their engagements, hence their need for Fiverr digital services.
You may want to follow the advice of the Customer support, and perhaps, take a few tests to boost your competence in the face of customers.

I was thinking maybe COVID-19 wouldn’t impact business as mush as I feared. Then, about 3 weeks ago, new inquiries and orders dried up suddenly- and almost overnight. It makes sense. With the number of businesses and companies shut down, there’s going to be a decreased need for those places working on projects that would otherwise purchase my services. I’ve still had some new orders trickling in- mostly from repeat buyers. I am thankful for them and am looking forward to things getting back to normal.

“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

I finished high school last year and I know how to develop websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am really good at it and I thought this year was my time to put my skills into use.
All over sudden while I was still doing the national examinations, COVID-19 bumped in. My brother is a professional freelance but he started freelancing a decade ago. He told me the challenges I am getting now may be the impacts of COVID-19.
This various came with many negative impacts. Other than killing people it is also killing the economy. Countries like USA that are know to outsource their jobs to third world countries like where I am from are also struggling to secure jobs for themselves. Hopefully all will be well soon.

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

Thank you for much.
I also want to tell you that two of the sellers cancelled my order for some reason (They ordered the gig without discussing the project and the requirment which was out of my expertise, so they cancelled). Out of two orders Customer support cancelled one of the order on befalf of the buyer due to same circumstances.
Does that affect my gig ranking?
And after all this when I was not getting orders I did some seo and updated my gig category, title and description. But still I’m getting very less impressions around 1.5K and 20 clicks in a week.
I’m little worried and don’t know what to do to get new orders.
I get one or two inquiries in 1-2 days.
Please suggest.",,"Aug 24, 2020 10:44 am",2020-09-07 14:20:15.302338

Does that affect my gig ranking?
First of all, there is no such thing as “gig ranking”. The Fiverr search system is a dynamic algorithm. It does not rank by popularity, it organizes results differently – for each person – according to value to that specific person. Every person looking at the search results will see a different list of gigs, based upon what Fiverr thinks is important to that person searching the results.
That being said, though, yes, any cancellation is likely to affect how the algorithm sees the value of your gig – insofar as it relates to people searching for it.

You don’t “get orders”, you earn them.

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

I fear nobody can tell you how bad the hit for your ranking might be; some people post that they experience long slump periods after breaks, others say it picks up again soon for them. Chances are that your gig will be de-ranked, as Fiverr wants to show buyers active gigs, obviously, (or even because of normal gig rotation), so I think it’s unprobable that you would continue from the same position if your gig is inactive for two weeks or longer, but how bad it will be/how long it will take to rank higher again, your guess is as good as anybody else’s.
However, half of June is over already, and as you say it was your best month yet, and it’s just two weeks until end of June, and money is the last thing you care for, maybe just do it and take care of your family and yourself those two weeks, especially if a family member is in critical condition, but that’s something you have to decide for yourself.
In any case, though, if you feel you’re having a mental breakdown, press pause ASAP.

COVID being problem is not covid issue, it is human and mentality issue.
90% of what governments are asking to be done people should do on their own, applying simple and basic logic.
The moment there is new unknown disease around that is spread by air and particles everyone should wear mask and wash hands and sterilize equipment they are using. Nothing mayor or drastic in doing that. Simple hygiene.
But people are acting like children, teenagers. Government tells me to do something I will not obey.
COVID is fraud, covid is conspiracy, covid is aliens attack…
When someone has a flu or chicken pocks or lice, some follow the rules of hygiene and some think they are above it and refuse to do normal things (wash hair, clean hands, clean clothes, use lotion, constrain yourself from going in to public areas until you are healed etc etc.).
COVID is causing all these problems not because of itself on its own, the problem is human.
Human that is refusing to behave normally.",,"Sep 2, 2020 7:37 am",2020-09-07 14:20:49.349378

However, I can say with certainty that there is a drastically increased level of competition on Fiverr, as a result of the global pandemic. More sellers, means existing sellers tend to see lower metrics from the search results. Perhaps there are too many people trying to sell services for your keywords, and your services aren’t being seen as much.
It’s also worth noting that, people just might not be searching for your services as much. The world is changing – even moreso because of Covid. Perhaps there isn’t as much demand for your services now, compared to in the past.

I opened my account with curiosity and with the idea to explore. I had my graphics business well set in local market that time and I was doing good.
Slowly and steadily my account was developed on Fiverr and I was giving my time and energy on Fiverr but still my main work and especially revenue was getting generated in local market work.
But then Covid pandemic broke and in India, we have been to longest lock-down. Suddenly there was fear in the market. People around in our area started to consider graphics as the luxury thing and it was not considered essential, so I stopped receiving work from the local market. It was the time when starvation was knocking my door along with the frightening health situation around. Thankfully to Fiverr, I could keep getting my living on the platform.

Is Corona Virus Pandemic really directly or indirectly affecting Orders?
There are many reasons why your sales levels could rise or fall. Let’s not get into the habit of conveniently blaming the Covid pandemic for everything. I’ve been seeing a lot of sellers doing this lately. Perhaps your competitors are doing a better job winning over your potential clients. Maybe there just isn’t as much demand for your services, or perhaps your service offering has grown a bit stale, and needs to be updated. Maybe your gig has entered rotation in the search results, and isn’t being seen by as many people as before. Are you doing any self-marketing? Are you doing anything on your own to connect to your target customers?
If things aren’t going as well as they once were, perhaps there are things that YOU can do to turn things back around. Trying to find something else to blame for the low sales isn’t a productive way to improve your success.",,"Jul 3, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-09-07 14:31:45.562752

I’m pretty sure my allergies are starting to flare up. I’m not really self-isolating but really just staying to myself. Luckily, I can really rest because I have no work to speak of anymore. I had a large order come in yesterday and it’s already done and sent off to the client.

Hope it’s not COVID-19, and something else entirely. Here’s hoping, either way, that you get to feeling better soon.
I’m not too worried about my personal health because if it is COVID-19, at least now I know that it won’t kill me or make me extremely unwell. It honestly feels like that annoying bronchitis that comes after tonsilitis. Irritating and I feel a little rough, but not any worse than a cold. I do however worry about the people I came into contact with before I started presenting symptoms.
emeraldawnn:
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.
Honestly, if it weren’t a worldwide pandemic out there, this almost sounds like an idyllic day. Glad things don’t seem to be too stressful in your family. Get to work on those puzzles!!
graphtersawyer:
I’m absolutely terrified of being sick with anything, so this whole thing has really just made my anxiety skyrocket.
I’m so sorry friend. I’ll be thinking about you and your family. Extremely frustrating when people don’t seem to realize that the spread is totally preventable if we just do the right things
I have OCD (the actual kind) but luckily not related to germs/infection, otherwise I’m sure this would’ve destroyed my mental health. I have a good friend with a dibilitating fear of germs and she is having a really rough time
graphtersawyer:
Does being sick affect your ability to do VO work at all?
Thank god, no. The cough I have is very “chesty” - not mucusy/productive. It feels like my lungs are contracting every 15-20 seconds or so and I have to cough. But I haven’t got a sore throat yet so I can keep churning out work!
lenasemenkova:
No cough, though.
Many people don’t develop a cough. Some people just have a fever, and some people have just the cough. NHS advises anyone with either OR both to self-isolate. Here’s hoping you’ve already had it and now you’re not at risk anymore!! <3",,"Mar 17, 2020 1:21 pm",2020-09-07 14:32:05.742162

To be fair, I’m more concerned about my country collapsing on itself than the dang virus. There are very questionable political decisions being made that have nothing to do with the virus but will without a doubt provoke a strong public response (i.e., massive protests). I.e., huge public gatherings in the middle of the pandemic. I had a good long ugly cry about it this morning.

Regular",4.0,"Ah, @gwyneth_galvin - sorry to hear this. But glad - in a kinda sardonic way - you’re getting it out of the way early.
My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
Here in Glasgow you cannot get paper goods for love nor money. Soap is in very short supply … but not shampoo for some reason. Shelves and shelves of shampoo and conditioner with no one interested in it. At a pinch, you can use that as shower gel and washing up liquid - it all has the same base, apparently.
Luckily, we’d put some stuff aside for Brexit, which we still have … or at least what’s left of it after Brexit didn’t really happen that much.
And yes, that EFT tapping for increasing lung capacity is a great idea. EFT for anything is a good idea. I have a tapping round for making sure your system is open to accepting everything you do for yourself, which is really useful.
@graphtersawyer - take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.
@creativetie - take good care of yourself. Not easy to be alone and sick.

@graphtersawyer - take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.
Yes, that is good advice. I am thinking of you too. And I hope your non-concerned household members see the soon.

The metrics are still being accrued, they just aren’t being displayed. Gigs have not stopped gaining impressions just because the impressions are not being displayed.
Do you really believe the analytics data is stored correctly everywhere in Fiverr’s databases etc. (eg.in all relevant tables) and that it just can’t show those values?
Don’t you think the analytics page just basically took values that were already stored somewhere (like in fields in a particular table or that could easily be calculated from them) and then displayed them (eg. in the graph/as values)?
It’s not really a “display issue” if it’s wrong in one or more places in the database. The analytics page wouldn’t read through lots of data to show one value to the user as it wouldn’t be efficient.
Why would it take multiple weeks to show a value that is already stored correctly when the code for showing that data in the graph hasn’t really changed? Where’s the difficulty in showing a value that is already stored correctly using the method they already had? And if it was correct everywhere in the database, why was it only recent days’ values that started being shown as 0 when the previous days were being shown correctly (before they changed everything to show “N/A”).
It’s obviously stored wrong somewhere (if stored at all in that place) in the database and that was what was getting displayed before they changed it to show “N/A”. And they’re obviously trying to fix the values somewhere in the database (even if it’s right somewhere else) or get it to start writing the values correctly somewhere in the database for a seller’s analytics figures (eg. daily/weekly/monthly totals).",,"Jun 11, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-09-07 14:33:46.617504

Daily & weekly or monthly impressions? I’m not sure they can - at least without totalling them in the way (or similar to) they’re trying to get the system to do automatically.
And yes the numbers (such as daily/weekly/monthly totals) for things like clicks or conversions might get used by the algorithms(s) used by the search engine. And if some of them are wrong (incorrectly totalled for some, no values or zero values for others), then it could potentially affect the Fiverr search engine results.

I don’t think Fiverr is giving a full enough version of what is actually happening by saying what they have. They’re saying it’s a “display issue” just so it doesn’t seem that big of an issue - but it’s taken weeks to try and fix and the last post in the “N/A” thread says it will still be a few more weeks. Values might be getting stored in one place but not in the place needed by the gigs screen - it’s not stored correctly in the place in the database that that gigs screen reads (eg. the totals - and that could effect other things like the search engine if that also reads those totals).
It’s obviously not just a “display issue”. It must be stored incorrectly somewhere for it to have shown it incorrectly like they did. Like I said, it would be too inefficient for it to be reading lots of records before showing the monthly/weekly/daily totals for each gig (in the “gigs” page) so it’s very unlikely to be doing that (it would have to keep re-reading all those tons of records each time you reloaded the page) - instead it will have been using stored values - and they will have recently (before the “N/A” change) been incorrect (or not set).
Fiverr haven’t said what exactly has caused this or whether those values/totals for clicks/views etc. for gigs are correct in every place in the database(s) or anywhere else they’re stored - or explained why a piece of code that was displaying the values suddenly stopped working (what changed apart from the stored data that was used by that code?).",,"Jun 11, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-09-07 14:33:48.662533

They have told us what we need to know. Nothing is stopping any seller from earning sales. And, as is often said on this forum, earning sales is an issue of seller self-responsibility, not waiting around for Fiverr to provide sales. We know what we need to know. Fiverr – or any Fiverr display error – is not keeping anyone from being responsible and earning their success.

So since Fiverr haven’t given us a full enough story about what has happened and whether the data is correct in every place in the database(s) etc. we can’t really continue saying that it’s being stored correctly (at least not everywhere).
If it was being stored correctly everywhere, how long really would it take to display that value on screen?

Yes but Fiverr should really be open enough about the issue, especially if people are going to repeat what they say as though all values are correctly stored everywhere (which, if that was true, it would surely be easy to display it).
