Unemployment + Fiver?,COVID-19 Discussions,0,0,0,,,,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/unemployment-fiver/514346,,nickwelchprod,,"I am currently on unemployment because I got laid off from my job. I decided recently to start up a little fiverr store just so I can mostly get experience with music video editing. I am charging $5 for about a weeks worth of work. Now that fiver has asked me for a W-9, how do I report that on my unemployment? Also, is it possible that I can just keep all of the money in my fiver account until after I am off unemployment insurance to avoid paying taxes and showing that I got it yet, I just don’t want to risk losing my unemployment. Thank you!",,,,,,,,,2020-09-09 20:27:44.754433

It really wasn’t easy getting people to notice and trust your gigs. It was also almost impossible to get my offline clients to join Fiverr and order my services.
So I’m mostly working on convincing my clients to join Fiverr (because I feel it’s safer ) and also get people to actually order my gigs😆. It’s not been easy but I have a whole lockdown to keep trying!",,"Sep 8, 2020 5:16 pm",2020-09-09 20:27:53.682614

In the USA, we tip for just about everything: cab drivers, delivery people (except mail), housekeepers, bartenders, even cashiers at fast food joints may have a tip jar.
Far as I know, 5r is the only freelance site with an aggressive tipping feature. You feel like a cheapskate scumbag when not able to tip.
Some countries have no gratuity, therefore confused when pushed to do so after closing an order. I used to like tipping on a “good deal” order but I feel like the push-iness of it is a real turn off.

Most of us aren’t okay with the 20% Fiverr is taking from our earnings. But we just have to apply to their terms and conditions.
Then price your gigs 20% higher. You are a freelancer. You decide your own pricing. Besides, 20% isn’t a lot. Many other platforms where you can sell products or services online charge much more. I sell on Steam, who takes 30% of everything I make, and I also earn quite a bit of money on YouTube, who is estimated to take around 50% or more. You get put in front of an audience of more than a million potential customers for only 20% of your earnings. I think that is a good deal.
Also, who is “most of us”? Do you know for sure that you are speaking for a majority of the users?
coolbrains:
but some buyer’s budget doesn’t worth it.
Then say no to that work. You do not have to accept every single offer. Again, put your prices higher, and you won’t feel like you are wasting your time.
coolbrains:
but you would definitely have it in mind if the buyer would give you a tip or not.
No, I never think about tips ever. It is always a surprise when it happens. I am happy with my pricing (otherwise, I would change it), and I never expect my customers to leave a tip - they do not have to pay a penny more for my services than what I charge.",,"Sep 8, 2020 10:52 am",2020-09-09 20:28:02.010456

Well, I’m happy for you. Some sellers on Fiverr here don’t have any other source of income. They only depend on their earnings on Fiverr. Just like me. We are just starting. 20% isn’t much anyways, but well, it’s more than Tithe What I was trying to say is ‘there are jobs you would want to do at a price you aren’t okay with. Meanwhile your target is to satisfy them, get the review, and build up your account’. So this way, you will want to accept the job at their price. You know you don’t have other source, so you just have to. Right? YES for me.",,"Sep 8, 2020 11:02 am",2020-09-09 20:28:02.351010

This is how Fiverr works, whether you like it or not. Tips do not exist to “get around” the 80-20 revenue-sharing model. That’s why Fiverr takes 20% from all tips as well – so sellers cannot cheat Fiverr by avoiding their 20% revenue share.",,"Sep 8, 2020 3:05 pm",2020-09-09 20:28:03.519464

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

And because of pandemic there isn’t much to do now it’s time to hold and rethink our actions, if you don’t have orders you can always sharpen your skills, I don’t like your sarcastic notice about fiverr’s answer, as fiverr do a lot to make this platform best possible place for all of us by promoting and attracting as many customers as it’s possible. So what we do with our work to support fiverr’s growth? I can’t understand people who think that fiverr owe them anything. Can I ask you why you don’t have buyers? Why you don’t make them return? You need to provide the best possible work to make them forget about other places, you must give them quality that they will not get in other places I’m not speaking about price believe me if you have money you will buy a Porsche rather than Fiat if you know what I mean so every customer ready to pay for a good product as they understand that with that they will look better and can success, every time lowering prices and giving even low quality product isn’t the way we should try to keep on fiverr. I recommend to read more and study better to become a better skilled in what you do every time you have a time this is the only way to attract more customers. In these days the whole world is fighting with unseen virus which is not a joke and because of massive isolation it’s very natural that everything will loose the grip and become more slow so imagine if every seller who have a drop on sales will message to fiverr and ask why they aren’t get as many orders as they want? I have printed flyers and hire 2 girls to share them with people I buy a places to make advertisements I go to different forums and workshops I meet people and tell about my business on fiverr I try to advertise as much as I can my gigs. I’m not a specialist in this maybe I do many wrong things but I try at least I don’t seat and ask fiverr to give me a buyers I have a buyers outside of fiverr I invite them I recommend them to use fiverr I’m an artist designer I never do marketing I don’t understand much and it costs me a lot of energy and I feel not comfortable doing that many things but I know that if each of us will try to do something which will help fiverr that will be only good for all of us. Sorry if I write anything wrong or anyhow you can think I offend in any case please don’t take this personal I just speak in general it’s about my feelings and thoughts which I follow, you can give me your opinion and I can learn from it much, thank you and stay safe we all should try to pass through this with understanding and compassion to each other stay safe",,"Mar 27, 2020 6:47 pm",2020-09-09 20:28:52.967382

What do you think guys??",,1.0,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,9.0,"First of all, Please accept my deepest condolence. Recently, Armenia reports first death related to coronavirus which is pretty sad
You’re right, If I’m not getting any orders then there is something wrong with me. Maybe my gigs, images, title, keywords & my skills are not not working for me. I will change them & improve my gigs & skills soon. But please note: I’m not bashing Fiverr here & I’m not complaining about not getting orders
I started this discussion to verify that if (COVID-19) is the reason for not getting any sales right now. And yes I was right. (This Coronavirus pandemic changed the world including Fiverr) Usually I receive 5-6 messages per day or sometimes 2-3 orders a day. But from last 26 days, No one is contacting me & no one is ordering my gigs which was pretty strange for me that’s why I started this.
Repeat customers are the reason of my survival on Fiverr. I’m a seller here for more than 6 years now so yeah I know what I’m doing here. I often advertise & promote my gigs on different platforms & yes on on my social media accounts as well. I even have a “Marketing budget” for my gigs. Yes, I usually invest my 20% earning on advertising which is essential for my online business. When I’ve started in 2014 the competition for me was not that strong. Yes “My Main Job was to speed up wordpress sites much faster” & that time no one was competing with me.
You can go to Fiverr & just search this: wordpress speed optimization (You will find 100+ gigs about speed optimization) Yeah exactly like the logo ones. Everyone is a expert in this field now I’m talking about wordpress speed optimization here.
2014 (When I was just 18-19 years old kid) 2020 (When I’m 24 right now & much for experienced & professional)
So yeah I improved a lot & yes even my personal life is changed now
I stopped working here for more than 2 years because of some personal reasons but when I started again in 2019 everything about this marketplace was changed. Fiverr PRO area, You can take skills & other tests. So I was happy that they’re improving this marketplace but then I activated the paused gigs & realized that no one is messaging me. I searched my gigs & found out that every other seller is offering my services, which was just shocking for me. I invested my time & money on my profile & then orders start coming again. I even messaged my previous buyers so they can know that I’m back here
Everything was normal that time then in January 2020 my impressions, views & clicks were decreasing every single day. (Strange) right!!
I contacted Fiverr support & they told me that everything is fine with your account but I still told them to check it again & they replied: Everything is normal but I can feel that everything was not normal that time. February was a pretty good month for me but then this March month destroyed everything
I can’t even express my feelings with you, I’m so sad & worried right now. & please don’t say sorry to me & yeah I don’t take anything personally so don’t worry

No no, Please try to understand that main purpose was to show the impact of the coronavirus on businesses.
To be honest, I am getting sick of people trying to remind me of the impact on businesses. I have a friend who secured the lease on a restaurant just before this. He was due to open in a few days, can’t, and is still contractually obliged to pay $1,200 rent each month for the next year.
I know a couple who own a shop who can’t open and are stuck in a similar boat with no income coming in.
I use a mobile grocer to buy my groceries who is now no longer able to do his rounds, and the last time he was here last week, there was a pretty depressed guy I know asking how many individual eggs he could buy with what change he had.
I live on a street of bar and restaurant workers, none of whom are going to be able to pay their rent very soon. Any who are foreign have also been told that if they do not have jobs or are not economically self sufficient, they will need to go back to their own countries by the government. - Despite the only airport being closed.
Now it seems like every time I come here, I have someone I do not know from Adam asking me to help them out, think of them, or do something to help fight Covid-19 by donating my time or skills for free to nondescript charitable causes.
I’m very sorry that you are experiencing hardship. However, like it or not, nobody here can help. It is really as simple as that and the worst thing you can do is continue going around in circles asking people to care or help. Instead, you need to figure out how to help yourself.

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

I get that. Also, I am sincerely sorry that you are in a tight spot. However, to be very blunt, a lot of people are and things are only going to get worse. In this case, you need to start thinking outside the box.
People and businesses in your area will be struggling right now. Is it possible that you could help by reaching out to them directly and offering budget-friendly wen development,graphic design, or marketing services, even if you outsource some of these?
You would literally just have to send a letters to each one. (No one reads emails, but letters can still work.)
That is just one basic idea that may not be applicable to you at all, but you need to start looking for solutions like that yourself. You could also play ith your pricing a little. Lower the price of your most pricey web design gig, but increase the price of your $10 gigs.
Maybe also re-evaluate your delivery times. No offense, but I don’t believe you can build me a full, fully responsive website in 2-days. Maybe create a 1-day consultation gig or package, and increase delivery time on your web design gig to something like 5-days.
Whatever you do, good luck. However, you really do need to start with you doing something, rather than asking for people to share their excess orders with you. Quite frankly, most people likely don’t have excess orders to start with.",,"Mar 28, 2020 4:21 pm",2020-09-09 20:29:02.065953

It doesn’t matter. Fiverr doesn’t allow sellers contacting buyers after order is done. It takes only one person not to like it and that’s it, best she will get a warning, worst he will loose her account.
In a real world it would’ve been an ok practice however it’s forbidden on fiver. If you want to risk your account - that’s fine, but do not advise others potentially harmful things.

Why are people keep giving this same bad advice while trying to present it as something other than spam? “Oh no, it’s not spam at all, it’s just bothering your recent clients like they can’t reorder a gig themselves if they need anything”.
If you think it’s a clever marketing strategy and it has never backfired on you yet, it’s because you never yet came across a customer who got irritated enough to report you. And something’s telling me that these days when everyone’s counting their money, it’d be easier to irk a person by asking to spend more.

Greetings, you do not need to promote your site and post URL everywhere. talk about it, increase awareness of it and the need for such union. Anyone can build the website, but the whole point is not the traffic or number of members on the site but the act, will and sacrifice for other colleagues.

You really need to think on your execution. You are missing a lot of points. Let’s start with the Non-US. Which counties will that be? Do you realise that NON-US also includes Russia, China, South American countries, Australia and all European countries?
Secondly to operate like that you will need to register yourself with a government under a certain licence. Are you working on registering yourself as a charity? Otherwise your website will be nothing but a scam (even if you don’t think so). You can not register yourself as a sole trader otherwise you will have to pay tax on every donation you get as on normal income. If you are not planning to register yourself then again it will be illegal. + all the points that @jonbaas added.
It might be noble what you are thinking to do but it looks like you are not even realising what work will stand behind that and what will be the process of registering and running it.
Website is actually only a tool. You thought of how to make a tool but you didn’t think of how to build a “house”. E.g you need to build a house and instead of hiring an architect and designer and create plans of how your house will look like and workers to build it, you instead of that hired people to create a hammer because you think the hammer is what will build you a house.

Because we don’t have it, We don’t have any security in case of emergencies like (COVID-19) situation right now. Our government is helping businesses, labours, companies but they don’t have any plans for Independent workers.
We’re nothing to them?? You know what In “India” banks don’t give loans to the Freelancers easily. If you have a salary account then the process is easy but for freelancers it’s pretty tough.

I’m that kind of person who don’t even trust such non-profitable or charity organizations.
In all honesty, what credentials do you have to offer that would make people trust YOU to be the organizer for this “freelance union”? How do people who might be interested, know that you aren’t doing this for personal gain, or that there really are funds to be provided? Who are your big-name backers and financial supporters? What security and oversight do you have in mind? What kind of reputation are you building this upon? Have you procured legal standing? Do you have the paperwork that gives your “union” legitimacy? Are you registered in all of the countries you wish to operate?..
If you don’t trust charities, why should someone trust YOU to be a charity and purveyor of funds? (I’m asking, not accusing)

This is the very nature of anyone choosing to be an independent worker. Independence from any corporate banner, and a self-minded approach to offering services is, by nature, supposed to be a risk freelancers take. Smart freelancers plan for tough times. They don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Freelancers are not unionized, or a cooperative venture. Freelancers take on the responsibility to be their own business – to grow their dreams, and become what they want to become. To be successful, means to take on the risk of failure as well. Without the risk of failure, there can be no success.
I admire those who truly wish to help freelancers, but I just don’t think you’re going about it in a reasonable, strategic or cooperative way. A union begins as a group of like-minded tradesmen, it isn’t one person trying to collect money for dubious distribution. I just don’t feel as though you are thinking this all the way through. You have a grand – and noble idea – but no practical execution.",,"Apr 4, 2020 11:00 pm",2020-09-09 20:29:21.908604

It seems to me that you actually build up your plan here in this forum listening to what everybody says.
Just and idea, did you consider to hire professionals to set up such business? This may bring also initial trust level at least.
I am just worried that you want to play a game that may get out of your control soon.
Here’s a recent story from my country.
Our government wanted to spend $15 Mio for e-shop with freeways vignettes.
Web developers community said this amount is ridiculous and offered to make it for 10% of that money.
So they collected 40 specialists to develop and build up the site during weekend hackaton.
This group was so eager to show that they can do it in short time for friction of that money and finally they almost did it.
I say almost because just a few hours later after website was live, the site was broken with loss of personal data, cc data and more. Those were professionals but lack of time and proper planning meant failing.
Just be very careful when you think that you have solution for this and that. Are you really sure about it?

Yes I have a small team & I’m also in contact with many professionals. I even sent many e-mails to different organizations who are working for Independent workers or Freelancers. I want their suggestions, advice & ideas. I’m just a normal person like you so yes I will face many challenges for sure.
Note: Freelancers Union is also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.
Some FAQs: (Let’s talk Legal)
So you will register this (Organization) as a Trade Union?
Maybe. Right now I’m just checking every single aspect because even the official (Freelancers Union) is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers). So they’re just a non-profit organization.
So you will register this as a Non-profit organization?
In my country, you can register a (Non-profit organization or NGO/NPO) in three ways. Trust Registration, Society Registration, Section 8 Company Registration (Earlier known as Section 25 Company)
The type of registration you will need depends on the purpose you want to achieve.
Please note that Society and Trust registration is different from business registration. This is because societies, trusts, and NGOS have charitable objectives. On the other hand, a business works only for profit. Therefore, separate laws govern Society and Trust registration. The only exception is a Section 8 company which is governed by the Companies Act, 2013. These entities receive some special tax exemptions and benefits. These benefits are not available to commercial business setups.
Do you have any business plan?
Yes I have a plan so I can achieve my goals. I’m doing my research right now so I can start this (UNION or Organization) so please make sure that If I start this UNION or NGO/NPO someday then I do have a business plan for it.
Do you have any legal team?
Yes I have a legal team so if I needed any kind of registration then I will contact them for sure. I will pay some huge amount for the registration. Also in case of emergencies the legal representative will help me.
Why Should I Trust You?
I’m just a normal freelancer like you. Recently I started this topic when my sales were dropped dramatically. Everything is normal now, But from that day I decided to do something for my community. Yes, Not just planning or thinking but to execute it properly. I don’t want to waste my time on such questions where people were asking me If I’m doing this for any personal gain. I want to help this community & the Freelancers. Specially the NON-US Freelancers. That’s why I’m planning it & I will execute it for sure.
Maybe not today, Next week or Next month but in next few years. So literally no one can stop me right now. I still remember a reply where someone told me that legal things take time so yeah I will wait until it’s done. I want an organization for (NON-US Freelancers) so I’ll try my best to be 100% legal. Otherwise I will not start this anytime soon.
Why you’re wasting your precious time on such Organization?
I just want to help this community, That’s all I want. Maybe someday we have a Union for NON-US Freelancers & I’m sure everyone wants it so we can help each other
What about funding?
Right now I will spend my own money because I want to start a small organization but yes when our (Organization) will get popular then we will find our supporters. Right now the official (Freelancers Union) has received grants and other support from leading foundations such as the Ford Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, New York Community Trust, United Hospital Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, New York State Health Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, Partnership Fund for New York City, Ira W. De Camp Foundation and others.

What do you think guys??",,1.0,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",leitchsteve,4.0,"Great question!
Things have definitely slowed down in comparison to the last few months and I can only assume it is because of the on-going global pandemic. Try not to stress too much and in the meantime, use this as an opportunity to strengthen and refine your existing brand/image on Fiverr or use it to build a brand new gig altogether.
There is always an opportunity to thrive during times like this but the challenge now is that you need to be extra creative and strategic about your branding, services, customer experience, etc. This is what’s going to set you apart from your competition when the volume of orders is at a low point.
A few key areas that I would personally focus on, if you haven’t already would be: Creating unique and engaging gig images or videos, writing clear and concise gig descriptions, and improving/adding to your existing skillset.
I hope this helps someone!
Best of luck to everyone and remember to be safe,
Steve",,"Apr 6, 2020 9:41 pm",2020-09-09 20:29:25.562595

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.

That’s a funny one you played on Fiverr customer support.
Anyways, even though I believe the Covid-19 posed a serious challenge to the US economy, I still believe their system is quite insulated to a reasonable extent. Most still use ■■■■■, teams, and the likes to further their engagements, hence their need for Fiverr digital services.
You may want to follow the advice of the Customer support, and perhaps, take a few tests to boost your competence in the face of customers.
I wish you all the best✌

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

I finished high school last year and I know how to develop websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am really good at it and I thought this year was my time to put my skills into use.
All over sudden while I was still doing the national examinations, COVID-19 bumped in. My brother is a professional freelance but he started freelancing a decade ago. He told me the challenges I am getting now may be the impacts of COVID-19.
This various came with many negative impacts. Other than killing people it is also killing the economy. Countries like USA that are know to outsource their jobs to third world countries like where I am from are also struggling to secure jobs for themselves. Hopefully all will be well soon.

Thank you for much.
I also want to tell you that two of the sellers cancelled my order for some reason (They ordered the gig without discussing the project and the requirment which was out of my expertise, so they cancelled). Out of two orders Customer support cancelled one of the order on befalf of the buyer due to same circumstances.
Does that affect my gig ranking?
And after all this when I was not getting orders I did some seo and updated my gig category, title and description. But still I’m getting very less impressions around 1.5K and 20 clicks in a week.
I’m little worried and don’t know what to do to get new orders.

Does that affect my gig ranking?
First of all, there is no such thing as “gig ranking”. The Fiverr search system is a dynamic algorithm. It does not rank by popularity, it organizes results differently – for each person – according to value to that specific person. Every person looking at the search results will see a different list of gigs, based upon what Fiverr thinks is important to that person searching the results.
That being said, though, yes, any cancellation is likely to affect how the algorithm sees the value of your gig – insofar as it relates to people searching for it.

I fear nobody can tell you how bad the hit for your ranking might be; some people post that they experience long slump periods after breaks, others say it picks up again soon for them. Chances are that your gig will be de-ranked, as Fiverr wants to show buyers active gigs, obviously, (or even because of normal gig rotation), so I think it’s unprobable that you would continue from the same position if your gig is inactive for two weeks or longer, but how bad it will be/how long it will take to rank higher again, your guess is as good as anybody else’s.
However, half of June is over already, and as you say it was your best month yet, and it’s just two weeks until end of June, and money is the last thing you care for, maybe just do it and take care of your family and yourself those two weeks, especially if a family member is in critical condition, but that’s something you have to decide for yourself.
In any case, though, if you feel you’re having a mental breakdown, press pause ASAP.

COVID being problem is not covid issue, it is human and mentality issue.
90% of what governments are asking to be done people should do on their own, applying simple and basic logic.
The moment there is new unknown disease around that is spread by air and particles everyone should wear mask and wash hands and sterilize equipment they are using. Nothing mayor or drastic in doing that. Simple hygiene.
But people are acting like children, teenagers. Government tells me to do something I will not obey.
COVID is fraud, covid is conspiracy, covid is aliens attack…
When someone has a flu or chicken pocks or lice, some follow the rules of hygiene and some think they are above it and refuse to do normal things (wash hair, clean hands, clean clothes, use lotion, constrain yourself from going in to public areas until you are healed etc etc.).
COVID is causing all these problems not because of itself on its own, the problem is human.
Human that is refusing to behave normally.",,"Sep 2, 2020 7:37 am",2020-09-09 20:31:23.409170

The biggest “concern” I’ve had with my Fiverr orders right now is the prospect of cancellation requests popping up.
Money may have changed for some people / businesses. What was once a priority is perhaps not so much right now whilst this thing goes on.
I have this uncertainty about orders in my queue - Will I get a message from a customer out of no where asking to cancel because of their money woes or because the business side of things is on hold? Will I get several? Should I jump on the orders sooner rather than later or chill out a bit…
It creates a bit of unease for me, doubly so because of the way Fiverr handles cancellations now and obviously because income for a lot of freelancers is volatile currently (more than normal).

Currently I’m on my college spring break, so I’m getting stuff done that I’ve been putting off forever. Plus catching up on my fave Netflix shows like “YOU”, “Lost In Space”, “The Walking Dead” and “American Horror Story 1984”.
Another thing I’ve been doing is… Making my own handsanitizer and organizing my household.
However, with everything going on in the world. I’m still trying to live life, laugh and have a little bit of fun. I don’t want to be a programmed MK Ultra Soldier.

What an interesting time we are in as a global economy. In my neck of the woods on the east coast beaches are closed, stores readily running out of supplies, business are shutting down everyday, police are breaking up beach parties, others getting on social media telling their friends to dine out.
Not much of a spread yet but a well know aerospace facility in my town just got a case of covid-19 and havent shut down. That facility employees hundreds of engineers. I live next door to an Airbnb for outatowners only. I don’t understand why people are traveling out of state/country right now. I’m afraid many are not taking this virus seriously.

No, I can assure you, they are not. Just because you feel that way (and I’m sad to hear that this is your experience), does not mean all Fiverr buyers are quaking in their boots. The clients I have been working for, for example, are taking current events in stride, and pursuing projects that they need to finish. None of them have expressed fear to me over the coronavirus.

I would like the community to come together and arrange for me and my dog and possibly my girlfriend to be airlifted immediately to Pitcairn Island.
Thank you for the kind offer.
More seriously, I’d really like Fiverr to maybe go with @eoinfinnegan’s earlier suggestion of Fiverr relaxing St. Levels and maybe putting some UI tweaks in place to make sellers’ lives easier.
I’ve been bombed bya client repeatedly ordering in bulk from my single article gig with 1-day delivery, despite me asking him numerous times to message me before placing bulk orders. I’ve finally lost it and just canceled his last order. However, my stats will likely be ruined soon anyway.
The thing is, this wouldn’t happen if we had a feature to limit how many of a certain gig package a single buyer can buy at a time.
Another thing that would make life easier is a 24-hour or 48-hour auto-accept feature for disputes. I got bombed yesterday with lots of people who aren’t replying to extension requests, likely because it is the weekend and they are doing what normies do and are taking time out until Monday.
And would it really be so hard to darken and increase the font size of the fonts in messages, order requirements, and custom offers? - Or let sellers customize this?",,"Mar 21, 2020 5:53 pm",2020-09-09 20:36:47.196204

This! Even a 3/4 day long or something would be better than the current Buyers can just disappear situation. I have a $550 order with a client who has disappeared for two weeks after we had extended the delivery a couple of times (order placed over 2 months ago) while waiting for them for other reasons. There is still some parts of the order to complete which she has said she wants to give input to but hasn’t done so meaning I can’t just push ahead with it.
Meanwhile, it looks like I have an order which is 16 days late and technically the client could cancel it and get refunded at any point as I can’t do an extension without her agreement…",,"Mar 21, 2020 8:18 pm",2020-09-09 20:36:48.328925

Many have lost their jobs and self-employed workers are the ones who are suffering a severe blow, economically speaking. Fortunately, I am doing fine. The company I work for allows smart-working and when I don’t work, I have online lessons and dedicate myself to freelancing ( well, and Netflix too). I’ve noticed that several other companies are demanding for people to work remotely.

This is getting ridiculous if I’m honest.
On my island, we have had no cases but 1 that was sent to the mainland. The only way to get here is by ferry. All businesses are closed and already people are losing their jobs and can’t pay their bills. It would be easy to prohibit passengers on the ferry and just use the service for goods. This way, life here could continue as something like normal and small businesses would at least stand a chance.
Instead, tourists can get a 10,000 euro fine for not answering the door when a policeman calls to see if they are obeying by quarantine rules. (This means they press buzzers on apartment main entrances that usually don’t work, and guess what time they call?) Businesses can also get a 3,000 fine for opening and at least one has already been fined for trying to do something productive and having staff on-site doing paintwork and maintenance.
It is all madness.
And if you thought Coronavirus was bad, wait for rat flu!
Mail Online – 24 Mar 20
Man who died on bus in China tests positive for virus RATS spread
The victim died on a vehicle in Shandong as he made his way to work and was found to be suffering from hantavirus, which infected rats spread through bites, droppings, urine and saliva.
Then you have that minor problem that is when economies nosedive, public health goes through the floor. Infant mortality rates go up, life expectancy shortens, violent crime goes up, the rate of people choosing to end it all skyrockets, rates of malnutrition go up, disease spreads more easily as a result, homelessness rates skyrocket…
This isn’t just getting ridiculous, it’s dangerous, and the aftermath of this is going to be catastrophic. .",,"Mar 24, 2020 7:43 pm",2020-09-09 20:36:57.304736

It’s crazy people can’t get tested. We can’t do tele-doctor visits. Not enough masks available for healthcare workers who have to wear two masks, two sets of gloves which they remove the top layer for each patient, etc.
I can’t imagine what our pitiful little local emergency waiting room must be like, parents with screaming babies waiting for hours, homeless people, all sick and coughing, overworked understaffed nurses. Hope I don’t have to find out, in person.
A small ray of hope:
They found the virus doesn’t like hot humid weather, over 63 degrees f. It slows it down.
They also found it does not mutate due to the way it’s put together, unlike the flu, so any vaccine will likely be permanent.
Best hope: a year from now a good vaccine will be available to anyone. And the drug that shows so much promise is widely available to anyone who needs it.

I have no time to watch movies and read books which I love I just spend my time designing my route and planing the deliveries.

Yesterday we had a complete blackout for a while. Between no plumbing and no lights or electricity it was surreal. At least in a cave we could build a fire and use the outside “restroom”.
I found myself yelling out the front door to the neighbors to find out what was happening with the electricity. We aren’t supposed to go outside at all here. I felt like a trapped animal.

To say I’m nervous about how this will all play out is an understatement. As much as I want to get back into the gym or lift weights in the local park, another part of me is saying, this is going to get worse before it gets better.
Last night, instead of attending a concert in Memphis to see Motionless in White, I was at home. The concert was postponed (understandable) and who knows if the concert will even happen. The bright spot of the whole thing is that my school will remain shut down for the rest of the academic year. Now, I do need to go in once a week to get things done such as auditing for next year and payments.
As it stands now, my job is being terminated due to restructuring. I was actually called to ask if I wanted another position in the school as a parapro. While it’s not what I want all the way around, I know I can do the job and will do it as I do anything else in my life. I await the final decision from the board to see if they will make the approval. So, we’ll see!
Thankfully, the Fiverr work has increased, which may be due in part to finding my best gig on page one again with the culmination of an ad I ran.
In the grand scheme of things, I’m just playing the wait and see game and doing work when it comes in.

Since I do reports all the time at work I find it natural to make a report on what I did during quarantine since this is the last Q-day in my country (Croatia). Starting tomorrow business should be slowly returning to normal.
So:
I published 2 new books
I wrote 3 new books and prepared drafts for 12 more
I wrote 5 e-books for students struggling to learn online since schools are closed
I started Fiverr seller account and earned 92 USD
I designed furniture for my backyard and build it together with my crafty neighbor
I repurposed frame of the old trampoline into the gym area
I planted some flowers for the first time in my life
I draw a big “NO SMOKING” sign in my backyard
I started a YouTube channel and helped a kid who was being harassed by others on the live stream
And
I cleaned and organized my office (this lasted for one day and now it is back to random mess)
I discovered there is nothing wrong with my car battery, for some reason car wants to start only if the shift gear is in a certain position
I gain 10 pounds (and then I decided to make gym outside :D)
I actually planted seeds of watermelon next to flowers.

Thank you for the Mexico part. I wish. Then I would know Spanish, my dream language.
I feel sorry for my old self. I had this backyard for 39 years and my day was wake up, go to university, do lectures for 8 hours, then do e-learning for 6 hours, and go to sleep, tomorrow, repeat. Never break, never rest, and the worst part is - nothing, I have nothing from 14 years of that, I worked to buy food and pay bills, the moment I save some money the prices go 30% up. Over and over. All the years of life wasted. I never wanted to invest in the apartment and backyard since it is rented, not mine. I finally got to my senses I need to enjoy in today.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/0/4/e/04e4b0779d0e9a6b38c26c5f727920ee25e3d16d.jpeg,"May 16, 2020 2:53 am",2020-09-09 20:38:10.900354

I’m sorry for your sisters situation. However, she might be lucky if France is still treating oncology patients. In Malta and lots of other countries, most cancer screening and treatment is pretty much on hold at the moment. I have a friend with lung cancer who hasn’t been to the hospital in weeks.

COVID19 is not so dangerous as cancer.
More people have died in building accidents on Malta this year than they have of COVID. However, the constriction industry is the only industry that has been allowed to continue operating as normal throughout the pandemic. Apparently, the cost to the economy would be to great if they ceased operations.
Then you have the suicide rate in the U.S. In some states, they have already recorded more suicides this year than during the entirety on 2019. Sadly, most people aren’t interested in looking at the bigger picture.

Fiverr Staff",289.0,"A letter to the Fiverr community & beyond.
The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times.

Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

I’m not saying Fiverr owes us anything because of Corona – not at all.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.

Actually, there is something Fiverr could do to help its seller freelancer community in a direct and probably not too complicated way (a bit of coding and sending out automated emails, I think).
As it’s possible that some of us may have to apply for government funds or a mortgage respite, prove to their health insurance that they don’t earn much or at all due to this pandemic to not have to keep paying their monthly dues based on last year’s earnings/tax declaration, etc.,
a “paper” (email) from Fiverr stating the seller’s revenue for any given month could be more helpful and get less suspicious looks than that csv file one can download. Staff in such organisations often don’t know much if anything about freelancing or at least platforms like Fiverr/the gig economy, too, and often ask for “something official”.
Something that looks credible and official, with Fiverr’s address and such, that states something like:
XY is registered on our platform as a freelancer and earned $$$ revenue in (February 2020).
I’m sure Fiverr has people who can make sure that that “revenue statement” will be fine from a legal standpoint for Fiverr.
This has been already suggested before COVID-19, as something like that, especially as a yearly statement, would be really useful for tax and other purposes, but I think in the face of the current situation, it might just have become even more relevant.
I hope this can be considered/passed on to the relevant people. Thanks!",,"Mar 20, 2020 12:39 pm",2020-09-09 20:39:21.274453

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

I myself had every intention of going to the gym today but the more the day dragged on, the less I felt up to it. In fact, my sinuses are driving me nuts and my eyes are itchy. I’m pretty sure my allergies are starting to flare up. I’m not really self-isolating but really just staying to myself. Luckily, I can really rest because I have no work to speak of anymore. I had a large order come in yesterday and it’s already done and sent off to the client.
For now, the rest of the day is mine. Thanks to this virus, the school shut down for a week before spring break (by orders of the governor). I had to go in for a short time to get billing done, but other than that, the day is my own
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.

Pumping out social media posts, videoing children’s church lessons, and writing Bible devotions have been my days outside of the three hours I reserve for my writing orders (thankfully, business is still going strong).

Hope it’s not COVID-19, and something else entirely. Here’s hoping, either way, that you get to feeling better soon.
I’m not too worried about my personal health because if it is COVID-19, at least now I know that it won’t kill me or make me extremely unwell. It honestly feels like that annoying bronchitis that comes after tonsilitis. Irritating and I feel a little rough, but not any worse than a cold. I do however worry about the people I came into contact with before I started presenting symptoms.
emeraldawnn:
Thinking it’s time to clear off my table and do some puzzles myself. I bought myself a puzzle at Christmas and I guess I can start working on it. My son and my son’s friend who lives with us both did their AMI packets for today. So now, they’re just goofing off. With a dreary day like today, I just want to rest more than I do anything else.
Honestly, if it weren’t a worldwide pandemic out there, this almost sounds like an idyllic day. Glad things don’t seem to be too stressful in your family. Get to work on those puzzles!!
graphtersawyer:
I’m absolutely terrified of being sick with anything, so this whole thing has really just made my anxiety skyrocket.
I’m so sorry friend. I’ll be thinking about you and your family. Extremely frustrating when people don’t seem to realize that the spread is totally preventable if we just do the right things
I have OCD (the actual kind) but luckily not related to germs/infection, otherwise I’m sure this would’ve destroyed my mental health. I have a good friend with a dibilitating fear of germs and she is having a really rough time
graphtersawyer:
Does being sick affect your ability to do VO work at all?
Thank god, no. The cough I have is very “chesty” - not mucusy/productive. It feels like my lungs are contracting every 15-20 seconds or so and I have to cough. But I haven’t got a sore throat yet so I can keep churning out work!
lenasemenkova:
No cough, though.
Many people don’t develop a cough. Some people just have a fever, and some people have just the cough. NHS advises anyone with either OR both to self-isolate. Here’s hoping you’ve already had it and now you’re not at risk anymore!! <3",,"Mar 17, 2020 1:21 pm",2020-09-09 20:42:36.461819

To be fair, I’m more concerned about my country collapsing on itself than the dang virus. There are very questionable political decisions being made that have nothing to do with the virus but will without a doubt provoke a strong public response (i.e., massive protests).

Regular",4.0,"Ah, @gwyneth_galvin - sorry to hear this. But glad - in a kinda sardonic way - you’re getting it out of the way early.
My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
Here in Glasgow you cannot get paper goods for love nor money. Soap is in very short supply … but not shampoo for some reason. Shelves and shelves of shampoo and conditioner with no one interested in it. At a pinch, you can use that as shower gel and washing up liquid - it all has the same base, apparently.
Luckily, we’d put some stuff aside for Brexit, which we still have … or at least what’s left of it after Brexit didn’t really happen that much.
And yes, that EFT tapping for increasing lung capacity is a great idea. EFT for anything is a good idea. I have a tapping round for making sure your system is open to accepting everything you do for yourself, which is really useful.
@graphtersawyer - take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.

It’s possible to have a virus or even pneumonia and it doesn’t affect you in a terrible way. (I can’t stand going to a doctor so avoid it as much as possible.)",,"Mar 18, 2020 11:59 am",2020-09-09 20:42:55.293005

UK testing is pretty much non-existent unless you’re in hospital, but I’m 100% sure I have it. Sudden onset persistent, dry cough with pre-flu symptoms? Never experienced that in my life. Would be a mighty coincidence if it’s anything else.
I’m worried for the elderly and high-risk folks in my community, but for myself this has mostly just been a surreal experience more than anything else. I only leave my flat to go for a walk around the block and I keep well away from other people. I’m indoors for 99% of the day. I read the news obsessively to see the status of my home state, where my family still lives. I’ve deep cleaned my flat and watched almost every episode of cold case files.
Thank god we got a nintendo switch as a wedding gift last year and I have a couple jigsaw puzzles arriving in the post soon.

The metrics are still being accrued, they just aren’t being displayed. Gigs have not stopped gaining impressions just because the impressions are not being displayed.
Do you really believe the analytics data is stored correctly everywhere in Fiverr’s databases etc. (eg.in all relevant tables) and that it just can’t show those values?
Don’t you think the analytics page just basically took values that were already stored somewhere (like in fields in a particular table or that could easily be calculated from them) and then displayed them (eg. in the graph/as values)?
It’s not really a “display issue” if it’s wrong in one or more places in the database. The analytics page wouldn’t read through lots of data to show one value to the user as it wouldn’t be efficient.
Why would it take multiple weeks to show a value that is already stored correctly when the code for showing that data in the graph hasn’t really changed? Where’s the difficulty in showing a value that is already stored correctly using the method they already had? And if it was correct everywhere in the database, why was it only recent days’ values that started being shown as 0 when the previous days were being shown correctly (before they changed everything to show “N/A”).
It’s obviously stored wrong somewhere (if stored at all in that place) in the database and that was what was getting displayed before they changed it to show “N/A”. And they’re obviously trying to fix the values somewhere in the database (even if it’s right somewhere else) or get it to start writing the values correctly somewhere in the database for a seller’s analytics figures (eg. daily/weekly/monthly totals).",,"Jun 11, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:16.356871

And yes the numbers (such as daily/weekly/monthly totals) for things like clicks or conversions might get used by the algorithms(s) used by the search engine. And if some of them are wrong (incorrectly totalled for some, no values or zero values for others), then it could potentially affect the Fiverr search engine results. It’s more likely those totals could be used by the search engine than individual records of a click/view for a gig at a particular date & time.",,"Jun 11, 2020 2:47 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:17.153889

I don’t think Fiverr is giving a full enough version of what is actually happening by saying what they have. They’re saying it’s a “display issue” just so it doesn’t seem that big of an issue - but it’s taken weeks to try and fix and the last post in the “N/A” thread says it will still be a few more weeks. Values might be getting stored in one place but not in the place needed by the gigs screen - it’s not stored correctly in the place in the database that that gigs screen reads (eg. the totals - and that could effect other things like the search engine if that also reads those totals).
It’s obviously not just a “display issue”. It must be stored incorrectly somewhere for it to have shown it incorrectly like they did. Like I said, it would be too inefficient for it to be reading lots of records before showing the monthly/weekly/daily totals for each gig (in the “gigs” page) so it’s very unlikely to be doing that (it would have to keep re-reading all those tons of records each time you reloaded the page) - instead it will have been using stored values - and they will have recently (before the “N/A” change) been incorrect (or not set).
Fiverr haven’t said what exactly has caused this or whether those values/totals for clicks/views etc. for gigs are correct in every place in the database(s) or anywhere else they’re stored - or explained why a piece of code that was displaying the values suddenly stopped working (what changed apart from the stored data that was used by that code?).",,"Jun 11, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:18.295325

They have told us what we need to know. Nothing is stopping any seller from earning sales. And, as is often said on this forum, earning sales is an issue of seller self-responsibility, not waiting around for Fiverr to provide sales. We know what we need to know. Fiverr – or any Fiverr display error – is not keeping anyone from being responsible and earning their success.

So since Fiverr haven’t given us a full enough story about what has happened and whether the data is correct in every place in the database(s) etc. we can’t really continue saying that it’s being stored correctly (at least not everywhere).
If it was being stored correctly everywhere, how long really would it take to display that value on screen?

Yes but Fiverr should really be open enough about the issue, especially if people are going to repeat what they say as though all values are correctly stored everywhere (which, if that was true, it would surely be easy to display it).

I promise you fiverr knows our stats.
So you promise the stats are stored/totalled correctly everywhere in the database(s) where the fields for them are? Including in the place in the db that the “gigs” page looks for them?
And don’t you think that it’s implied that they’re stored correctly everywhere necessary by “and all the metrics are calculated as usual.” - when surely that can’t actually be the case. They can’t be calculated & stored correctly everywhere necessary if the gigs screen was showing the more recent ones as “0” (when the code to display the more recent days figures would have been exactly the same as the less recent ones - if everything was correct & the stored the same in the db as it usually was).",,"Jun 11, 2020 6:10 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:24.294755

I should be able to ask, if they don’t want to review than that’s a different thing.
By the way, I just say “please don’t forget to review” you shouldn’t say “give me 5 start review” that will definitely put you on radar.
