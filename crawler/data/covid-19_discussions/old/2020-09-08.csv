Two former co-workers of mine have died from COVID. One was 33 and died in a week after starting to exhibit symptoms. Another one was 41 and died in around a month. We weren’t close and haven’t talked in years.
I believe there is a penalty of roughly $1500 for not wearing a mask in a “public place” where I live. People don’t seem to care, everyone just carries a mask in their pocket or under their jaw to quickly put it on if the police come.

But in outdoor public places wearing masks is not compulsory anymore at the moment (it used to be obligatory during lockdown, but right now we are only advised to do so).
Personally I think it’s always a good idea to wear a mask whenever a 2-metre social distance can’t be maintained. Equally important is hand hygiene. I carry my hand sanitiser whenever I am out in public, and as soon as I’m back home I wash my hands with soap.

Fortunately nobody I know in person has been infected.
I wear masks pretty much at all times, but due to the recent heat, when I walk to the station I use a quiet route with less people and I hold the mask in my hand. As I get closer to the station I will put it back on.
I see people walking on quiet/empty streets without masks, but in most cases I can
see them wearing it around their chin, hold it in their pockets, or in their hands.
I’m assuming they will put it back on once they reach a more crowded area.
I’d say 99.8% of everyone I see on the train are wearing masks.
We’re not forced, but since wearing masks in public was a very normal thing for us way before the covid, I guess we don’t have that much problems.

Plus freelancing can sometimes be monotonous. Yes you will have flexibility, but working alone without any social contacts may lead to anxiety, mental illness and even it may affect your physical health.
I personally prefer freelancing since it gives me the chance to expand my skills by tackling different projects and working with different clients. Who you work for also determines your success.
If you have a good boss, you are most likely to become really good at what you do. Freelancing will give me the opportunity to work for different clients and satisfy different needs.

I believe the gig economy will only increase further, regardless of any COVID cure. This trend had already begun long before the pandemic – years in fact. Fiverr was created in 2010, and freelancing was already a rising trend. I, myself, joined this site in 2014, and freelancing was very strong back then. The trend did not start with the pandemic, and it won’t end with a cure.

6 Ways COVID-19 is Changing the Tech Industry (& Our Lives),COVID-19 Discussions,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/6-ways-covid-19-is-changing-the-tech-industry-our-lives/497655,N/A,dmaxstudio,,"1. Virtual Tools Are Now the Norm for Everyday Life
Over the past several months, families went from typical public school attenders to home-schooling households. It’s a major shift, but a necessary one to keep little ones safe. This is all made possible with online schooling using tablets and laptops.
At the same time, consumers are changing how they’re engaging with businesses. Take, for example, banking — apps and AI tools are being promoted heavily by financial institutions to cut down on in-person visits and prevent bottlenecks in their phone lines.
Now, there’s an adoption of touchless biometric tech for customers to check out with. Soon, eye scanners may begin replacing fingerprint and chip card readers.
But what’s most notable is how people now work. Roughly 50% of Americans are currently working from home full-time. Anyone who doesn’t perform manual labor is now operating from their home office, dining room table, or patio. Thanks to tech companies like Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Asana, these companies were able to transition their workforce into a remote staff.
2. Telehealth Platforms Take Over the Health Industry
Patients who don’t need emergency medical care are finding themselves face-to-face with their physicians via webcam. Telehealth platforms are making it possible for doctors and their patients to continue their visits without exploiting themselves to possible COVID-19 infection.
This includes various medical industries, such as physical therapy, primary care, and psychiatric therapy.
Having sessions from the comfort of your couch could become the preferred method in the future.
3. Tracking Tools Will Diminish Individual Privacy
Contact tracing — it’s the phrase of the new decade, thanks to COVID-19. And because of it, individuals may lose more privacy than they’re comfortable with.
In case you haven’t heard — contact tracing is the government’s attempt to put together a task force (and apps) to keep track of who interacts with who. All in the name of hunting down who may have been exposed to those infected by CV-19.
Smartphones will be the main source of this information, and tech companies are jumping on the gravy boat. Companies like Safer and SwipedOn already have smartphone apps ready to go for business use.
4. Virtual Reality Becomes a Necessity (vs. a Luxury)
The emergence of VR technology was long-awaited by older generations who grew up watching sci-fi movies like Total Recall and Demolition Man.
Now that it’s here, it’s become a luxury tool to enjoy video games, movies, and social interactions in a whole new way. But now, with a pandemic at everyone’s doorstep, virtual reality is becoming more of a necessity.
Today, VR headsets and AR (augmented reality) are being used to view virtual tours of homes, shop for home goods, and to travel the world (since many are still stuck at home). It’s also being used for education, medical care, and employee training.
5. Drone Deliveries Will Become the Norm
It was always inevitable that drones would one day become the delivery drivers of e-commerce purchases. But it was COVID-19 that sped up the process.
Now, there’s an expectation that federal regulators will streamline the process of delivery drone adoption. Even if it means cutting red tape faster than usual.
These drones will be implemented in lifesaving efforts, which include delivering medicine to the elderly and sick, or even test kits to households.
You can already see drones used for surveillance and monitoring by local police across different counties.
6. Remote Work is Likely to Stay
You have roughly 80% of remote workers saying their happier operating from home. Another 43% are even hoping they can continue working remotely after the pandemic ends.
If businesses pay attention to the needs and demands of their workforce, then you may see remote work here for the long-term.
The paradigm is also shifting for small business owners and entrepreneurs. Those in need of workers who are affordable and flexible are using platforms like Fiverr to find top talent.
Some are looking for web developers to transform their brick-and-mortars into virtual stores. Others are looking to expand their website services to include chatbots to meet the increasing demand for digital sales, customer service, and tech support.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-09-08 20:27:04.145081

One of my sisters works in customer support and her boss, the giant doofus that he is, kept declining to let people work from home because “it’s not work, it’s a vacation” when pandemic first hit. He was eventually forced to let people stay home but only after subway got closed due to quarantine. And it turned out, the overall productivity went up. Turned out, him running into the room screaming at his employees at random intervals through the day wasn’t that much of a motivator. Funny that.

In my opinion there is a massive difference in the mindsets of people who are genuinely freelance because they choose to be, and those who are freelance because they have to be.
Those who choose to be freelance tend to be good at what they do, dedicated to the task in hand but also quite fun people to be around.
Those who have to be freelance tend to overthink their work (not always a good trait), they tend to be a little nervous and look for any opportunity to secure a permanent job.
I’m in my late 40s so I’ve seen a lot of people with the above characteristics in my working life! In my opinion everything will settle down after a while and return to normal.

Of course, there is the startup, which will either make or break someone. Those that rise to the top will always find a way. Those that fail were either never meant to freelance or do not have the talent.
I know when I hire people on this platform for certain jobs, it creates multiple orders. For example, whiteboard animators: I hire seller, they hire a voice over and maybe even a script writer. At the end, 3 people got a job.
I haven’t written a story in a long time, but when I did and will do again, it involves many sellers. I hire beta reader, editor, proofed, cover designers, etc.

Show results",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:25 am",miiila,5,"Business did fluctuate a bit but not so much more than within a similar time period pre COVID, and I was “busy enough”, also, my prices are very fair, figuring in Fiverr’s cut and all (and buyers who know what they are doing, or Google a bit to see what realistic prices and delivery times for quality work might be, should get to the same conclusion) so, no, I haven’t.
I also have many return and regular customers, and while some were affected due to the nature of their business, others weren’t, or even had more to do, that probably evened it out a bit.
My plan in case I’d have had more free time than I’d have liked for more than a month was actually not to lower my prices but to set up some new gigs and do more “offline” and with my own site.
I guess lowering one’s prices might work in a pinch but if they are already fair or even a bit (or much) lower than they should be, it can be problematic to rise them again when it becomes unsustainable.
In addition to that, I have to pay exactly the same for everything myself, partly even more (groceries have become more expensive), so lowering my own prices while my COL stays the same or is even higher, seems a bad idea, unless I’d not get enough orders as it is.
I’ll be flexible if I have to, but for now, I’m happier with cutting down on my non-essential expenses, doing an order ot two less per week, and having more time for other things than work.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:17 am",2020-09-08 20:27:25.684699

For others, the fear of losing their job , being laid off, or not being able to find work is their biggest source of anxiety.
Even the ones who have been lucky to keep their jobs are finding themselves in a situation where they have to clock in many more hours of work than they used to.

I saw somewhere that Micha Kaufman (sp?) say the overall bottom line has increased on 5r since the C-19.
Apparently, with people working from home, they’re using more and more freelancers to help out. Even though many people in USA were laid off, businesses still need their skills.
Since SB can’t afford full timers, they are turning to part timers, which includes freelancers from all platforms.

I know sellers who are doing just fine during the months of COVID – just as they were before COVID. I know some who are even having fantastic sales levels. I also know some sellers who are seeing a slight drop in sales, but nothing noticeably connected to the global pandemic. And I still see countless new sellers (as I have for years) who have no sales at all because they aren’t doing anything to compete in the marketplace. Sales largely have nothing to do with the coronavirus at all, and everything to do with the seriousness, and the willingness of sellers to be proactive and build their own success – no matter what is happening in the world.
Let’s be mindful that we don’t fall into the trap of always trying to find something else to blame for our lack of success. If your sales aren’t at the level you want them to be, then change your tactics, experiment, find new ways to connect with your target customers.

How would knowing whether other sellers have seen their sales go up, or down over the past few months, help any seller become a better seller here on Fiverr? Everyone’s experience is different. A poll like this is just a random feel-good content-filler. This has been asked many times before, and every time before, it has resulted in information that does not help any seller become a better seller.
It shouldn’t matter how well other sellers are doing. What matters is how each seller chooses to focus on their own goals, and build their own sales success. We are all independent sellers here.

If your theory is right I hope that they fire the dude who suggested this idea. A lot of sellers who were working hard and building their profiles providing amazing services are not getting any orders now since the beginning of May and their gigs are nowhere to be seen and some of them commented in the Forum that they will start to look for alternatives because having zero control over your gig ranking is discouraging. Imagine doing everything perfect - Solid amount of sells, competitive prices, unique service, professional looking gig with a perfect rating and then losing everything overnight without a real reason with 0 certainty if you’re going to ever get your ranking back after all of the hard work to make everything perfect to stay on the spot that you just lost.
