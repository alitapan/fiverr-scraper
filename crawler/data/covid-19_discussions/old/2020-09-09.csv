I joined Fiverr during the pandemic mostly out of curiosity, I already had a good enough career in freelancing as a writer offline( nothing big just good enough for a student) but on joining the Fiverr community I came to a shocking realisation!
It really wasn’t easy getting people to notice and trust your gigs. It was also almost impossible to get my offline clients to join Fiverr and order my services.
So I’m mostly working on convincing my clients to join Fiverr (because I feel it’s safer ) and also get people to actually order my gigs😆. It’s not been easy but I have a whole lockdown to keep trying!",N/A,"Sep 8, 2020 5:16 pm",2020-09-09 20:27:53.682614

In the USA, we tip for just about everything: cab drivers, delivery people (except mail), housekeepers, bartenders, even cashiers at fast food joints may have a tip jar.
Far as I know, 5r is the only freelance site with an aggressive tipping feature. You feel like a cheapskate scumbag when not able to tip.
Some countries have no gratuity, therefore confused when pushed to do so after closing an order. I used to like tipping on a “good deal” order but I feel like the push-iness of it is a real turn off.

Then price your gigs 20% higher. You are a freelancer. You decide your own pricing. Besides, 20% isn’t a lot. Many other platforms where you can sell products or services online charge much more. I sell on Steam, who takes 30% of everything I make, and I also earn quite a bit of money on YouTube, who is estimated to take around 50% or more. You get put in front of an audience of more than a million potential customers for only 20% of your earnings. I think that is a good deal.
Also, who is “most of us”? Do you know for sure that you are speaking for a majority of the users?
coolbrains:
but some buyer’s budget doesn’t worth it.
Then say no to that work. You do not have to accept every single offer. Again, put your prices higher, and you won’t feel like you are wasting your time.
coolbrains:
but you would definitely have it in mind if the buyer would give you a tip or not.
No, I never think about tips ever. It is always a surprise when it happens. I am happy with my pricing (otherwise, I would change it), and I never expect my customers to leave a tip - they do not have to pay a penny more for my services than what I charge.",N/A,"Sep 8, 2020 10:52 am",2020-09-09 20:28:02.010456

Well, I’m happy for you. Some sellers on Fiverr here don’t have any other source of income. They only depend on their earnings on Fiverr. Just like me. We are just starting. 20% isn’t much anyways, but well, it’s more than Tithe What I was trying to say is ‘there are jobs you would want to do at a price you aren’t okay with. Meanwhile your target is to satisfy them, get the review, and build up your account’. So this way, you will want to accept the job at their price.

And because of pandemic there isn’t much to do now it’s time to hold and rethink our actions, if you don’t have orders you can always sharpen your skills, I don’t like your sarcastic notice about fiverr’s answer, as fiverr do a lot to make this platform best possible place for all of us by promoting and attracting as many customers as it’s possible. So what we do with our work to support fiverr’s growth? I can’t understand people who think that fiverr owe them anything. Can I ask you why you don’t have buyers? Why you don’t make them return? You need to provide the best possible work to make them forget about other places, you must give them quality that they will not get in other places I’m not speaking about price believe me if you have money you will buy a Porsche rather than Fiat if you know what I mean so every customer ready to pay for a good product as they understand that with that they will look better and can success, every time lowering prices and giving even low quality product isn’t the way we should try to keep on fiverr. I recommend to read more and study better to become a better skilled in what you do every time you have a time this is the only way to attract more customers. In these days the whole world is fighting with unseen virus which is not a joke and because of massive isolation it’s very natural that everything will loose the grip and become more slow so imagine if every seller who have a drop on sales will message to fiverr and ask why they aren’t get as many orders as they want? I have printed flyers and hire 2 girls to share them with people I buy a places to make advertisements I go to different forums and workshops I meet people and tell about my business on fiverr I try to advertise as much as I can my gigs. I’m not a specialist in this maybe I do many wrong things but I try at least I don’t seat and ask fiverr to give me a buyers I have a buyers outside of fiverr I invite them I recommend them to use fiverr I’m an artist designer I never do marketing I don’t understand much and it costs me a lot of energy and I feel not comfortable doing that many things but I know that if each of us will try to do something which will help fiverr that will be only good for all of us. Sorry if I write anything wrong or anyhow you can think I offend in any case please don’t take this personal I just speak in general it’s about my feelings and thoughts which I follow, you can give me your opinion and I can learn from it much, thank you and stay safe we all should try to pass through this with understanding and compassion to each other stay safe",N/A,"Mar 27, 2020 6:47 pm",2020-09-09 20:28:52.967382

What do you think guys??",N/A,1,"Mar 26, 2020 9:13 pm",wpfalcon,9,"First of all, Please accept my deepest condolence. Recently, Armenia reports first death related to coronavirus which is pretty sad
You’re right, If I’m not getting any orders then there is something wrong with me. Maybe my gigs, images, title, keywords & my skills are not not working for me. I will change them & improve my gigs & skills soon. But please note: I’m not bashing Fiverr here & I’m not complaining about not getting orders
I started this discussion to verify that if (COVID-19) is the reason for not getting any sales right now. And yes I was right. (This Coronavirus pandemic changed the world including Fiverr) Usually I receive 5-6 messages per day or sometimes 2-3 orders a day. But from last 26 days, No one is contacting me & no one is ordering my gigs which was pretty strange for me that’s why I started this.
Repeat customers are the reason of my survival on Fiverr. I’m a seller here for more than 6 years now so yeah I know what I’m doing here. I often advertise & promote my gigs on different platforms & yes on on my social media accounts as well. I even have a “Marketing budget” for my gigs. Yes, I usually invest my 20% earning on advertising which is essential for my online business. When I’ve started in 2014 the competition for me was not that strong. Yes “My Main Job was to speed up wordpress sites much faster” & that time no one was competing with me.
You can go to Fiverr & just search this: wordpress speed optimization (You will find 100+ gigs about speed optimization) Yeah exactly like the logo ones. Everyone is a expert in this field now I’m talking about wordpress speed optimization here.
2014 (When I was just 18-19 years old kid) 2020 (When I’m 24 right now & much for experienced & professional)
So yeah I improved a lot & yes even my personal life is changed now
I stopped working here for more than 2 years because of some personal reasons but when I started again in 2019 everything about this marketplace was changed. Fiverr PRO area, You can take skills & other tests. So I was happy that they’re improving this marketplace but then I activated the paused gigs & realized that no one is messaging me. I searched my gigs & found out that every other seller is offering my services, which was just shocking for me. I invested my time & money on my profile & then orders start coming again. I even messaged my previous buyers so they can know that I’m back here
Everything was normal that time then in January 2020 my impressions, views & clicks were decreasing every single day. (Strange) right!!
I contacted Fiverr support & they told me that everything is fine with your account but I still told them to check it again & they replied: Everything is normal but I can feel that everything was not normal that time. February was a pretty good month for me but then this March month destroyed everything
I can’t even express my feelings with you, I’m so sad & worried right now. & please don’t say sorry to me & yeah I don’t take anything personally so don’t worry

No no, Please try to understand that main purpose was to show the impact of the coronavirus on businesses.
To be honest, I am getting sick of people trying to remind me of the impact on businesses. I have a friend who secured the lease on a restaurant just before this. He was due to open in a few days, can’t, and is still contractually obliged to pay $1,200 rent each month for the next year.
I know a couple who own a shop who can’t open and are stuck in a similar boat with no income coming in.
I use a mobile grocer to buy my groceries who is now no longer able to do his rounds, and the last time he was here last week, there was a pretty depressed guy I know asking how many individual eggs he could buy with what change he had.
I live on a street of bar and restaurant workers, none of whom are going to be able to pay their rent very soon. Any who are foreign have also been told that if they do not have jobs or are not economically self sufficient, they will need to go back to their own countries by the government. - Despite the only airport being closed.
Now it seems like every time I come here, I have someone I do not know from Adam asking me to help them out, think of them, or do something to help fight Covid-19 by donating my time or skills for free to nondescript charitable causes.
I’m very sorry that you are experiencing hardship. However, like it or not, nobody here can help. It is really as simple as that and the worst thing you can do is continue going around in circles asking people to care or help. Instead, you need to figure out how to help yourself.
Sorry to be brutal, but that’s the way it is. .",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 3:49 pm",2020-09-09 20:28:59.259351

For me this adds to the overall sense of doom despair and utter hopelessness when I read these. Fiverr is a place of professionals, or it is supposed to be at least. It makes me feel nauseated to read posts saying sellers should help other sellers and buy their gigs just to help them.

I get that. Also, I am sincerely sorry that you are in a tight spot. However, to be very blunt, a lot of people are and things are only going to get worse. In this case, you need to start thinking outside the box.
People and businesses in your area will be struggling right now. Is it possible that you could help by reaching out to them directly and offering budget-friendly wen development,graphic design, or marketing services, even if you outsource some of these?
You would literally just have to send a letters to each one. (No one reads emails, but letters can still work.)
That is just one basic idea that may not be applicable to you at all, but you need to start looking for solutions like that yourself. You could also play ith your pricing a little. Lower the price of your most pricey web design gig, but increase the price of your $10 gigs.
Maybe also re-evaluate your delivery times. No offense, but I don’t believe you can build me a full, fully responsive website in 2-days. Maybe create a 1-day consultation gig or package, and increase delivery time on your web design gig to something like 5-days.
Whatever you do, good luck. However, you really do need to start with you doing something, rather than asking for people to share their excess orders with you. Quite frankly, most people likely don’t have excess orders to start with.",N/A,"Mar 28, 2020 4:21 pm",2020-09-09 20:29:02.065953

It doesn’t matter. Fiverr doesn’t allow sellers contacting buyers after order is done. It takes only one person not to like it and that’s it, best she will get a warning, worst he will loose her account.
In a real world it would’ve been an ok practice however it’s forbidden on fiver. If you want to risk your account - that’s fine, but do not advise others potentially harmful things.

Why are people keep giving this same bad advice while trying to present it as something other than spam? “Oh no, it’s not spam at all, it’s just bothering your recent clients like they can’t reorder a gig themselves if they need anything”.

Actually I respect them & that’s why I decided to stay quite until it’s done. Yes my (2 day launch) idea was bad because my friends told me that we can’t publish this huge site in just next few days. Yes, I decided to launch that campaign in next 15 days. Where me & you will help (NON-US Freelancers) in need.
I will advertise it on Google ads, Facebook & other social media channels. I don’t have enough budget right now but I can assure you that we will start this (Relief fund) even without any enough resources.
In next few months NON-US freelancer can create an account & start their own Unions. I will start my own Forum for freelancers & a Huge NON-US Freelancers Union website. 100 & 100 of pages, Forum, Support, Blog, Donate now & other things included.
What Fiverr team told me:
Greetings, you do not need to promote your site and post URL everywhere. talk about it, increase awareness of it and the need for such union. Anyone can build the website, but the whole point is not the traffic or number of members on the site but the act, will and sacrifice for other colleagues.

If you’re a NON-US Freelancer who wants some financial help then you will go the website & fill some kind of form where you will provide all the details, reason etc…
You really need to think on your execution. You are missing a lot of points. Let’s start with the Non-US. Which counties will that be? Do you realise that NON-US also includes Russia, China, South American countries, Australia and all European countries?
Secondly to operate like that you will need to register yourself with a government under a certain licence. Are you working on registering yourself as a charity? Otherwise your website will be nothing but a scam (even if you don’t think so). You can not register yourself as a sole trader otherwise you will have to pay tax on every donation you get as on normal income. If you are not planning to register yourself then again it will be illegal. + all the points that @jonbaas added.
It might be noble what you are thinking to do but it looks like you are not even realising what work will stand behind that and what will be the process of registering and running it.
Website is actually only a tool. You thought of how to make a tool but you didn’t think of how to build a “house”. E.g you need to build a house and instead of hiring an architect and designer and create plans of how your house will look like and workers to build it, you instead of that hired people to create a hammer because you think the hammer is what will build you a house.

In all honesty, what credentials do you have to offer that would make people trust YOU to be the organizer for this “freelance union”?

This is the very nature of anyone choosing to be an independent worker. Independence from any corporate banner, and a self-minded approach to offering services is, by nature, supposed to be a risk freelancers take. Smart freelancers plan for tough times. They don’t put all their eggs in one basket. Freelancers are not unionized, or a cooperative venture. Freelancers take on the responsibility to be their own business – to grow their dreams, and become what they want to become. To be successful, means to take on the risk of failure as well. Without the risk of failure, there can be no success.
I admire those who truly wish to help freelancers, but I just don’t think you’re going about it in a reasonable, strategic or cooperative way. A union begins as a group of like-minded tradesmen, it isn’t one person trying to collect money for dubious distribution. I just don’t feel as though you are thinking this all the way through.

Our government wanted to spend $15 Mio for e-shop with freeways vignettes.
Web developers community said this amount is ridiculous and offered to make it for 10% of that money.
So they collected 40 specialists to develop and build up the site during weekend hackaton.
This group was so eager to show that they can do it in short time for friction of that money and finally they almost did it.
I say almost because just a few hours later after website was live, the site was broken with loss of personal data, cc data and more. Those were professionals but lack of time and proper planning meant failing.

Yes I have a small team & I’m also in contact with many professionals. I even sent many e-mails to different organizations who are working for Independent workers or Freelancers. I want their suggestions, advice & ideas. I’m just a normal person like you so yes I will face many challenges for sure.
Note: Freelancers Union is also started with just few members and goals to change something in the world of freelancing.
Some FAQs: (Let’s talk Legal)
So you will register this (Organization) as a Trade Union?
Maybe. Right now I’m just checking every single aspect because even the official (Freelancers Union) is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers). So they’re just a non-profit organization.
So you will register this as a Non-profit organization?
In my country, you can register a (Non-profit organization or NGO/NPO) in three ways. Trust Registration, Society Registration, Section 8 Company Registration (Earlier known as Section 25 Company)
The type of registration you will need depends on the purpose you want to achieve.
Please note that Society and Trust registration is different from business registration. This is because societies, trusts, and NGOS have charitable objectives. On the other hand, a business works only for profit. Therefore, separate laws govern Society and Trust registration. The only exception is a Section 8 company which is governed by the Companies Act, 2013. These entities receive some special tax exemptions and benefits. These benefits are not available to commercial business setups.
Do you have any business plan?
Yes I have a plan so I can achieve my goals. I’m doing my research right now so I can start this (UNION or Organization) so please make sure that If I start this UNION or NGO/NPO someday then I do have a business plan for it.
Do you have any legal team?
Yes I have a legal team so if I needed any kind of registration then I will contact them for sure. I will pay some huge amount for the registration. Also in case of emergencies the legal representative will help me.
Why Should I Trust You?
I’m just a normal freelancer like you. Recently I started this topic when my sales were dropped dramatically. Everything is normal now, But from that day I decided to do something for my community. Yes, Not just planning or thinking but to execute it properly. I don’t want to waste my time on such questions where people were asking me If I’m doing this for any personal gain. I want to help this community & the Freelancers. Specially the NON-US Freelancers. That’s why I’m planning it & I will execute it for sure.
Maybe not today, Next week or Next month but in next few years. So literally no one can stop me right now. I still remember a reply where someone told me that legal things take time so yeah I will wait until it’s done. I want an organization for (NON-US Freelancers) so I’ll try my best to be 100% legal. Otherwise I will not start this anytime soon.
Why you’re wasting your precious time on such Organization?
I just want to help this community, That’s all I want. Maybe someday we have a Union for NON-US Freelancers & I’m sure everyone wants it so we can help each other
What about funding?
Right now I will spend my own money because I want to start a small organization but yes when our (Organization) will get popular then we will find our supporters. Right now the official (Freelancers Union) has received grants and other support from leading foundations such as the Ford Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, New York Community Trust, United Hospital Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, New York State Health Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, Partnership Fund for New York City, Ira W. De Camp Foundation and others.

Things have definitely slowed down in comparison to the last few months and I can only assume it is because of the on-going global pandemic. Try not to stress too much and in the meantime, use this as an opportunity to strengthen and refine your existing brand/image on Fiverr or use it to build a brand new gig altogether.
There is always an opportunity to thrive during times like this but the challenge now is that you need to be extra creative and strategic about your branding, services, customer experience, etc. This is what’s going to set you apart from your competition when the volume of orders is at a low point.
A few key areas that I would personally focus on, if you haven’t already would be: Creating unique and engaging gig images or videos, writing clear and concise gig descriptions, and improving/adding to your existing skillset.
I hope this helps someone!
Best of luck to everyone and remember to be safe,

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

That’s a funny one you played on Fiverr customer support.
Anyways, even though I believe the Covid-19 posed a serious challenge to the US economy, I still believe their system is quite insulated to a reasonable extent. Most still use ■■■■■, teams, and the likes to further their engagements, hence their need for Fiverr digital services.
You may want to follow the advice of the Customer support, and perhaps, take a few tests to boost your competence in the face of customers.
I wish you all the best✌

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:

“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.

Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

I finished high school last year and I know how to develop websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am really good at it and I thought this year was my time to put my skills into use.
All over sudden while I was still doing the national examinations, COVID-19 bumped in. My brother is a professional freelance but he started freelancing a decade ago. He told me the challenges I am getting now may be the impacts of COVID-19.
This various came with many negative impacts. Other than killing people it is also killing the economy. Countries like USA that are know to outsource their jobs to third world countries like where I am from are also struggling to secure jobs for themselves. Hopefully all will be well soon.

Does that affect my gig ranking?

Does that affect my gig ranking?
First of all, there is no such thing as “gig ranking”. The Fiverr search system is a dynamic algorithm. It does not rank by popularity, it organizes results differently – for each person – according to value to that specific person. Every person looking at the search results will see a different list of gigs, based upon what Fiverr thinks is important to that person searching the results.
That being said, though, yes, any cancellation is likely to affect how the algorithm sees the value of your gig – insofar as it relates to people searching for it.

Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

I was busy working on my other projects & for sometime I even stopped working on Fiverr but now I’m back here. You guys can discuss with me on any topic & If you like fighting on some topics then try me because I don’t take things personally very easily.
Just kidding
I don’t know why but I’m not getting any orders at all. No messages… Nothing
Maybe Coronavirus is the culprit because mostly all of my buyers are from USA. Recently one buyer told me that work is very very slow here in the US.
Today POTUS (Donald Trump) declares national emergency to combat Coronavirus so I don’t think my sales will get any better in next few days. Recently, I watched this Australian news channel where 2 ladies are fighting for a toilet paper & I was like ***.
I even contacted Fiverr Support team today & they responded:
“Fiverr does not guarantee impressions, clicks or views for your Gig. We provide a marketplace for you to advertise your Gigs, and it is up to you to make them appealing, and promote them outside of Fiverr to increase the number of views your Gig receives.”

I fear nobody can tell you how bad the hit for your ranking might be; some people post that they experience long slump periods after breaks, others say it picks up again soon for them. Chances are that your gig will be de-ranked, as Fiverr wants to show buyers active gigs, obviously, (or even because of normal gig rotation), so I think it’s unprobable that you would continue from the same position if your gig is inactive for two weeks or longer, but how bad it will be/how long it will take to rank higher again, your guess is as good as anybody else’s.
However, half of June is over already, and as you say it was your best month yet, and it’s just two weeks until end of June, and money is the last thing you care for, maybe just do it and take care of your family and yourself those two weeks, especially if a family member is in critical condition, but that’s something you have to decide for yourself.
In any case, though, if you feel you’re having a mental breakdown, press pause ASAP.
All the best to your whole family!",N/A,"Jun 14, 2020 2:15 pm",2020-09-09 20:31:09.032499

All my plans went wrong. I did not get sleep and had a improper food pattern and many other issues…
That time i happened to see some short videos of FRIENDS in Instagram and i started to watch it
Whenever i feel low or facing a deep emotional problem if being alone i began to watch episode.

I really suggest you all to watch friends whenever you had a bad day
you will get 6 friends with values as well as full moreover life seems to be simple every time when i watch it
because sometimes life is not about money fame or anything in this world but our peace of mind
so I recommend my friends to watch FRIENDS SERIES whenever you are having a bad

COVID being problem is not covid issue, it is human and mentality issue.
90% of what governments are asking to be done people should do on their own, applying simple and basic logic.
The moment there is new unknown disease around that is spread by air and particles everyone should wear mask and wash hands and sterilize equipment they are using. Nothing mayor or drastic in doing that. Simple hygiene.
But people are acting like children, teenagers. Government tells me to do something I will not obey.
COVID is fraud, covid is conspiracy, covid is aliens attack…
When someone has a flu or chicken pocks or lice, some follow the rules of hygiene and some think they are above it and refuse to do normal things (wash hair, clean hands, clean clothes, use lotion, constrain yourself from going in to public areas until you are healed etc etc.).
COVID is causing all these problems not because of itself on its own, the problem is human.
Human that is refusing to behave normally.",N/A,"Sep 2, 2020 7:37 am",2020-09-09 20:31:23.409170

@mariashtelle1 is correct… most stores may be out of liquid hand sanitizers, but I’ve been seeing plenty of bar soaps. Those are just as good as liquid hand soap. Heck, dish soap should work too – I wash my hands in our kitchen sink with dish soap all the time.
The point is to wash your hands with soap and water. Soap comes in many formats.
If you can’t find medical face masks, use a bandana or a scarf. The point is to stop YOURSELF from potentially spreading the virus. Medical professionals have been saying that, if necessary, bandanas and scarfs are better than nothing.

Vinegar and lemon juice are antibacterial. Add Tea Tree essential oil, oregano, thyme and even lavender - all of those are antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral.

It’s stressful because the grocery store stopped doing deliveries as they couldn’t cope with the demand.
Yeah, same here. I did some panic shopping on Saturday, asked the delivery guy how they were doing. He assured me things were under control, people’s shopping habits haven’t changed that much and there was no hysteria whatsoever. By Monday the delivery option just magically disappeared from every major grocery store’s website.

You can make your own masks- there are plenty of tutorials on youtube for those with or without sewing machines. It’s easy … but a bit fiddly.
That and clothing brands started selling washable masks. They get a bad rep for being useless but one of my Canadian clients is currently sewing cloth masks for the nurses, and according to the nurses “it does 30% of the job, we’ll take what we can get”.",N/A,"Apr 3, 2020 10:45 am",2020-09-09 20:32:14.326898

Don’t believe everything you read. That article sounds just as a click bait and not like a reliable source. I wouldn’t google to prove if it’s right or wrong but I will give you a couple of question for some critical thinking:
All countries has contracts set up in place on the amount of export and import. Usually they have few chains of suppliers coming from different countries to sustain flow of products in case if there is a political/economical problem with one of the suppliers. That means that they need to honor their deals and they can not just say that let’s say Australia wouldn’t get their groceries (or whatever else) just because China decided to buy it. Everyone has contractual obligations.
However supply chains are indeed suffering right now because this products have never been in such a demand and there was a certain amount of stock produced. When everything suddenly got sold out it still takes tome to produce it. And now it’s not only to produce it but also increase the capacity of your factories to produce higher amount of stock. Which takes time. And we are in the situation where a lot of factories have been stopped not even talking about increasing their production.
I’m sure China is buying a lot but they are also sending a lot of help including physical goods to other countries that need more help.
So I totally wouldn’t take seriously that article. Or I would’ve done the research to confirm that info.",N/A,"Apr 6, 2020 5:43 am",2020-09-09 20:32:17.272941

The impacts are going to be way dipper and extend and after the virus epidemia is done.
I live in one of the countries with highest numbers of sick people but this government handled situation amazingly fast and doing everything to stop the spread. They found all contacts of sick people (which are more than 2000 people that they found and quarantined as a prevention even without symptoms), closed borders (which a lot of people doesn’t like), made it a CRIMINAL offence to withhold information about your whereabouts and your health condition. Your visas will be revoked and you will be deported from the country if you breached home quarantine. Government will pay all your medical bills if you get sick and if you are in official quarantine you will be compensated 100$ for each day.
But there is no point to panic because of this and just to take normal precautions which should’ve been common sense by now, not to sneeze and cough with open mouth, do not spit on the streets, wash your hands and don’t touch your face.

That’s really bad - I know you (Italy) are having a harder time with it than most at the moment.
When reports about it started getting more frequent I noticed Amazon sellers were either selling out or were increasing their prices 30-40%. I used my company account with a medical supply company and bought 2 boxes of masks (300 total) for 10 euro - I’m not particularly concerned but you never know if you/friends/family will need them.

Not entirely correct. Depending on the mask. An N95 disposable mask (or P2 / P3 for European equivilant) do offer a form of protection, but health officials are cautious to recommend them because most people won’t use them properly (fitted flush to the face properly at each use) and they’re not designed for more than short term use. They’re also a little expensive.
A regular surgical mask does give some degree but the main reason is that is helps protect people when touching their face/mouth (which they do some 23-40 times an hour) - Wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission, if nominally, as long as you’re practicing good hand hygeine as well.
As you rightly said, The other benefit is that they also help reduce a person who is infected spreading it further theoretically.

Yes eating bats in a certain Asian country. Apparently they have the virus and it was able to transfer to people.
Bats are one theory, and not an overly realistic one, if you’re following the details of current events (as well as the constantly-changing propaganda coming out of a certain Asian country). Other people seem to present a rather strong case for a more intentional source of the virus – developed in a lab (in the same city the virus was first reported in), and accidentally released into the population.
The fact that the certain Asian country is now trying to blame the USA military as the source of the virus also tends to lend support for the second source story – the laboratory source.
Until that certain Asian nation actually releases factual data, however, no one will know for certain where, and how the virus actually got its start.",N/A,"Mar 13, 2020 11:37 pm",2020-09-09 20:33:31.137596

I bet that cancellation will hurt your order completion rate.
My stats are all 100% but then there are all kinds of invisible metrics we don’t know about.
The entire situation opens endless possibilities for buyers to demand refunds over actual or pretend event cancellations, though. But this is something I’d rather not think about.
If I get any more orders for event promos, I’ll probably be putting together a short disclaimer to please keep checking if an event is still a go and that no refund will be possible if the event is canceled after the delivery. Then watch me get reported for being greedy and heartless in the face of a pandemic
Revenue-wise, I’m one order away from 50% of my monthly income but my inbox is completely dead since Thursday (minus a few orders that were previously agreed upon).

Regular",6,"Throwing in my two cents: Correlation ≠ causation. It’s not the virus itself, it’s the the consequences of fear caused by the virus.
This actually boosts certain types of industries, such as suppliers of emergency goods, while it affects others negatively because consumers are diverting their available funds to those goods, from things of lesser relative importance.
One of my favorite quotes:
Just because you see a turkey flying in a tornado doesn’t mean turkeys can fly.
In other words: just because you’re doing well when there’s a good economy, doesn’t mean you’ll keep doing well if what you offer isn’t a critical-to-survival good/service. I’ll admit I’m exaggerating, but the point stands; people are going to prioritize. This was witnessed during the American Great Depression, and is witnessed any time a noticeable recession occurs in any established economy. Nowadays, being global and digital only means the effects are even more noticed by those who rely on being a global economy like many on Fiverr.
Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.
Many people seem confused by this event, but it’s not a new phenomena. (Remember the H1N1?) Yes, there will be victims (the flu still has more deaths-per-year, thus far). Yes, this is something to be attentive to (though you’d have to be rather socially-starved to be completely out-of-the-loop). Yes, it’s cause to take a few extra steps to be a bit more safe (if an individual isn’t already practicing good hygiene). But this IS. NOT. NEW.
The cancellation of events are for the sake of protecting people from themselves, because people will rationalize that going to a massive gathering is more important than their health AND the health of the people around them. (Like some people rationalize that answering a text is more important than focusing on the road. It doesn’t matter how often ‘nothing’ happens, it only takes one time for disaster to occur.)
I should probably get off the soapbox, though. Not sure how I ended up on it, actually. I was only going to make a short comment.",N/A,"Mar 14, 2020 12:35 pm",2020-09-09 20:33:38.384232

Because I’m an eCommerce product photo editor and image background remover. Most of my clothing brand buyers are importing their dress product from China((COVID-19))! Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos. Though other photo types are going well.

Fiverr puts too much pressure on the sellers. We’re supposed to deliver perfect work, 100% of the time. If the client is not happy, we’re supposed to work with the client until happiness is achieved. It’s all subjective, and we’re not protected.
On Uber, if you show up to a location and the passenger doesn’t show up, you can cancel and collect $3.90. If you pick up the passenger and deliver him, you’re gonna get paid even if he gives you 1 star. You can also get your money right away if you don’t mind paying a 50 cent fee.

This is the conversations category, if you hover it in the category lists, you’ll find that it says that it’s a catch-all for any discussions that don’t fit anywhere else and for non-Fiverr related discussions and “anything else that doesn’t break the forum rules or other community guidelines”.",N/A,"Mar 15, 2020 10:13 am",2020-09-09 20:33:51.126940

I’m curious how much money (per mile) do Uber/Lyft drivers make today? I use to keep up with a few drivers on YT but it’s been a longtime.
What Uber pays per mile depends on where you are in the USA or in the world. In South Florida, we get $0.62 per mile, $0.12 per minute. I think taxi drivers make $1.25 per mile, $0.25 per minute. Uber drivers make more when they drive luxury vehicles, huge minivans, etc. If there are no surges (extra money for increased demand), I will filter towards long rides, and reject short rides (as long as Uber lets me, they can disable that function if you reject too many rides). If there is a surge, I will drive towards it (if it’s close) and go online and accept the first ride I get.
A fellow driver tells me his goal is making $100 in 5 hours. Sometimes that’s possible, other time it’s not. On average, I make $12 to $15 an hour. It’s a job that requires patience because the first hour might be horrible, but on the next hour you might get great surges.",N/A,"Mar 16, 2020 2:30 am",2020-09-09 20:33:56.373209

What people don’t understand, is that the prices paid now in terms of the economy make public health worse long-term.
One minute it’s cool and normal to stockpile sanitizer and toilet paper and close all businesses because of a virus that has negligible effects on 80% of people. However, no one understands that you can only do that once while the economy is as it is. Should a more serious health crisis follow this one, (which diseases do in periods of economic decline) you’re pretty much done for.
After the 2008 financial crisis, this happened in Greece with massive self-death increases (can’t say the S word), and spikes in bygone diseases like Malaria:
Malaria has returned to Greece as financial cuts contribute to the re-emergence of a once extinct disease. … Other mosquito-borne diseases that have slipped back into Greece include West Nile virus. Statistics show that there were 70 instances of mosquito borne diseases in Greece in the first nine months of the year.

Nowadays I think they are in very complex condition. Maybe that’s why the number of new buyer is decreasing! and I’m getting less product photos. Though other photo types are going well.

I’m 23 and I am Quarantining. It’s not an over reaction.
People your age are unlikely to catch covid. Also, most people aren’t self-isolating, Home Depot and local supermarkets have been as busy as ever. In fact, I think some folks are using this opportunity to work on construction projects, gardening, etc.
blavaro:
Furthermore self-quarantine is mainly supposed to stop spreading the infection.
We’ll see if it works. I know kids on Spring Break have been going to the beach even though the governor of Florida closed the beaches. How do you enforce that? Do you put a cop on every beach? It’s very impractical. In California, they expect people to snitch on lawbreakers, good luck with that. Most people mind their own business unless a crime is commited against them.
Besides, how long do you think people can live like this? Who wants to live a life without restaurants, movie theaters, etc? Who wants to cook every meal at home and overpay for toilet paper on eBay?
People talk about the sacrifices civilians made during WW2, but that was different, and those civilians still had access to movies and other entertainments. It was gas that was rationed, people grew victory gardens, and lived with a lot less. Ironically, there was still a black market, people selling counterfeit gas cards, etc.
Now things are pretty crazy. I read that in New Jersey a family got arrested for inviting more than 50 people to a wedding at home.
On the other hand, in Philadelphia they are delaying arrests of those who “commit certain non-violent offenses.” So if someone wants to burglarize homes in Philly, this is the perfect time to do it.
“Due to the confirmed case of #COVID19 from community spread, Salt Lake City Police Department is asking all criminal activities/nefarious behavior to cease until further notice,” the Utah capital’s law enforcement wrote in a tweet. “We appreciate your anticipated cooperation in halting crime & thank criminals in advance.”

The much much much bigger problem will be when basic people instincts and behaviour start playing its role in my opinion.
I believe there will hundreds of thousands infected people in US in next three weeks and then yes, there could be cop on every beach and giving fines to selected ones.

Similarly US had about 40 odd cases a few days ago and now US has more than 22K cases.
This is because the USA is actively and widely testing. There may have been only 40 KNOWN cases, but that doesn’t mean there couldn’t have already been many more at that time.
22,000 cases seems like a large number, however, in a nation of 330 million people, that’s only 0.00006% of the total population, and most of those infected right now have minor/moderate cases that do not require hospitalization.

One fifth of our entire country may need to be hospitalized.
fastcopywriter:
Is it fair to shut down society for the one fifth that are in danger?
It sounds like you can’t grasp the gravity of the situation.
No one has immunity to this disease and it’s impossible to determine who will be able to throw it off like a case of the flu, and who will become more sick.
We now have a U.S. senator who tested positive, and a governor as I recall. Look at what happened to Italy. We unfortunately can expect that here, no reason to believe otherwise. By shutting things down we might be able to “flatten the curve” meaning not have as high a spike before cases start to go down. It’s our best hope.
So far we are a long way from the time when cases will start to go down. I wish everyone could realize the importance of at least keeping a distance between themselves and others, and frequent hand washing.
It’s not just about each of us trying to not get sick. It’s about having it without any symptoms, and going around where others are and spreading it to them. So even if you don’t have symptoms you may put others into danger by coming into close proximity to them. This is a common way people get it.
I want to offer a bit of hope as well as this gloomy report:

Such a perspective shows that if people are not isolated we would simply not have enough ventilators, masks, healthcare workers!!! who could treat the sick people!!!
If we don’t have doctors and ventilators the mortality will raise. Mortality raised already from 3,4% to 4,2% during last two weeks! It is likely this trend is not age dependant but reflects people’s responsibility and self-discipline, resp. lack of it.
It is pity that in our country people still think so selfish these days. So government ordered drone and helicopter surveillance, police gives fines in range of thousand dollars to people who still think they are free to potentially spread the virus.
It is also pity how people in our country wear the masks. Some people spent hundreds of dollars for FFP3 masks and wear it when walking outside with their dogs.

My point is not everyone is susceptible to this disease, not everyone catches it. Right now Home Depot (and other retailers I assume) instituted a rule where the store can’t have more than 100 people inside, including employees. So you can imagine the long lines of people waiting to get in. Ironically, there’s not much social isolation when you’re standing in line, so the measures are futile.
I do hope remdesivir works, I can’t wait to go back to normal. I hope we never again shut down society over a disease.

That’s not right. That’s like waiting two years for a kidney, undergoing dialysis three times a week, and when a kidney is finally available, they give it to a celebrity.
If I show up to the hospital first, I’m supposed to be treated first. What kind of sickos choose who gets to live and who gets to die? If someone dies because all respirators were taken, that’s sad, but at least that person didn’t die because someone deemed him or her unworthy.

Nor did we really know how it would affect the rest of the world or Gig economy workers. Sitting here on March 25th, Sh&T got real! More than 1/3 of the US population is under stay at home orders. It does not mean that everyone is listening. NY is the epicenter of this in the US for now, cases and deaths are rising at record rates each day countrywide - but mainly NY. A sign of things to come in other states is what many seem to wonder. We are still, although better at testing, need more tests to get a read on the entire picture and testing is backlogged, so I do not believe we have the full picture of how this is spreading in places outside of the major epicenters here.
The daily briefings by Governers, especially Cuomo of NY, and that of our commander in Chief are fascinating and taking the place of sporting events I would be watching for entertainment. I will leave that alone for now.
Good news for self-employed Gig workers who are affected by this. Sounds. like they can file for unemployment and get that plus some via this new bailout bill from congress.

Gig workers, freelancers, self-employed are eligible
In an unprecedented move, the stimulus bill expands unemployment protections to gig workers, freelancers and self-employed individuals, who typically don’t qualify for unemployment benefits.
Seth Harris, former Deputy U.S. Secretary of Labor, describes this aspect of the stimulus package as a “gigantic change,” but notes that it could be complicated to execute.
“It will be harder [to calculate] because these workers don’t have a W-2 or an average weekly wage,” Harris says. “These folks have income that varies dramatically from week to week or month to month.”

It depends on the job, if you get paid to talk to people on social media, they’re going to need you everyday.

Then there is the slight problem that when you work from home you degenerate into an overweight blob that lives in less and less underwear every day and panics every time the doorbell rings…
I think that’s a stereotype. Fitness fanatics will join gyms, job, lift weights, etc. Sedentary people will gain weight at home or in the office.
Also, I don’t feel comfortable working in my underwear. I need to wear shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops.",N/A,"Mar 25, 2020 9:55 pm",2020-09-09 20:34:44.613044

Only once three or four weeks ago, I lost track of time since the quarantine began. I don’t think he would have gotten better on his own, the reason he’s in the hospital is because his fever and breathing got a lot worse, and he was feeling really bad. He’s 67, so he’s definitely part of the main demographic for corona.
I’m honestly more concerned about my job. Every time I go to the break room, I’m sitting in places that might have corona. If I push a supermarket cart, that might have corona.

Many people are drowning in the routine of everyday life. Sleep, eat, go to work, watch a movie and sleep again. Now there is time to develop your skills. Time to give life to your ideas.
Therefore, I urge everyone not to lose heart. And start doing things and projects for which you did not have time. Now nothing distracts you. You can completely immerse yourself in creativity.

I bought the game for the art style (which is absolutely gorgeous in all the Thunder Lotus games) but absolutely hated the gameplay on my first playthrough. It kind of grew on me and I love it now. It also feels oddly appropriate for the times.

Now, as far as the Sims 4 goes do you recommend it and why? Try to convince me to play hehehe.
Yes, I definitely recommend it. Why? Because you can control the lives, adventures, careers, families, and stories of digital sims. Your sims can interact with vampires, learn magic, become a college student, have pets, raise children, travel to another planet, and much more. Plus, you can build just about any kind of building, fill it with a wide assortment of furniture and possessions, reshape entire neighborhoods, kill your sim, bring them back to life, visit ancient places… the list goes on.
I especially enjoy the extensive “create-a-sim” feature. It has been a wonderful distraction to the challenges of a hard day. Or, just a great way to have fun and lose track of time.

Money may have changed for some people / businesses. What was once a priority is perhaps not so much right now whilst this thing goes on.
I have this uncertainty about orders in my queue - Will I get a message from a customer out of no where asking to cancel because of their money woes or because the business side of things is on hold? Will I get several? Should I jump on the orders sooner rather than later or chill out a bit…
It creates a bit of unease for me, doubly so because of the way Fiverr handles cancellations now and obviously because income for a lot of freelancers is volatile currently (more than normal).

Plus catching up on my fave Netflix shows like “YOU”, “Lost In Space”, “The Walking Dead” and “American Horror Story 1984”.
Another thing I’ve been doing is… Making my own handsanitizer and organizing my household.
However, with everything going on in the world. I’m still trying to live life, laugh and have a little bit of fun. I don’t want to be a programmed MK Ultra Soldier.

What an interesting time we are in as a global economy. In my neck of the woods on the east coast beaches are closed, stores readily running out of supplies, business are shutting down everyday, police are breaking up beach parties, others getting on social media telling their friends to dine out.
Not much of a spread yet but a well know aerospace facility in my town just got a case of covid-19 and havent shut down. That facility employees hundreds of engineers. I live next door to an Airbnb for outatowners only. I don’t understand why people are traveling out of state/country right now. I’m afraid many are not taking this virus seriously.

The biggest issue as I am sure the news has said is testing. It is so limited right now. To get tested requires so much effort, and as it becomes more available, I am sure the numbers will spike significantly.
Watching how different states handle this vs how the Govt is responding is interesting.

No, I can assure you, they are not. Just because you feel that way (and I’m sad to hear that this is your experience), does not mean all Fiverr buyers are quaking in their boots.
Alas. Your still in the ‘watching Covid-19’ on the news phase. Sadly, things will get a bit more terrifying when you are faced with a $1K fine for stepping outside. Covid-1984 drones are patrolling outside the window and oh yes, everyone is panicking because they can’t afford to pay their bills and have just realized they can’t eat, wear, or make shelter out of toilet paper.

I would like the community to come together and arrange for me and my dog and possibly my girlfriend to be airlifted immediately to Pitcairn Island.
Thank you for the kind offer.
More seriously, I’d really like Fiverr to maybe go with @eoinfinnegan’s earlier suggestion of Fiverr relaxing St. Levels and maybe putting some UI tweaks in place to make sellers’ lives easier.
I’ve been bombed bya client repeatedly ordering in bulk from my single article gig with 1-day delivery, despite me asking him numerous times to message me before placing bulk orders. I’ve finally lost it and just canceled his last order. However, my stats will likely be ruined soon anyway.
The thing is, this wouldn’t happen if we had a feature to limit how many of a certain gig package a single buyer can buy at a time.
Another thing that would make life easier is a 24-hour or 48-hour auto-accept feature for disputes. I got bombed yesterday with lots of people who aren’t replying to extension requests, likely because it is the weekend and they are doing what normies do and are taking time out until Monday.
And would it really be so hard to darken and increase the font size of the fonts in messages, order requirements, and custom offers? - Or let sellers customize this?",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 5:53 pm",2020-09-09 20:36:47.196204

This! Even a 3/4 day long or something would be better than the current Buyers can just disappear situation. I have a $550 order with a client who has disappeared for two weeks after we had extended the delivery a couple of times (order placed over 2 months ago) while waiting for them for other reasons. There is still some parts of the order to complete which she has said she wants to give input to but hasn’t done so meaning I can’t just push ahead with it.
Meanwhile, it looks like I have an order which is 16 days late and technically the client could cancel it and get refunded at any point as I can’t do an extension without her agreement…",N/A,"Mar 21, 2020 8:18 pm",2020-09-09 20:36:48.328925

I come from Italy. As you may have already heard, here the situation is truly tragic, especially in Northern Italy. We’ve been in quarantine for 13 days, all non-essential services are closed, and the military and police officers monitor the cities. Many have lost their jobs and self-employed workers are the ones who are suffering a severe blow, economically speaking. Fortunately, I am doing fine. The company I work for allows smart-working and when I don’t work, I have online lessons and dedicate myself to freelancing ( well, and Netflix too). I’ve noticed that several other companies are demanding for people to work remotely. I imagine that in this tragic scenario the world of work gets adapted to the circumstances and I think this is positive for those who now find it difficult to raise some money.

This is getting ridiculous if I’m honest.
On my island, we have had no cases but 1 that was sent to the mainland. The only way to get here is by ferry. All businesses are closed and already people are losing their jobs and can’t pay their bills. It would be easy to prohibit passengers on the ferry and just use the service for goods. This way, life here could continue as something like normal and small businesses would at least stand a chance.
Instead, tourists can get a 10,000 euro fine for not answering the door when a policeman calls to see if they are obeying by quarantine rules. (This means they press buzzers on apartment main entrances that usually don’t work, and guess what time they call?) Businesses can also get a 3,000 fine for opening and at least one has already been fined for trying to do something productive and having staff on-site doing paintwork and maintenance.
It is all madness.
And if you thought Coronavirus was bad, wait for rat flu!

Man who died on bus in China tests positive for virus RATS spread
The victim died on a vehicle in Shandong as he made his way to work and was found to be suffering from hantavirus, which infected rats spread through bites, droppings, urine and saliva.
Then you have that minor problem that is when economies nosedive, public health goes through the floor. Infant mortality rates go up, life expectancy shortens, violent crime goes up, the rate of people choosing to end it all skyrockets, rates of malnutrition go up, disease spreads more easily as a result, homelessness rates skyrocket…

A small ray of hope:
They found the virus doesn’t like hot humid weather, over 63 degrees f. It slows it down.
They also found it does not mutate due to the way it’s put together, unlike the flu, so any vaccine will likely be permanent.
Best hope: a year from now a good vaccine will be available to anyone. And the drug that shows so much promise is widely available to anyone who needs it.

I try to think of positives that could happen in future, like people’s changed mindset, cleaner water, cleaner air, singing birds, animals re-born, and so on. It makes me feel better than catastrophic future.

We’ve been told that the hospitals have the test but don’t want to use them unless they absolutely have no choice.
In fact, from what I’m hearing, the hospitals are turning people away and not testing those even with outward symptoms of this disease. They just tell them to quarantine themselves and wait for 14 days unless they get worse.

And now I see how many people willing to help and take care about others and keep the rules. This is war and we are fighting with unseen enemy with whole world together this is very unique times we are leaving when you can win the enemy just doing nothing staying at home and keeping all the sanitarian rules when you need to go out. Covid-19 if we can take a look from the other side make us stronger and united we are all human beings no matter where you leave and what is your color we are all humans and this is a good time to stay at home and think about what we do wrong and why we do this with our earth and how we can change. Believe me we can if we stay united there is no need for any disease to make us take care more about our earth I hope this period of time will teach us to be more sensitive about what we do and if everything we are doing is good and brings happiness to others be more kind and compassive to others and nature. Don’t wait just do it make the world better today. I study how to make a medical masks from youtube and make 10-15 masks everyday and after share with old people for free also I try to help my neighbors who leave alone and higher than 60 to keep them stay home. I buy products and leave in the front of doors disinfecting with an alcohol the plastic bags first. I have no time to watch movies and read books which I love I just spend my time designing my route and planing the deliveries.

I’m from India and LIFE IS HARD. For some people being at home is a good thing because they can take a break from that daily hectic life, but for some people, like me, it hard as both my mom and dad are ill and as the only son I have to find a way to make some money. Hence I’m here on Fiverr trying to make some sales. And as a new seller on Fiverr, we all know how hard it is.

I hope everyone here is prepared to stay inside that long. Going any place where there are people puts us at risk. The more people now who are not going out, the sooner our health care systems can find ways to deal with all the patients they have, and the fewer of us will get the virus.
I have food delivered to my home. I only touch the bags with rubber gloves on and I wash all of it. I leave the bags of canned foods without touching them for three days. It can take that long for the virus to die when it’s on bags or other surfaces.
There may come a time when I can no longer get food delivered and I’m sure most people here still need to go out to get food. Please wear a mask or cloth over your nose and mouth when you go out.

We have no working plumbing currently in our ancient house and I’m afraid to let in anyone to fix it since our area is a very high covid area and I don’t want to be around any strangers.
Yesterday we had a complete blackout for a while. Between no plumbing and no lights or electricity it was surreal. At least in a cave we could build a fire and use the outside “restroom”.
I found myself yelling out the front door to the neighbors to find out what was happening with the electricity. We aren’t supposed to go outside at all here. I felt like a trapped animal.

To say I’m nervous about how this will all play out is an understatement. As much as I want to get back into the gym or lift weights in the local park, another part of me is saying, this is going to get worse before it gets better.
Last night, instead of attending a concert in Memphis to see Motionless in White, I was at home. The concert was postponed (understandable) and who knows if the concert will even happen. The bright spot of the whole thing is that my school will remain shut down for the rest of the academic year. Now, I do need to go in once a week to get things done such as auditing for next year and payments.
As it stands now, my job is being terminated due to restructuring. I was actually called to ask if I wanted another position in the school as a parapro. While it’s not what I want all the way around, I know I can do the job and will do it as I do anything else in my life. I await the final decision from the board to see if they will make the approval. So, we’ll see!
Thankfully, the Fiverr work has increased, which may be due in part to finding my best gig on page one again with the culmination of an ad I ran.
In the grand scheme of things, I’m just playing the wait and see game and doing work when it comes in.

Since I do reports all the time at work I find it natural to make a report on what I did during quarantine since this is the last Q-day in my country (Croatia). Starting tomorrow business should be slowly returning to normal.
So:
I published 2 new books
I wrote 3 new books and prepared drafts for 12 more
I wrote 5 e-books for students struggling to learn online since schools are closed
I started Fiverr seller account and earned 92 USD
I designed furniture for my backyard and build it together with my crafty neighbor
I repurposed frame of the old trampoline into the gym area
I planted some flowers for the first time in my life
I draw a big “NO SMOKING” sign in my backyard
I started a YouTube channel and helped a kid who was being harassed by others on the live stream
And
I cleaned and organized my office (this lasted for one day and now it is back to random mess)
I discovered there is nothing wrong with my car battery, for some reason car wants to start only if the shift gear is in a certain position
I gain 10 pounds (and then I decided to make gym outside :D)
I actually planted seeds of watermelon next to flowers.

Thank you for the Mexico part. I wish. Then I would know Spanish, my dream language.

Never break, never rest, and the worst part is - nothing, I have nothing from 14 years of that, I worked to buy food and pay bills, the moment I save some money the prices go 30% up. Over and over. All the years of life wasted. I never wanted to invest in the apartment and backyard since it is rented, not mine.

I saw in Las Vegas they have a huge parking lot with big squares drawn on it each at a distance apart from the others and people laying down on a blanket on the pavement. That is their new home.

I’m sorry for your sisters situation. However, she might be lucky if France is still treating oncology patients. In Malta and lots of other countries, most cancer screening and treatment is pretty much on hold at the moment. I have a friend with lung cancer who hasn’t been to the hospital in weeks.

COVID19 is not so dangerous as cancer.
More people have died in building accidents on Malta this year than they have of COVID. However, the constriction industry is the only industry that has been allowed to continue operating as normal throughout the pandemic. Apparently, the cost to the economy would be to great if they ceased operations.
Then you have the suicide rate in the U.S. In some states, they have already recorded more suicides this year than during the entirety on 2019. Sadly, most people aren’t interested in looking at the bigger picture.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.
Make sure that you continue to follow your local government’s guidance and please stay safe.

I’m not saying Fiverr owes us anything because of Corona – not at all. I’m just saying that if they’re going to essentially brag about the good they’re doing for sellers, they should also address the unfairness that they’ve attached to the selling experience here – stuff we’ve been venting about here and elsewhere for literally years but nothing changes.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.

And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

Actually, there is something Fiverr could do to help its seller freelancer community in a direct and probably not too complicated way (a bit of coding and sending out automated emails, I think).
As it’s possible that some of us may have to apply for government funds or a mortgage respite, prove to their health insurance that they don’t earn much or at all due to this pandemic to not have to keep paying their monthly dues based on last year’s earnings/tax declaration, etc.,
a “paper” (email) from Fiverr stating the seller’s revenue for any given month could be more helpful and get less suspicious looks than that csv file one can download. Staff in such organisations often don’t know much if anything about freelancing or at least platforms like Fiverr/the gig economy, too, and often ask for “something official”.
Something that looks credible and official, with Fiverr’s address and such, that states something like:
XY is registered on our platform as a freelancer and earned $$$ revenue in (February 2020).
I’m sure Fiverr has people who can make sure that that “revenue statement” will be fine from a legal standpoint for Fiverr.
This has been already suggested before COVID-19, as something like that, especially as a yearly statement, would be really useful for tax and other purposes, but I think in the face of the current situation, it might just have become even more relevant.
I hope this can be considered/passed on to the relevant people. Thanks!",N/A,"Mar 20, 2020 12:39 pm",2020-09-09 20:39:21.274453

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online.

In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.

The worst thing about the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus) is the uncertainty that surrounds it. How dangerous is it really? Will it last through the summer? Will there be a vaccine soon?
As the Coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, governments, businesses, and individuals are trying to work out what it means for them, how to protect themselves and how they can help.
In many ways, Fiverr is an embodiment of remote work already. In ordinary times, our community enjoys an engagement that allows them to have freedom over their time and location, but in these uncertain times, it also provides a safer environment to work in.
It is becoming increasingly clear that businesses around the world are likely to be impacted by the changes imposed because of the virus. More people are being instructed to spend less time in public places and more time at home. Despite the uncertainty and restrictions on movement, life and work will and must continue and the Fiverr Community, in particular, are highly accustomed to rapid change with the ability to adjust. And while the long term impact of the virus is hard to predict, in the short term, businesses will have to think about moving the majority of their activity online.
We’ve been thinking about ways in which we can help our community of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) manage in this new environment and decided to put together a new website dedicated to helping SMBs in these uncertain times. You can find the new website at www.SMBhelp.com 379. It will provide guidance, tips, and tools for those who have questions about how to put more of their business online. Here is what you will be able to find on the new website right now: General information regarding the impact of the virus on businesses; General tips on how to take your business online, and if you are already online – how to promote it; Links to products and tools being offered as special deals to SMBs right now by companies around the world; Free courses that Fiverr is donating, and, in addition, we are going to offer 24/7 customer service support team to answer your questions and concerns about your business. We will do our best to help in any way we can. We are in this together and working together makes all of us stronger.
Millions of people around the world are finding themselves in a new business reality, quarantined in their homes or with major travel restrictions, we hope that by offering these resources for free it will create more opportunities for more people, to take their business online, to learn new skills, or to start the business they have been dreaming of.
Lastly, if there are resources you think we should include in the new site, please send them to us or post them on social media using the #SMBhelp hashtag.

As for the specific question of ‘good plan B’, I can say that there has been a huge influx of people thinking the exact same thing. It all depends on if the plan was/is actually a plan and not a whim.
You’ve been here since December, according to your account, so you already know that it’s not as simple as making a gig to make sales. The ‘conditions’ are even more saturated now. Plan B might still work, but it’ll take work, a lot of work, to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.

I have an active account on Fiverr. I have seen a 30% increase in my business during the crisis. People have gone home and now they have time to complete the things they have been too busy to finish. They are less distracted now.
There is economic unrest which will keep some people from paying their bills. You and I just need a small percentage of work from the people who can spend.
The pest control business also suffers during times like this. It’s easy to hold on to cash and be 30 or 60 days behind on paying the pest control bill.

Two former co-workers of mine have died from COVID. One was 33 and died in a week after starting to exhibit symptoms. Another one was 41 and died in around a month. We weren’t close and haven’t talked in years.
I believe there is a penalty of roughly $1500 for not wearing a mask in a “public place” where I live. People don’t seem to care, everyone just carries a mask in their pocket or under their jaw to quickly put it on if the police come.

Personally I think it’s always a good idea to wear a mask whenever a 2-metre social distance can’t be maintained. Equally important is hand hygiene. I carry my hand sanitiser whenever I am out in public, and as soon as I’m back home I wash my hands with soap.

Fortunately nobody I know in person has been infected.
I wear masks pretty much at all times, but due to the recent heat, when I walk to the station I use a quiet route with less people and I hold the mask in my hand. As I get closer to the station I will put it back on.
I see people walking on quiet/empty streets without masks, but in most cases I can
see them wearing it around their chin, hold it in their pockets, or in their hands.
I’m assuming they will put it back on once they reach a more crowded area.
I’d say 99.8% of everyone I see on the train are wearing masks.
We’re not forced, but since wearing masks in public was a very normal thing for us way before the covid, I guess we don’t have that much problems.

My temperature is consistently 35.0 - 35.2 Celcius according to those devices (while the “normal” temperature is 36.5 - 36.8) so it shouldn’t be humanly possible.

The thing is, my temperature is fine, just not according to those machines. It became a running joke at this point as I’m not the only one experiencing it. It’s either no one knows how to use those things and they yank their hand away too fast or what. But it just adds to that bizarre feeling that everyone around me does things that have no point under the guise of “fighting the virus”.

Plus freelancing can sometimes be monotonous. Yes you will have flexibility, but working alone without any social contacts may lead to anxiety, mental illness and even it may affect your physical health.
I personally prefer freelancing since it gives me the chance to expand my skills by tackling different projects and working with different clients. Who you work for also determines your success.
If you have a good boss, you are most likely to become really good at what you do. Freelancing will give me the opportunity to work for different clients and satisfy different needs.

I believe the gig economy will only increase further, regardless of any COVID cure. This trend had already begun long before the pandemic – years in fact. Fiverr was created in 2010, and freelancing was already a rising trend. I, myself, joined this site in 2014, and freelancing was very strong back then. The trend did not start with the pandemic, and it won’t end with a cure. At best, the pandemic is accelerating a trend that was already experiencing a steep rise.",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 3:44 am",2020-09-09 20:40:32.232953

6 Ways COVID-19 is Changing the Tech Industry (& Our Lives),COVID-19 Discussions,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/6-ways-covid-19-is-changing-the-tech-industry-our-lives/497655,N/A,dmaxstudio,,"1. Virtual Tools Are Now the Norm for Everyday Life
Over the past several months, families went from typical public school attenders to home-schooling households. It’s a major shift, but a necessary one to keep little ones safe. This is all made possible with online schooling using tablets and laptops.
At the same time, consumers are changing how they’re engaging with businesses. Take, for example, banking — apps and AI tools are being promoted heavily by financial institutions to cut down on in-person visits and prevent bottlenecks in their phone lines.
Now, there’s an adoption of touchless biometric tech for customers to check out with. Soon, eye scanners may begin replacing fingerprint and chip card readers.
But what’s most notable is how people now work. Roughly 50% of Americans are currently working from home full-time. Anyone who doesn’t perform manual labor is now operating from their home office, dining room table, or patio. Thanks to tech companies like Zoom, GoToMeeting, and Asana, these companies were able to transition their workforce into a remote staff.
2. Telehealth Platforms Take Over the Health Industry
Patients who don’t need emergency medical care are finding themselves face-to-face with their physicians via webcam. Telehealth platforms are making it possible for doctors and their patients to continue their visits without exploiting themselves to possible COVID-19 infection.
This includes various medical industries, such as physical therapy, primary care, and psychiatric therapy.
Having sessions from the comfort of your couch could become the preferred method in the future.
3. Tracking Tools Will Diminish Individual Privacy
Contact tracing — it’s the phrase of the new decade, thanks to COVID-19. And because of it, individuals may lose more privacy than they’re comfortable with.
In case you haven’t heard — contact tracing is the government’s attempt to put together a task force (and apps) to keep track of who interacts with who. All in the name of hunting down who may have been exposed to those infected by CV-19.
Smartphones will be the main source of this information, and tech companies are jumping on the gravy boat. Companies like Safer and SwipedOn already have smartphone apps ready to go for business use.
4. Virtual Reality Becomes a Necessity (vs. a Luxury)
The emergence of VR technology was long-awaited by older generations who grew up watching sci-fi movies like Total Recall and Demolition Man.
Now that it’s here, it’s become a luxury tool to enjoy video games, movies, and social interactions in a whole new way. But now, with a pandemic at everyone’s doorstep, virtual reality is becoming more of a necessity.
Today, VR headsets and AR (augmented reality) are being used to view virtual tours of homes, shop for home goods, and to travel the world (since many are still stuck at home). It’s also being used for education, medical care, and employee training.
5. Drone Deliveries Will Become the Norm
It was always inevitable that drones would one day become the delivery drivers of e-commerce purchases. But it was COVID-19 that sped up the process.
Now, there’s an expectation that federal regulators will streamline the process of delivery drone adoption. Even if it means cutting red tape faster than usual.
These drones will be implemented in lifesaving efforts, which include delivering medicine to the elderly and sick, or even test kits to households.
You can already see drones used for surveillance and monitoring by local police across different counties.
6. Remote Work is Likely to Stay
You have roughly 80% of remote workers saying their happier operating from home. Another 43% are even hoping they can continue working remotely after the pandemic ends.
If businesses pay attention to the needs and demands of their workforce, then you may see remote work here for the long-term.
The paradigm is also shifting for small business owners and entrepreneurs. Those in need of workers who are affordable and flexible are using platforms like Fiverr to find top talent.
Some are looking for web developers to transform their brick-and-mortars into virtual stores. Others are looking to expand their website services to include chatbots to meet the increasing demand for digital sales, customer service, and tech support.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-09-09 20:40:40.943002

He was eventually forced to let people stay home but only after subway got closed due to quarantine. And it turned out, the overall productivity went up. Turned out, him running into the room screaming at his employees at random intervals through the day wasn’t that much of a motivator. Funny that.

In my opinion there is a massive difference in the mindsets of people who are genuinely freelance because they choose to be, and those who are freelance because they have to be.
Those who choose to be freelance tend to be good at what they do, dedicated to the task in hand but also quite fun people to be around.
Those who have to be freelance tend to overthink their work (not always a good trait), they tend to be a little nervous and look for any opportunity to secure a permanent job.

Of course, there is the startup, which will either make or break someone. Those that rise to the top will always find a way. Those that fail were either never meant to freelance or do not have the talent.
I know when I hire people on this platform for certain jobs, it creates multiple orders. For example, whiteboard animators: I hire seller, they hire a voice over and maybe even a script writer. At the end, 3 people got a job.
I haven’t written a story in a long time, but when I did and will do again, it involves many sellers. I hire beta reader, editor, proofed, cover designers, etc.
I am due to retire in about 2 years. I am really looking forward to that date. I can start doing some real freelancing. I want to write more ebook, stories, blogs, etc.
I think 5r is a great place for professional editors, proofreaders, etc. to make a side income. The only thing is no filter for people with no skills.
I’ve found many talented people here that saved me money and also some pretty bad ones that have wasted my time and money.

Show results",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:25 am",miiila,5,"Business did fluctuate a bit but not so much more than within a similar time period pre COVID, and I was “busy enough”, also, my prices are very fair, figuring in Fiverr’s cut and all (and buyers who know what they are doing, or Google a bit to see what realistic prices and delivery times for quality work might be, should get to the same conclusion) so, no, I haven’t.
I also have many return and regular customers, and while some were affected due to the nature of their business, others weren’t, or even had more to do, that probably evened it out a bit.
My plan in case I’d have had more free time than I’d have liked for more than a month was actually not to lower my prices but to set up some new gigs and do more “offline” and with my own site.
I guess lowering one’s prices might work in a pinch but if they are already fair or even a bit (or much) lower than they should be, it can be problematic to rise them again when it becomes unsustainable.
In addition to that, I have to pay exactly the same for everything myself, partly even more (groceries have become more expensive), so lowering my own prices while my COL stays the same or is even higher, seems a bad idea, unless I’d not get enough orders as it is.
I’ll be flexible if I have to, but for now, I’m happier with cutting down on my non-essential expenses, doing an order ot two less per week, and having more time for other things than work.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:17 am",2020-09-09 20:41:02.205468

Thank you, kind regards.",N/A,N/A,N/A,jonbaas,4,"I can’t comment on the Spanish CEO category, because that isn’t a service category that I am familiar with. However, I can say with certainty that there is a drastically increased level of competition on Fiverr, as a result of the global pandemic. More sellers, means existing sellers tend to see lower metrics from the search results. Perhaps there are too many people trying to sell services for your keywords, and your services aren’t being seen as much.
It’s also worth noting that, people just might not be searching for your services as much. The world is changing – even moreso because of Covid. Perhaps there isn’t as much demand for your services now, compared to in the past.
Perhaps this might be a good time to start marketing and promoting your own services too, instead of relying on only the Fiverr search system to provide all your orders.",N/A,"Jul 14, 2020 10:19 pm",2020-09-09 20:41:54.710745

Is Corona Virus Pandemic really directly or indirectly affecting Orders?
There are many reasons why your sales levels could rise or fall. Let’s not get into the habit of conveniently blaming the Covid pandemic for everything. I’ve been seeing a lot of sellers doing this lately. Perhaps your competitors are doing a better job winning over your potential clients. Maybe there just isn’t as much demand for your services, or perhaps your service offering has grown a bit stale, and needs to be updated. Maybe your gig has entered rotation in the search results, and isn’t being seen by as many people as before. Are you doing any self-marketing? Are you doing anything on your own to connect to your target customers?
If things aren’t going as well as they once were, perhaps there are things that YOU can do to turn things back around. Trying to find something else to blame for the low sales isn’t a productive way to improve your success.",N/A,"Jul 3, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-09-09 20:42:15.035188

I’m pretty sure my allergies are starting to flare up. I’m not really self-isolating but really just staying to myself. Luckily, I can really rest because I have no work to speak of anymore.

I’m not too worried about my personal health because if it is COVID-19, at least now I know that it won’t kill me or make me extremely unwell. It honestly feels like that annoying bronchitis that comes after tonsilitis. Irritating and I feel a little rough, but not any worse than a cold. I do however worry about the people I came into contact with before I started presenting symptoms.

No cough, though.
Many people don’t develop a cough. Some people just have a fever, and some people have just the cough. NHS advises anyone with either OR both to self-isolate. Here’s hoping you’ve already had it and now you’re not at risk anymore!! <3",N/A,"Mar 17, 2020 1:21 pm",2020-09-09 20:42:36.461819

Some hot humid weather might help this in the summer with any luck.
To be fair, I’m more concerned about my country collapsing on itself than the dang virus. There are very questionable political decisions being made that have nothing to do with the virus but will without a doubt provoke a strong public response (i.e., massive protests). I.e., huge public gatherings in the middle of the pandemic. I had a good long ugly cry about it this morning.

My son has it and is self isolating - #2 daughter and I took him a care package of loo roll, washing up liquid, soap and various other bits and pieces, as well as dinner in a vacuum flask thingy tonight. We’ll probably be doing that a lot over the coming fortnight.
Here in Glasgow you cannot get paper goods for love nor money. Soap is in very short supply … but not shampoo for some reason. Shelves and shelves of shampoo and conditioner with no one interested in it. At a pinch, you can use that as shower gel and washing up liquid - it all has the same base, apparently.
Luckily, we’d put some stuff aside for Brexit, which we still have … or at least what’s left of it after Brexit didn’t really happen that much.
And yes, that EFT tapping for increasing lung capacity is a great idea. EFT for anything is a good idea. I have a tapping round for making sure your system is open to accepting everything you do for yourself, which is really useful.
@graphtersawyer - take a breath, make sure you focus on what you can control rather than the things you can’t … and, if necessary, isolate yourself in your own room as much as possible. Thinking of you.
@creativetie - take good care of yourself. Not easy to be alone and sick.

I think that the numbers are so unknown and this has been circulating in the US for so long now. And young people are not taking it seriously. Even though they are less likely to get sick, they can spread it. Until we have a full picture of how bad or not bad it is, we can not make rational decisions. Right now it is preparing for worse case scenarios. We have no real data from tests. We need testing. No real guidance from the Government. State leaders are figuring things out on their own. Where I live they are turning DMV (Department of Motor Vehicle) stations into testing centers. We are about 7 weeks past our first case in the US, and we are just getting testing going. Nuts.
Will everyone get tested if it is free? Non citizens? Will they risk going to the hospital and getting deported? Just my personal thoughts. Frustrating to watch it unfold in slow motion.

I would question that information. Singapore closed their borders completely a long time ago.
They don’t even let in some people who stick outside and residing in Singapore and suddenly they will allow people from Your country to fly here with covid already? Nah, I highly doubt that.
One person from nearby country tried to do that on his private jet to treat COVID in Singapore and after that government made an announcement that they wouldn’t allow that anymore.

The metrics are still being accrued, they just aren’t being displayed. Gigs have not stopped gaining impressions just because the impressions are not being displayed.
Do you really believe the analytics data is stored correctly everywhere in Fiverr’s databases etc. (eg.in all relevant tables) and that it just can’t show those values?
Don’t you think the analytics page just basically took values that were already stored somewhere (like in fields in a particular table or that could easily be calculated from them) and then displayed them (eg. in the graph/as values)?
It’s not really a “display issue” if it’s wrong in one or more places in the database. The analytics page wouldn’t read through lots of data to show one value to the user as it wouldn’t be efficient.
Why would it take multiple weeks to show a value that is already stored correctly when the code for showing that data in the graph hasn’t really changed? Where’s the difficulty in showing a value that is already stored correctly using the method they already had? And if it was correct everywhere in the database, why was it only recent days’ values that started being shown as 0 when the previous days were being shown correctly (before they changed everything to show “N/A”).
It’s obviously stored wrong somewhere (if stored at all in that place) in the database and that was what was getting displayed before they changed it to show “N/A”. And they’re obviously trying to fix the values somewhere in the database (even if it’s right somewhere else) or get it to start writing the values correctly somewhere in the database for a seller’s analytics figures (eg. daily/weekly/monthly totals).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:16.356871

Daily & weekly or monthly impressions? I’m not sure they can - at least without totalling them in the way (or similar to) they’re trying to get the system to do automatically.
And yes the numbers (such as daily/weekly/monthly totals) for things like clicks or conversions might get used by the algorithms(s) used by the search engine. And if some of them are wrong (incorrectly totalled for some, no values or zero values for others), then it could potentially affect the Fiverr search engine results.

I don’t think Fiverr is giving a full enough version of what is actually happening by saying what they have. They’re saying it’s a “display issue” just so it doesn’t seem that big of an issue - but it’s taken weeks to try and fix and the last post in the “N/A” thread says it will still be a few more weeks. Values might be getting stored in one place but not in the place needed by the gigs screen - it’s not stored correctly in the place in the database that that gigs screen reads (eg. the totals - and that could effect other things like the search engine if that also reads those totals).
It’s obviously not just a “display issue”. It must be stored incorrectly somewhere for it to have shown it incorrectly like they did. Like I said, it would be too inefficient for it to be reading lots of records before showing the monthly/weekly/daily totals for each gig (in the “gigs” page) so it’s very unlikely to be doing that (it would have to keep re-reading all those tons of records each time you reloaded the page) - instead it will have been using stored values - and they will have recently (before the “N/A” change) been incorrect (or not set).
Fiverr haven’t said what exactly has caused this or whether those values/totals for clicks/views etc. for gigs are correct in every place in the database(s) or anywhere else they’re stored - or explained why a piece of code that was displaying the values suddenly stopped working (what changed apart from the stored data that was used by that code?).",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:18.295325

They have told us what we need to know. Nothing is stopping any seller from earning sales. And, as is often said on this forum, earning sales is an issue of seller self-responsibility, not waiting around for Fiverr to provide sales. We know what we need to know. Fiverr – or any Fiverr display error – is not keeping anyone from being responsible and earning their success.

So since Fiverr haven’t given us a full enough story about what has happened and whether the data is correct in every place in the database(s) etc. we can’t really continue saying that it’s being stored correctly (at least not everywhere).
If it was being stored correctly everywhere, how long really would it take to display that value on screen?

Yes but Fiverr should really be open enough about the issue, especially if people are going to repeat what they say as though all values are correctly stored everywhere (which, if that was true, it would surely be easy to display it). If Fiverr aren’t going to say what has happened fully enough, we shouldn’t really be saying “everything is being stored correctly (as though they’re all being stored/totalled correctly everywhere they normally are)”.",N/A,"Jun 11, 2020 4:38 pm",2020-09-09 20:44:19.887618

That’s not going to help me to know that. Fiverr doesn’t need to tell us details. It seems like it’s some sort of a big deal to speculate about the intricate details and whether or not it really is a display issue. Why would anyone care?
Would it set your mind at ease if fiverr published a 12 page analysis of all the technical details of what is going on complete with all the technical jargon?
I’m sure you would go on at length about that if they did. Arguing the reason it can’t be correct.

I saw somewhere that Micha Kaufman (sp?) say the overall bottom line has increased on 5r since the C-19.
Apparently, with people working from home, they’re using more and more freelancers to help out. Even though many people in USA were laid off, businesses still need their skills.
Since SB can’t afford full timers, they are turning to part timers, which includes freelancers from all platforms.

Show results",N/A,N/A,N/A,jonbaas,4,"To be honest, this poll request isn’t likely to yield any valuable data. The experiences of each seller are different. I know sellers who are doing just fine during the months of COVID – just as they were before COVID. I know some who are even having fantastic sales levels. I also know some sellers who are seeing a slight drop in sales, but nothing noticeably connected to the global pandemic. And I still see countless new sellers (as I have for years) who have no sales at all because they aren’t doing anything to compete in the marketplace. Sales largely have nothing to do with the coronavirus at all, and everything to do with the seriousness, and the willingness of sellers to be proactive and build their own success – no matter what is happening in the world.
Let’s be mindful that we don’t fall into the trap of always trying to find something else to blame for our lack of success. If your sales aren’t at the level you want them to be, then change your tactics, experiment, find new ways to connect with your target customers.

How would knowing whether other sellers have seen their sales go up, or down over the past few months, help any seller become a better seller here on Fiverr? Everyone’s experience is different. A poll like this is just a random feel-good content-filler. This has been asked many times before, and every time before, it has resulted in information that does not help any seller become a better seller.
It shouldn’t matter how well other sellers are doing. What matters is how each seller chooses to focus on their own goals, and build their own sales success. We are all independent sellers here.

It doesn’t – in any way – mean that sales have decreased for sellers all across the board. Point of fact, my own sales have not decreased, at all, due to COVID (I know other sellers who can say the same), so, again, this poll is just a poll. It’s just a fun forum poll. It is nothing more than the random opinion of 14 people on the Fiverr forum.
This is why forum polls are generally pointless when it comes to categorizing Fiverr as a whole. 14 people do not, in any way, represent the success of Fiverr’s sellers on this site.",N/A,"Jun 7, 2020 7:21 pm",2020-09-09 20:45:13.113804

Each one of my gigs went from top-3 best-selling to the bottom of the last page overnight and I gotta be honest… It sucks! I really hope that they fix this as investing 150% of your energy to build a good profile with a solid portfolio and make a brand out there to just get it all flushed down the toilet overnight just sucks. And I was just starting to get a really good amount of orders because I had the reviews, I made my gigs look the way I wanted them to look, I was getting decent impressions and my prices were fair and solid. I even took some steps in expanding my business because it was starting to get hard managing all the orders so I bought a drawing monitor for my cousin and I started teaching him what I do so that he can help me but I guess it won’t happen. If your theory is right I hope that they fire the dude who suggested this idea. A lot of sellers who were working hard and building their profiles providing amazing services are not getting any orders now since the beginning of May and their gigs are nowhere to be seen and some of them commented in the Forum that they will start to look for alternatives because having zero control over your gig ranking is discouraging. Imagine doing everything perfect - Solid amount of sells, competitive prices, unique service, professional looking gig with a perfect rating and then losing everything overnight without a real reason with 0 certainty if you’re going to ever get your ranking back after all of the hard work to make everything perfect to stay on the spot that you just lost.

Fiverr is a business. I can assure you, they are undoubtedly taking their business model VERY seriously. It would be bad business if they weren’t. And, since the search system isn’t broken, they’re doing well upholding their chosen business model.
hamza1424:

You do remember that the world is experiencing a pandemic, and millions of workers have lost their jobs, right? Perhaps Fiverr does not have the option of hiring new workers right now – especially when existing/remaining workers are staying home, and not able to work at the office like they once did.

By the way, I just say “please don’t forget to review” you shouldn’t say “give me 5 start review” that will definitely put you on radar.

Oftentime we observe that whenever there a pandemic took place in the world all the people are compelled to suffer through the pain of loosing their loved ones, loosing employment and going through monetary disadvantages. Which ulitimately throws a blow to their psychological stability. Resulting in the familial chaos and even random behavioural changes in some persons. Which is often termed as insanity.
Causes Behind Outspread :
Majority of the world population do not directly contribute to the formation of a chaotic situation like the current CODIV-19 pandemic, but a very few people can be called to be the ultimate responsibles behind it. Exploitation of the natual aroma or the coverage by practicing unimaginable food diet is one of the causes behind it. This is not very new the world has faced but there were famines which destroyed the civilised fabric of the world for several times. Yes, causes behind those things were still can be attributed to few people again because to carry on preventive measures all the governments were required to be prance but the absense of which opened the door for these evilsome disasters to come forth. Though the role of natural calamity can not be ignored at all.
But the entire blame can not be attributed to the handful of people because even after the outbreak of COVID-19 and instead of being fully aware of its preventive measures people are coming outsite, having fight with the implementors of the regulations and ultimately widening the evenue for the virus to come in.
So we can say that it is lack of “morality” and the “sense of Protection” that is generating the havoc. This kind of situations will again take place as the evidances from the future but amalgamation of awereness and proactive thinking with maorality will help us to reduce its intensity in future.
Roles Of Online Market Places In Situations Of Financial Crisis :
In our age-old days people faced the same situations again and again. They faced the same financial crisis with more severe outcomes.But in current era the situation have completed a full circle with the advent of Information Technology(IT) and its widespread to each and every corner of the world. As blessing of which new marketplaces like “fiverr” have come to us like the blessings from heaven. Earlier people have less employment opportunity. They either had to rely on their employers for their payments and the services but fiverr have changed the entire scenario by providing opportunity to all the sellers to choose their own services and also to generate a handsome revenue online sitting at home. In the current phase it is not possible to go outside for the search of an offline employment due to ongoing worldwide lockdown. But it does not prevent us from generating revenue as we have fiverr with us.Realising “the hero inside me”, as per the quote, has been made possible by this marketplace. It did not make us to realise that we are really in the lockdown state.
And when it comes to counter the “Psychological Instability” I would say, it provides us with plenty of work that there is no time to let our psyche turn instable. And the monetary needs are also getting supplemented.
Overall I,being a member of this fiverr communinty,am feeling honoured to get the opportunity to get into the regime, thanks to the team. Due to your effort many of the families are now supplementing their needs and many have turned itno well-off and famous beings just after working with you thus a greatest salute to you.

As blessing of which new marketplaces like “fiverr” have come to us like the blessings from heaven. Earlier people have less employment opportunity. They either had to rely on their employers for their payments and the services but fiverr have changed the entire scenario by providing opportunity to all the sellers to choose their own services and also to generate a handsome revenue online sitting at home. In the current phase it is not possible to go outside for the search of an offline employment due to ongoing worldwide lockdown. But it does not prevent us from generating revenue as we have fiverr with us.Realising “the hero inside me”, as per the quote, has been made possible by this marketplace. It did not make us to realise that we are really in the lockdown state.
And when it comes to counter the “Psychological Instability” I would say, it provides us with plenty of work that there is no time to let our psyche turn instable. And the monetary needs are also getting supplemented.
Overall I,being a member of this fiverr communinty,am feeling honoured to get the opportunity to get into the regime, thanks to the team. Due to your effort many of the families are now supplementing their needs and many have turned itno well-off and famous beings just after working with you thus a greatest salute to you.
THANK YOU SO MUCH fiverr AND TEAM

Oftentime we observe that whenever there a pandemic took place in the world all the people are compelled to suffer through the pain of loosing their loved ones, loosing employment and going through monetary disadvantages. Which ulitimately throws a blow to their psychological stability. Resulting in the familial chaos and even random behavioural changes in some persons. Which is often termed as insanity.
Causes Behind Outspread :
Majority of the world population do not directly contribute to the formation of a chaotic situation like the current CODIV-19 pandemic, but a very few people can be called to be the ultimate responsibles behind it. Exploitation of the natual aroma or the coverage by practicing unimaginable food diet is one of the causes behind it. This is not very new the world has faced but there were famines which destroyed the civilised fabric of the world for several times. Yes, causes behind those things were still can be attributed to few people again because to carry on preventive measures all the governments were required to be prance but the absense of which opened the door for these evilsome disasters to come forth. Though the role of natural calamity can not be ignored at all.
But the entire blame can not be attributed to the handful of people because even after the outbreak of COVID-19 and instead of being fully aware of its preventive measures people are coming outsite, having fight with the implementors of the regulations and ultimately widening the evenue for the virus to come in.
So we can say that it is lack of “morality” and the “sense of Protection” that is generating the havoc. This kind of situations will again take place as the evidances from the future but amalgamation of awereness and proactive thinking with maorality will help us to reduce its intensity in future.
Roles Of Online Market Places In Situations Of Financial Crisis :

They faced the same financial crisis with more severe outcomes.But in current era the situation have completed a full circle with the advent of Information Technology(IT) and its widespread to each and every corner of the world.
