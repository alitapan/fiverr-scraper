Wow where did you find this?
According to an article on Businesswire:
Fiverr is releasing platform-specific gender pay gap information based on a significant sample of data, showing that women on its platform are out-earning men in more ways than one. Specific statistics include:
Globally, women are making more than men on Fiverr. The average earnings for women are 19% higher than the average earnings for men. They are also earning roughly 3% more on a per-project basis than men.
Female freelancers are also receiving more work than men, leading to these higher earnings. In December of 2019, they benefited from 5% more projects from customers than men. And in June of the same year, they received 10% more projects from customers than men.

Thank you,
Blaise",N/A,1,"Aug 29, 2017 9:46 pm",blaisefaint,9,"Here’s a quick and dirty field report.
I had no idea what to expect, but I screwed up my courage and drove 20-some miles to the big city of Greensboro and parked downtown.
Being from a small town where just about every restaurant has ample parking, I was shocked, SHOCKED to find I had to hunt for a spot on the street. Because the venue was a few blocks away, I could have parked in the parking deck beside the main branch of the Greensboro Public Library and gotten my parking validated for the first 2 hours, but if I had gone that route I would have been late.
Given that there was only one free parking space and the car in the space behind me parked over their line, I have to say I did one of the finest parallel parking jobs evah.
If I had taken a picture of my parking job to post here, I’m sure there would be a huge clamor for me to create a gig of myself parallel parking, but I’m just not sure I want to commit to that sort of gig, so I didn’t.
When I entered the venue, I told the greeter team that I was here for the Fiverr event, and some dude whose name I don’t remember told me I was on the second floor.
I looked around carefully, because I had walked in off the sidewalk, and I corrected the dude: “No, I’m definitely on the first floor!”
I then walked up the steps and joined the Fiverr group on the second floor, from which point until I left, I was on the second floor, but just for the sake of accuracy in the historical record, at the time that dude told me I was on the second floor, I was in fact on the first floor.
For the record.
This was the first Fiverr event for this area, so the turnout was light, at about 7 people.
Hopefully, in the future, more Fiverrians in the Greensboro area will attend, as the word gets out that these events are taking place.
My general input for people who are organizing these types of events in the future:
definitely there should be more details in advance of the event, so people have an idea of what to expect, like:
If I go, will I be met with only tumbleweeds? Or will the event be so jam-packed that I’d be wise to wear adult Depends?
Open bar?
Cash bar?
Free appetizers?
Pot luck?
Door prizes?
If I register to attend, will I get a name badge when I check in? Do I check in? Is there a password or a secret sign, like, “Hey, I’m here for the Fiverr event” or flashing five fingers on my left hand? My right hand? Two fingers on the left and three on the right? Should I wear my own name tag? If I wear my own name tag, will that make me look lame? When I registered for the event, I was emailed a ticket. I made sure I could access the ticket on my phone if needed, but it would have been a waste for me to print out the ticket, because at no point did anyone ask to see my ticket, so it would have been nice to know I didn’t need a ticket…
If I show up at 6:30, will they say, “Aww! The cool kids don’t show up till 8:30!”?
If I stay till 8:30 will they say, “Aww! The cool kids left 2 hours ago!”?
Will this event lead to the formation of a local Fiverr Mastermind group where we get our synergy on and have workshops to help us all supercharge our Fiverr sales?
If I wear the wrong color blouse will I be accosted by roving bands of young ruffians flashing gang signs and waving semi-automatic weapons around?
Will I be invited to sit at the cool kids table, or will the cool kids freeze me out?
Given that some Fiverr freelancers are as young as 13, is the venue chosen bearing that in mind?

I have traveled more and taken more breaks away in the past 3-4 years than in the previous 20.
Short, rejuvenating breaks to a hotel, hostel, campsite, etc at a time when prices are cheapest because other people are stuck in the work week cycle means I can get rock bottom prices on a Tuesday in October for example.
All the while, I can keep up on my work with a few hours in the morning and just experience life from a different place.

Being able to schedule my work around my life and what I want to do and especially around my family is so valuable! For example my teenage son has an exhibition of his work at school today in the middle of the day. His Dad had to ask his boss in advance to change his shift today and will possibly miss the last 15 minutes of the presentation, whereas I just shifted my work around to fit in to my life and I’m going to enjoy the full presentation, then taking the rest of the day off with both my kids to celebrate.

I agree with your comment on target audience. My twitter account feed has writers of all genre, including poetry, fiction and non fiction.
If I were to “share” some of the work I’ve gotten done on 5r, it would be ebook covers, blurbs, books and illustrations. Anything I get outside writing, artwork or books would be waste of time.
Perhaps, one of these days, I’ll link one of my sellers 5r account to an artwork he/she did on my feed. To see if it helps them get sales - of course, I’d get the sellers okay First.",N/A,"Apr 24, 2017 6:42 pm",2020-08-12 23:32:57.907914

Regular",7,"I’ve advertised on varied social media sites and a personal landing page that directs back to Fiverr. My results have been stronger offering specials and Fiverr Anywhere unique offers on my personal page. Overall, though, I find social media to be relatively poor as a place to advertise until I establish an actual meaningful presence and gain followers/friends/forum contacts who are the right audience for my own gigs.
I think that the building of relationships on social media sites and forums is underutilized by many sellers due to the time it takes, but it’s the best way to find truly interested potential buyers.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2017 2:42 am",2020-08-12 23:32:59.889208

Do you promote your Fiverr Gigs on social media and if so, what platform do you prefer/get the most hits from?
There’s no option for sellers who don’t promote their gig in social media yet part of the question is Do you promote your Fiverr Gigs on social media
I guess my answer is Other - I don’t do any promotion on social media.
My Facebook friends know what I do so I don’t care to spam them
I don’t have lot of Twitter followers, simply don’t have time to Tweet enough to collect them
I do some promotion through my website, but then I don’t wish to send clients to Fiverr. I sell my service through my site and don’t have to share my income with Fiverr
misscrystal:
If you manage to have someone come to fiverr from a social media site, how do you make sure they buy your gig instead of someone else’s?
I hope in the future it would be possible to track how buyers reach your profile. I’m sure Fiverr has this data, so hopefully they will share it.",N/A,"Apr 25, 2017 5:40 am",2020-08-12 23:33:00.706692

misscrystal:
If you manage to have someone come to fiverr from a social media site, how do you make sure they buy your gig instead of someone else’s?
Probably the answer would be, you don’t. I think the idea is that if enough Sellers are using social media to bring in Buyers, the marketplace sales as a whole will improve.",N/A,"Apr 26, 2017 3:20 am",2020-08-12 23:33:05.831064

I think that the building of relationships on social media sites and forums is underutilized by many sellers due to the time it takes, but it’s the best way to find truly interested potential buyers.
Only feels time consuming when its forced. Most regulars here could generate allot of sales just by doing what they do here on the forums, no ads or clever sales speeches needed (nobody likes those anyway). Just make sure your business is well presented in your profiles, then find topics and discussions that interest you and contribute, no need to mention gigs or business unless asked.",N/A,"Apr 26, 2017 6:19 pm",2020-08-12 23:33:07.404313

When are they coming to Asia
“They” are not. But YOU can!
This is community related. We are buyers and sellers who want to make the most of our experience. Start a group in your area.
Our group keeps getting stronger, and last month we had a great time. After it officially ended at 9 pm, people talked for over 45 minutes before we “kicked them out” and then a few hung around in the parking lot for another 30 minutes discussing different issues.
In other words, people could have easily left, but they were finding value in talking with other sellers and buyers, so they stayed.
I expect that to continue, looking forward to seeing those who make it in July and beyond.",N/A,"Jul 8, 2017 3:42 pm",2020-08-12 23:33:29.654483

Head aches are gone and I sleep much better.",N/A,"May 4, 2017 7:38 am",2020-08-12 23:34:33.719104

I thought it looked familiar…
You have a great inspirational space, with the lighting this way. Johannes Vermeer used a space that was very similar so often in his paintings. He changed it to suit, the shape of the window panes to manipulate the light and draw the eye or let it go elsewhere, and even coloring them for balance, or changing the arrangement of the furniture and the cabinets - or lack thereof, with tapestry hangings or painting in other artist’s paintings on the wall in the back for added theme and allegory. He used your arrangement in many of his paintings, with a table or workspace placed just where yours is. The lighting and the space are wonderful, aren’t they? I do like your arrangement, so clean and flowing. A lucky guy with an artistic eye!",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/e/d/ed78396084c3380ab9f8b16cae8da660d08ae60a.jpg,"May 6, 2017 6:45 am",2020-08-12 23:34:34.904092

A transcript of this episode is available here 108.",N/A,1,"Dec 28, 2016 1:57 pm",jshrade,8,"Another excellent podcast by our Top Sellers. I look forward to these every week!
Being in the website design side of Fiverr I’ve definitely run into my fair share of scenarios that resulted in a “no”. This category is one of the more expensive categories, so I have had to learn to handle clients that are wanted an extremely discounted service. Now, where I differ from the Top Sellers a bit is that I do provide discounts from time to time, but this all depends on what the client needs. I have a basic pricing structure, but if the client pushes back on the price and the work that’s involved with their website isn’t too great then I will certainly consider a discount.
That being said, I do have a limit to the amount of discount I will apply for a set amount of work. If the buyer wants me to dip below that, I ensure them that the quality of work they are getting from me is top-notch and they’re going to get the best customer service with me. I also provide a money-back guarantee, so if things don’t work out or we aren’t a good fit for reach other we can mutually cancel the order. If it ever comes to that, I always provide some resources for other Fiverr sellers that may be able to fit their need.
As Adam said, don’t cheapen your service (or Fiverr for that matter) just to get a sale. Yes, there are other Fiverr sellers who offer the same service for less, but just let the buyer know that the work you provide and communication exceeds the level of service your competition is going to come to the table with. You’ll be amazed at how many of those “nos” you can turn into sales and ongoing clients.

In my personal experience the buyers that turn out to ask me to go out of my way and do unrealistic tasks are the ones that I’ve sent offers to through this medium.
Personally, I never hesitate to send good offers and try to reason with buyers, presenting to them why my service is worth their money and what I’m willing to offer for what they’re willing to pay. Its basically like saying “No, I can’t provide you with this service but, I can give you this instead and assure you that you won’t regret it.”
What my little experience here has taught me is that you lose nothing by saying “no” because some gigs are not worth the $4 you’ll earn from them.",N/A,"Sep 10, 2015 1:56 am",2020-08-12 23:35:38.935273

Perhaps I read the new modification feature rules incorrectly. It appears that Fverr does allow you to offer 0 free modifications, but then you have to offer at the option for at least one paid modification. Buyers have to have the option to pursue some sort of modification if they wish free, or paid.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is how the explanation was worded – by Fiverr – when the feature was released and explained.
Noted by @adi_so (Fiverr employee) in her July 2 forum post explaining how the feature works:
“Choosing zero modifications
This will set up a default of 1 paid modification at $5. This is because your Gig must offer your customers the option for modifications. So if your Gig includes no free modifications, then there should be at least one paid modification available.”

Any kind of creative seller builds a library of tools and from experience of looking at Fiverr, 99% of animated video makers are already selling near identical products due to them using the same paid for and stolen tools.
If Fiverr made free libraries of tools available to sellers, you’re basically giving sellers with no creative talent a way to undercut people like me who spend $1,000 - $2,000 per year creating our own libraries and end creative products.
I was the first seller on Fiverr to sell real estate videos. Now I make the lowest amount of sales out of hundreds of people selling stolen videohive templates, all of which look near identical and can be profited from even when sold for $5.
Say paid library. Say, congratulations! You’ve just made $5K in sales as a creative seller and we’re going to help you out by giving you access to our premium tool library! For God sake, though, don’t start compounding the fact that Fiverr is already identical animated logo, video, and vector logo central, by making it even easier for the how do I mek sell zombies.",N/A,"Dec 26, 2017 11:20 am",2020-08-12 23:35:52.875000

Most professionals would already have sources for this type of thing and would likely stay away from the free options being used by every unskilled seller who is not prepared to invest in higher quality tools for their business.
If the goal is to provide something useful to help new sellers, a better focus would be to sort out the Buyer Request section and make that usable - right now it is horrendous for both buyers and sellers despite that format being the crux of most other freelance sites!",N/A,"Dec 26, 2017 11:57 am",2020-08-12 23:35:53.533927

What is more, in terms of sales across the board, it would look good for a while on paper for Fiverr. The only thing is, this would be the last nail in the creative coffin for people like me surrounded by people who already make a business out of illegally selling video and effects stolen from elsewhere.
One minute Fiverr wants everyone to working to what it considers a higher standard. The next it also wants to give sellers who would and should fail through lack of initiative, extra leverage to make a few bucks.
Also, regarding the recent survey. It was a bit sneaky asking what tools I use. Can’t we just have a year of non-interference for 2018.

OK things on my wishlist
Lower commission on high value orders
It is clear fiverr is working towards higher value orders, which is awesome. I totally understand the 20% on small orders and in general terms, but when quoting on higher value orders, the commission is just too high. I think it would be great to have a staggered commission rate on orders over a certain price point, as otherwise it reduces the value for the customer.
Perhaps:
$5-$250 20%
$250-$500 17.5%
$500-$750 15%
$750-$1000 12.5%
over $1000 10%
or something like that?
Fully transparent pricing for customers
Again something that reduces the value for customers is the processing fee. I don’t think this makes a huge impact on a $5 order, but again for bigger orders, it can make a difference. Importantly, it is not included on any custom offer quotes, which is really unfair to customers, as they think they will be paying a certain price, but then find out ONLY once paying for the order, that it is actually more. I think there should be a way to show the breakdown/fees as part of that order process more clearly. Also enable that processing fee to be shown on quotes, so no nasty surprises for clients later.
Make it clearer the site is in USD
I often get new customers being miffed to find my quote is actually in USD. Experienced sellers understand the site is in USD, but for any country with a currency that is a dollar currency, they could easily think the price is being quoted in their own currency - for example Australian dollars, not USD dollars. I would like that to be clearer - again for the benefit of buyers.
Withdrawing a partial balance
Currently we can only withdraw the entire of our balance, but I would LOVE to be able to choose how much to withdraw, to ideally leave a small amount in fiverr in case I wanted to purchase gigs.
Dashboard improvements
I love the dashboard and use it constantly, but the current layout could include a lot more information easily. Currently each item just says “you need to deliver your order” and the customers name. With a “deliver now” box. It would be really great to at least have the details of what gig that was and instead of “deliver now” a see more info box or something like that, as deliver now doesn’t actually deliver now, it just takes you to the order. You then have to click another box to deliver. I know we have the manage sales area, with more info, but I like having everything on the dashboard together as a summary.
I would also love to be able to manually set the order items appear on the dashboard. Sometimes it seems to get all mixed up and not put the items in the correct order of when they are due. Sometimes the review response messages are at the top etc etc. It would be great to be able to have some control over how we see this.
Bringing order/Inbox notes together
I totally understand why the order and inbox messages are separate, but it would be awesome for there to be a way to easily transfer inbox messages to an order, as some clients message outside the order and it can be really hard to keep on top of things with info in two places. Even if there was a little link to say transfer this message to order xxx. Or else a way to cut and paste the messages across, without making that message notify the customer - ie tick a box to say do not notify customer of this message. That would also be handy for leaving notes for yourself about the order.
Restricted account access for VA’s etc
I would really love it if there was a way to give someone else access to your account, but in a restricted way, ie just for messages and order information. For the situation of getting someone to help with order messages etc, without them having full access to financials, etc
Agreed time extension
I would love if there was a way for a client to extend time, if the issue is on their end. Ie they order before they have all their information ready, or send a script etc, but the order clock is still ticking down. This isn’t fair and puts stress on when it really shouldn’t. It would also be appropriate for when the customer changes something, and you agree to do it, but again, it will take extra time. There are many circumstances where this would be helpful and obviously it would have restrictions.
Time extension when customers request a modification
This is probably an extension of the above comment - but I am referring to AFTER the order has been delivered now. Sometimes customers request modifications that are outside of the spec of the original order, which can sometimes mean extra time to deliver. The client agrees, but there are big red stressful LATE signs all over the gig. It would be very helpful if when a buyer requests a modification, the seller is then able to assign that a delivery time, rather than it being marked late. Ideally, when we set the number of modifications, we can set the time it takes for those modifications - ie 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours etc.
Modification confirmation for buyers
Many many times buyers press the modification request, not for a modification, but to ask a question etc etc. I think it would be great when they press modification, to have a pop up box saying “are you unhappy with your order?” click here (take them to the modifications) or “do you have a question or message for your seller?” click here (direct to messages). Or something like that. It would also be good if the buyer gets a gig with no modifications included, that they get a message saying “this gig does not include any free modifications, would you like to contact your seller?” and send them to messages.
Quick responses
I LOVE the quick responses, one of my favourite new features, but I would love them even more if they were able to be organised. Either by folders (so you can separate inbox/customer service responses from delivery responses) or even just being able to change the order around, so the most frequently used ones are at the top.
Order instructions
I also LOVE the new instructions page for the buyers, but I would love it more if it was clearer on the order instructions, which part was my message to them and which part was their response. Sometimes (and on the mobile app) it bolds my message to them and does a dashed lined between. Please make that happen all the time
Being able to see your gig as a buyer
I would love to be able to see what my gig looks like to buyers, the whole way from start to finish, so I can quickly and easily see if I have set it up in the best way - ie including the instructions page. There is no way to do that at the moment unless you order your own gig - which you can’t. There are things on my gig I had no idea would (or wouldn’t) show up, until I had actually ordered other gigs from other sellers. Many sellers don’t buy gigs, so I think a feature like that could improve the quality of gigs generally.
Featured gigs
I have been here for almost 12 months and in that time, I have noticed that almost all of the gigs marked “featured” are the same as they were 12 months ago, it doesn’t look like any/many gigs have been added to that featured line up? It would be cool for these to change up a bit more.
Customer service
Please please PLEASE increase the customer service resources and encourage the agents to actually read the requests instead of flicking cookie cutter responses that don’t actually respond to the issue. Enough said
Last but not least…
A personal problem point - please take the word voicemail off the banned word list!!! I had HUGE problems setting up a voicemail gig and as I am a voiceover artist, who records voicemails on a daily basis, I am continually frustrated with having to change it to voice mail just to get it past the banned word list (and have to do the same thing on my gig). Perhaps if you do a gig that does voicemail, you could be excepted to certain words (same thing for other categories?)
Well done if you managed to get to the end of my long long wishlist!

-I would love to see a change in the current rating system such as visible buyer ratings. Also, why does a buyer get the opportunity to change his/her rating within 3 days, this should only be possible with consent.
-Something I would love to see is, if a profile is set for vacation mode, wouldn’t it be absolutely wonderful for the profile to be still visible in the search(with the current notification model in place) , so potential client would have the opportunity to wait for that particular seller?
-Who doesn’t want a BLOCK buyer button
-The possibility for partial refunds, for example if a client overpaid by mistake.
-No commission on tips (though I understand this would be a almost impossible from an administrative perspective)
Thank you Fiverr for the wonderful opportunities you create for all the sellers and buyers.
It has been an absolute fantastic year. I also want to say thank you to all the Fiver staff for all their hard work and for making Fiverr better and better.

1.I really would love the response rate to be removed.
2. For sellers to see beforehand if a buyer will be a spammer or not good for business. I know there might not be any control for buyers with stolen credit card, but it would be nice to see if for example a buyer was rated maybe three different times or more negatively. I think this will be in the best interest for the sellers because you wouldn’t be wasting time with such a buyer in the first place.
3. Improve the report button when you do not want a buyer or even seller to contact you because even when you click on report these messages are still filtering too.
4. Oh raise my base gig category soon from $5 lol I had to put that in for the new year.
5. Make my gigs page more user friendly for me to understand, this might seem a personal one for someone who is a novice in understanding the graphs, but maybe a report on what was happening in the month or every quarterly will not be a bad idea.
6. Allow sellers to get a breakdown of monthly reports of sales, from what I am getting yes I know it’s my responsibility to keep track of this and download what’s happening for sales, but currently the csv only shows the order number and the amount, maybe this is too much to ask, but a more detailed report of having this instead of only order number, amount and date the current one is just bland.
Thank you.
Ps. Great improvements on some areas of the site so looking forward to what will be happening in the near future.",N/A,"Dec 14, 2015 12:09 pm",2020-08-12 23:36:24.957478

I appreciate the work fiverr has been putting into the site. Really, you guys are awesome! Just a thought. I’m a level 2 seller here, and I’m hearing in the podcast about features that I have never used. I think there are a lot of things fiverr has to offer, but it takes quiet a while to figure out this site and features. There aren’t a lot of links near buttons or features to help explain things, and get us to the right information, so we have to wade through a lot of stuff just to get our answers or to understand features. I think if the site was more friendly for both the buyer and seller, where information was just a click away and not lost in some tab somewhere that no one finds, then we would appreciate fiverr more.",N/A,"Dec 15, 2015 8:13 am",2020-08-12 23:36:26.539613

One thing that Americans can do for taxes is start an S-Corporation, corporations are able to deduct certain taxes that individuals might not be able to deduct. For example, a corporation can deduct rent, internet bill, gasoline, mileage, food, cable or Amazon Prime bill (you need it for inspiration), etc. A good accountant can help you out.
Another thing is you’ll need to pay social security taxes, if you want to collect that benefit someday. A lot of freelancers forget to do that, and it can hurt them later on.
Just remember that before you do Fiverr full-time, make sure you’re making enough money to pay everything and then have some left over. Move to a cheaper city or State to save on rent if necessary.",N/A,"Dec 17, 2015 9:56 pm",2020-08-12 23:36:43.961504

Fiverr Ambassador",0,"Glad you enjoyed the episode!
That’s great advice. As a self employed person in the UK, we can actually deduct certain taxes from working from home (although there are a few rules).
To make the UK calculation, you first define the room you work in and what percentage of time that room is used for working. If a room is used 100% for work you need to pay business rates so the smart option is to split the room purpose. For example, I have an office/entertainment room which consists of my office but also a couch & television.
I factor that I use the room 80% for work and 20% for leisure. Once you have that calculated, you then work out the overall area of the room for your house - this can either be ‘advanced’ in the sense that you work out the square footage of each room or alternatively it can be more simple by just counting the rooms as single entities. I personally just count the rooms.
My house has has 6 rooms. Under UK law I can claim back any house expense which factors into my business (except for telephone or internet unless they are solely for the purpose of the business). So, as an example most home based businesses can claim electric & private rent (not a mortgage).
To find the expense figure (in the UK) you just run the original expense through the formula of:
a = (100 / no of rooms)
b = business use percentage / 100
c = (expense / a) * b
a works out the room ratio/percentage based on amount of rooms in the property
b works out the percentage in decimals for the room use
c works out what you can claim back.
So, say I have 6 rooms, 1 is used for 80% business and I have a £1000 rent, the formula is:
100 / 6 = 16.66666% (round to 16%)
80 / 100 = 0.8
(£1000 / 16) * 0.8 = £133
So, of that £1000 rent bill I can claim back £133 per month. That may not seem like a lot in that scenario but it soon adds up (especially when you consider you will have to pay rent regardless if you worked from home or not). So over the course of a year you would be able to claim back just over £1,500 in expenses for your rent.
I’ve found, when working from home and especially when online, calculating expenses and claiming them back is HUGELY important. This is because it’s so easy with marketplaces like Fiverr to think “Well, all I do is log on and deliver work which only takes my time and skill - I don’t need to pay to offer my services so I have no expenses”. In that scenario, you can often be stung because an at-home business has few expenses which are the same as a storefront and many people fall into the thinking that they don’t have many expenses. So, when tax time comes, they pay an inflated amount compared to if they did indeed have a store front.",N/A,"Dec 22, 2015 10:11 am",2020-08-12 23:36:48.556165

We need you, our Fiverr community, to help us come up with a new logo for Fiverrcast. The assignment is simple: come up with a take on the original Fiverr logo, which looks like this:







All you have to do is add an icon that can be used to represent Fiverrcast. And you don’t have to be a designer to submit—you can just write out your idea and send it over.



See, like we did here for music week:







If your design or idea is picked, you’ll get a $50 Amazon gift card and a bunch of Fiverr swag, including a t-shirt with your logo idea on it. The winning logo will be announced here on the forum at a Live Video Q&A chat with our hosts on September 10th.

We need you, our Fiverr community, to help us come up with a new logo for Fiverrcast. The assignment is simple: come up with a take on the original Fiverr logo, which looks like this:







All you have to do is add an icon that can be used to represent Fiverrcast. And you don’t have to be a designer to submit—you can just write out your idea and send it over.



See, like we did here for music week:







If your design or idea is picked, you’ll get a $50 Amazon gift card and a bunch of Fiverr swag, including a t-shirt with your logo idea on it. The winning logo will be announced here on the forum at a Live Video Q&A chat with our hosts on September 10th.

#Fiverrcast #contest",N/A,N/A,N/A,tracy357,0,"Reply to @edgardo38: Hi, I really like how you’ve done the record and headphones. I can totally see this with different colors too. My only suggestion would be to minimize the thin lines. I just finished logo design class and that is one of their warnings. You want your design to not only be distinguishable and pleasing on a billboard but also to be identifiable on the side of a pen or pencil. Sometimes when you scale it down that small, those lines might muddle up the design. If you can eliminate any of them without changing the design, you should do that. But really great job.",N/A,"Aug 29, 2015 8:41 am",2020-08-12 23:37:34.005397

Perhaps @customdrumloops or @twistedweb123 will respond to this thread, now that I’ve mentioned them both.
I cite the Working Through Language Episode quite a lot, so it would be great if someone with the appropriate permissions were to start a thread for that particular episode, so I could link to it when talking about it in the Forum.
Maybe it’s there and I missed it.

Those with more obligations and responsibilities may have some other instruction or advice. Would make for a great discussion and airing IMO.

Upselling is key and also using your extras to upsell your other gigs/services. I integrate many of my gigs into others through extras as many people who see one gig of mine, might not see the other and using the extras to upsell to those as well works like a charm.

Fiverr Ambassador",0,"Reply to @daaconsulting: Hi daaconsulting,
I’m sorry you’ve had a poor experience (I’m guessing you’re referring to a buying experience?). When looking to place an order from someone you have not worked with before, it’s important to read any previous ratings, view the seller’s other gigs (to get an overall sense of their services) and gauge the information by viewing other competing sellers - this is true of any marketplace and often buying online in general.
To help make your decision a more informed one, Fiverr offer multiple features and information, including but not limited to:
Visible ratings both good and bad
The signup date of the seller
User levels (the higher the level, from 1 to TRS, the more proven the seller)
Portfolio examples of previous work (audio, video, images etc)
If you place an order and you are not happy with the deliverable, there are a few things you can do, such as:
Reach out to the seller and see what changes can be made. The seller may even offer a refund (if they completed the work as outlined, they are not required to but some sellers will to ensure customer satisfaction).
If the seller didn’t create the work as outlined (so the issue isn’t based on personal taste), Fiverr customer support can be contacted and you are likely to receive a refund.
If there’s anything I can personally help with, please feel free to reach out to me.
Regards,
Adam",N/A,"Sep 22, 2015 9:14 am",2020-08-12 23:38:52.165048

Put your questions down in the comments!",N/A,1,"Feb 6, 2017 10:24 am",blaisefaint,1,"Dear M:
It would be helpful to address the issue of just what links who can add where. Or, in the form of a question:
Who can add what links where?
For example, I’ve created over 2500 animations of bvh files on a YouTube playlist dedicated to the CMU Mocap Library. If I could link to this, I could offer Buyers their choice of these animations, with bespoke MakeHuman characters in short animated videos. I mean Buyers could choose from a range of genders, heights, ethnicities, and some basic clothing and hairstyles (as opposed to the Minions videos which are so popular on Fiverr).
I personally think this is cool, but when I’ve tried to link to my YouTube channel in the past, I’ve been smacked down by Fiverr.
I was made to promise to never post a link to my YouTube channel on my profile page, only to be told hours later to disregard that message. I haven’t reposted the link, because I don’t trust that I won’t get flagged again for the same thing, and I did make a promise.
I’ve similarly created “JobInterviewQs”, customizable mock interview questions for your desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This is another sample from my YouTube channel I’m not able to share with potential Buyers because of the paranoia situation on Fiverr. In my humble opinion, it’s a really cool idea with a lot of potential applications, that I’m just not able to monetize on Fiverr because I can’t show Buyers what I’m talking about.
I get that Fiverr doesn’t want people to communicate outside the platform, but it seems perverse to me that you want to pretend that Google doesn’t exist.
Why are Sellers encouraged to post links to their portfolios, only to be penalized for posting links to their portfolios?
Why are Sellers given lists of permissible URLs for their profiles, only to be penalized for posting these URLs to their profiles?
Why is it that apparently some Level 2 Sellers and above get these links approved by the Fiverr editors, but the rest of us can’t?
One of the strategies I like to use to get shh done is to apply logic and common sense to my marketing and branding strategies. Does Fiverr have plans to allow Sellers to use techniques like this, or will we be forever subject to Kafka-esque arbitrary decisions that constantly pull the rug out from under our feet, like my gig that had previously been approved being deleted while I was in the middle of negotiating a $95 dollar deal with a Buyer?
Stuff like that…
Thank you,
Blaise",N/A,"Jan 31, 2017 10:53 pm",2020-08-12 23:39:28.731133

How can we offer customers the chance to order while we are in “Vacation Mode”?
Often times I’m in “Vacation Mode” due to overbooking, but my regular customers keep contacting me with jobs. They know me and don’t care if they have to wait some extra time to work with me.
I used to be able to do this by sending my customers Custom Offers, that they could accept at any time. Now, that option is gone. This was extremely useful to me, since I could schedule a lot of work in advance, and work non-stop, getting rid of downtimes and hence generating a lot of extra revenue for me, and therefore, for Fiverr.
Now, working with my regulars when I’m overbooked is a hassle - the only moment when they can accept my offers is when I’ve got idle time, and am forced to accept orders from anyone. That means that some random guy may get the upper hand and get an order in, when my regular may have actually told me he wanted to place an order days before, and I could do nothing about it.

Customer: Here, take my money whenever you feel like!!!
Me: Sorry, Fiverr says no.

I’m a bit troubled since I changed my gigs to the package-setup, that there seems no possibility at all to limit the allowed gig multiples, this is a real headache, because people can book however many words of my translation gig they want, and that on top with the delivery time staying the same, nevermind if they book only 250 or 20.000 words,
and as far as I can see, my only option is to cancel an order if someone orders more words than I can deliver in a certain time, putting things like ‘more than x words only with prior contact’ in the description don´t work in all cases, because some people don´t read before they book, and having to cancel orders because of that seems a bit unneeded, if one could just avoid it by having a limitation option.
So, an option to turn off or to set a number for the gig multiples ‘booking-click-thing’, like we have the option to limit the ‘allowed orders in queue’, would help a lot.
Also, people are still missing the fiverrcast transcripts, I just tried and still get the

I have a suggestion to help improve the Fiverr experience for Buyers:
add a nickname field and encourage everyone to give a real human being person name, to help facilitate human interaction.
User names can be pretty out there. I mean, like Tim Robbins in Bull Durham out there. Many Sellers don’t know what to call their Buyers, and vice versa.
By including nick names, Buyers and Sellers will incline more toward seeing each other as people, and this should help make transactions run more smoothly.
In conclusion, my question is:
How much is Fiverr going to pay me for this brilliant suggestion?
Thank you,
Blaise

Yep, hope they fix it soon. Anything lower than 5 stars, I contact the buyer and ask. 99% it's the bug lol

I would like to ask something about multiple gigs. I have a writing gig, and when someone order a multiple gig the delivery time stays the same. For example I have a 500 word in 24 hours but sometimes people order 10xbasic gig, so the order will appear with 5.000 words but still a 24 hours delivery. I wrote in my description that for more words they need to order the according gig or to contact me, but not everyone read the description.
Why don’t implement an option to turn off or to set a number for the gig multiples ‘booking-click-thing’, like we have the option to limit the 'allowed orders in queue?

I felt a webcam quality video might reflect poorly on me as a seller. However, after listening to this podcast, I’ve decided I should do one anyway. My favorite points in this podcast were: A video will help you sell. Use it to connect with the audience and call attention to your gig extras. Write a script before you record the video so you can make it succinct and to the point. Thanks again. I look forward to more podcasts on this topic.",N/A,"Nov 9, 2017 5:36 pm",2020-08-12 23:40:10.218668

As a voice actor myself, nothing will make more of an impact for your gig video than your voice. In my original fiverr video I had a raw, personal introduction as Redd stated but in my updated video, I just went right to the vocals. Still my voice but the demos highlight what I’ve done promote what I can do for them. The reason for this is because after years of vo and video production and analysis, it’s been realized that the first 7-10 seconds will either grab the client and have them wanting more or have them click away to the next seller.
The next thing is to have a High Definition image(s). That’s basic “attention to detail” and shouldn’t be ignored even though the gig is for voiceover. Everything about how you present yourself is or will eventually become your brand. Maintain control of it by controlling every aspect of your video.

Fiverr Ambassador",1,"Reply to @jcmcbride:
Hey there! In answer to your questions:
I monitor everything ha! The tool I built myself (mentioned briefly in the podcast) allows me to track how long each gig takes me and calculate an hourly, daily and weekly rate based on the time/revenue inputs. I find the more you track, the smarter you work.
I think the key to a good extra is having it as a ‘progression’ from your base gig. If the extra is a ‘natural’ fit for your base service, it’s probably more likely to be ordered.
To give you an example, one of my gigs is “I will improve your website with 10 tips” (which is a hand-typed report). An extra on that is “I will video review your website”. That’s a natural progression based on the initial service. However, if I went a bit too far out-of-the-box and offered “I will tweet your website to 10,000 people” as an extra it is probably a bit too unrelated, in regards to the initial base gig, to be suitable for my target market. It would probably still convert in some way but not as well as a more natural progression.
On the flip side of that, you want to try and avoid an obvious extra, as you’re wasting an extra space. An example of that is, “I will record a 100 word voiceover”, with your extra being “I will record another 100 words”. It’s such a clear upgrade that we could just order your base gig with a 2x quantity, meaning we’ve “wasted” our extra space to provide something a user didn’t necessarily know we offer (maybe, in that scenario, some audio cleanup/mixing?)
Fiverr provides you with tools to see how many ‘extras’ you sell, so tracking that can make you determine how good the extra is and which scenario it fits into, i.e:
An obvious extra
A natural progression
Not appropriate for your target audience
Regards,

Fiverr Staff",21,"Entrepreneurs, why do you do what you do? What is it that makes you take the leap from the safety of a 9 to5 to become your own boss and work on your own terms? We at Fiverr want to know what drives you, inspires you, and makes you hustle day in and day out.
In an effort to answer these questions, the Fiverr team first embarked on a cross-country road trip to meet real-life doers and community members across America. We loved it so much, we traveled across the pond to meet global doers in the UK. Now, we’re back on home turf and headed to the best coast…
Announcing the next leg of our #DoersAcrossTheGlobe world tour, California! We’re traveling to key cities in Southern California to meet with Fiverr community members, celebrate local entrepreneurs, and have a blast along the way.
Join us to socialize, network, and build stronger relationships with your local community of doers and entrepreneurs. We’ll be there to chat, talk business and strategy, and mix and mingle. Food and drink will be provided, and we’ll be giving away some awesome Fiverr swag. Act quickly – space is limited.

I do like to sleep in and get up when I want and hop on to Fiverr and see what people who need my services await me there. I do like working in my comfy clothes and shoes.

Fiverr Staff",21,"Entrepreneurs, why do you do what you do? What is it that makes you take the leap from the safety of a 9 to5 to become your own boss and work on your own terms? We at Fiverr want to know what drives you, inspires you, and makes you hustle day in and day out.
In an effort to answer these questions, the Fiverr team first embarked on a cross-country road trip to meet real-life doers and community members across America. We loved it so much, we traveled across the pond to meet global doers in the UK. Now, we’re back on home turf and headed to the best coast…
Announcing the next leg of our #DoersAcrossTheGlobe world tour, California! We’re traveling to key cities in Southern California to meet with Fiverr community members, celebrate local entrepreneurs, and have a blast along the way.
Join us to socialize, network, and build stronger relationships with your local community of doers and entrepreneurs. We’ll be there to chat, talk business and strategy, and mix and mingle. Food and drink will be provided, and we’ll be giving away some awesome Fiverr swag. Act quickly – space is limited.

Fiverr Staff",11,"There is a long story about getting this episode to publish. First off, the laptop that had the final version of the podcast on it was stolen the night before we were set to publish! We were able to recover the original recordings and eventually piece together the episode, so thank you everyone for your patience.
This is very much a “pilot” episode for us. We learned a lot about the format and content and I can tell you that as we recorded episode 2, I felt like we’ve made great progress to a better version. I’m excited to grow and shape the podcast to the communities needs.
Look for Episode 2 next week, April 4th! With subsequent episodes every 2 weeks after that: April 18th, May 2nd, May 16th, May 30th, etc, etc. Thanks for listening and of course, give us feedback about what you’d like to hear about in future podcasts!",N/A,"Mar 28, 2017 12:39 pm",2020-08-12 23:42:55.048149

I was wondering if their would be any support for a casual meet up/networking event in Brussels?
I would like to meet other doers and have a talk about how you guys do business and enjoy life as freelancers. (curious buyers are welcome too of course!)
All the current events seems to be in the US, and according to a poll here on the forum, 80% of us want to go to a Fiverr event if available in our area. So maybe we should make it available?
Anyway I would love to hear if anyone is up to the idea!

In my spreadsheets I keep track of my buyers, all my orders and their corresponding earnings, I made my own charts, made automated statistics about everything, etc.
And I enter all the info of each order in those spreadsheets, since I received my first order on Fiverr - never stopped using Excel, and I don’t see any reason why since it’s fast, it’s a single app hence no memory consumption, and it’s become second nature to me.
P.S. I know, Fiverr already provides most of what I do in my spreadsheets, but those features came too late for me, and it’s easier to continue keeping track of everything inside Excel.",N/A,"Jun 13, 2017 2:31 pm",2020-08-12 23:43:14.123236

Western food is fine, but it’s not as exotic. I’m always arguing with my dad about putting spices on meat or chicken.

Transcript for this episode: http://blog.fiverr.com/?p=21015 179",N/A,1,"Dec 28, 2016 1:55 pm",akoscreative,9,"Hello
I recently checked whether Fiverr is the best platform for freelancers who wan to start small.
I came across other platforms similar to Fiverr. I was particularly interested in learning more because I suddenly felt Fiverr’s 20% fee hurts after all especially if you have worked on projects that took hours and days to complete. not that we charge much on Fiverr but the fee makes your already weary eyes teary when you decide to take a pause and check you earnings.
none the less, I really like Fiverr’s platform and interface. there are new Buyer requests all the time and it now feel like a community to me.
So, what is the best attitude for a Seller if she/he wants to grow and make the best of what Fiverr offer.
Or will Sellers be better off adding on top of their fees to Buyers, that 20% fee charged to them.
What are other Sellers doing that seems to help.

For me, Fiverr acts as my agent and almost as a business manager, not to mention my SEO expert and my overall marketing team. Fiverr brings so much great business to me that I otherwise wouldn’t have access to, unless I hired other people to handle all those tasks or tried to do them myself. At the end of the day, I feel like 20% is a reasonable cost of business for everything Fiverr provides me. I do voiceover gigs, so I’m not sure whether my experience transfers well to other types of work.",N/A,"Feb 17, 2016 1:04 pm",2020-08-12 23:44:31.365112

Are you guys planning to give a feature to accept or reject an order in near future?
I think this is a great idea. I sometimes get orders that don’t fit my skill set, or where the buyer never completes the order. I have to cancel them, which affects my rating.

Then more than 4 months later, on July 19, 2017, Season 2 Episode 2 came out. We had another new co-host, with no acknowledgment of what happened to the previous co-host.
There appear to be no transcripts for Season 2 of Fiverrcast.
What’s going on? Why is this thus? What is the reason for this thusness?
Is this confusion and uncertainty just Standard Operating Procedure, or may we hope for Transparency and Stability in the future?",N/A,"Jul 27, 2017 3:20 pm",2020-08-12 23:44:53.601793

have you contacted Fiverr about this event? Or is it 100% you?
Also it’s not super clear as to what it is you will be doing.
You want TRS to network and talk, sure. But to what end?
Or you want low-level sellers to meet TRS?
So far the only thing that’s clear is that you will be doing a presentation of some sort.
It would be great if you also shared some more info re: what it is you will be talking about.
If this is a Fiverr event, I wouldn’t mind booking a flight out of pocket and being there if it meant helping people.

Yes, I have contacted Fiverr about it and they are also helping me with getting attention of local sellers in Bucharest. The purpose of this event is to meetup and network. It’s completely free and anyone could join. You don’t need to be even TRS or Level Seller.
I will be giving also the presentation about what worked best in order to become the top rated seller. I am also planning to organize a workshop and it will be specifically on modifying or creating gig that will catch buyers attention. If you see on my page, I have the video made for my gigs so I want to help other people with video creation too and we can also record in the room there for anyone who is wishing to upgrade their video. Also the purpose is to meet other sellers and hear their experience with Fiverr.",N/A,"May 18, 2017 7:41 pm",2020-08-12 23:45:19.341765

I wasn’t aware Fiverr held such meets.
Most of the time Fiverr doesn’t hold them, you do in your community. There is a community team at Fiverr who will assist you in getting started (and they are great).
Anybody can start one in their community (unless I’m missing something).
I’m one of the people doing events in Los Angeles, and there are other LA groups (because it’s a huge city).
Happening all over… and if not in your area, start one!
Suggestion: Check out the other “Events” where this poll is located and see if anybody else in your area is already doing it. If not then start one yourself, and post yours in the “Events” section. It can start small, then grow. Here in LA, we are having a blast at ours (plus being very productive).",N/A,"Jul 11, 2017 2:55 am",2020-08-12 23:45:38.301711

I haven’t heard of any Fiverr events in Eastern Europe.
I suspect there are some, but I have no idea.
That said, YOU can start one if you wish… There are “official” Fiverr events occasionally, but I know the Fiverr team is working hard to have the community events grow too.
Those are organized and run at the local level. I don’t work for Fiverr, I just am one of the people involved in the Los Angeles group.
It does provide an interesting perspective when you meet others working to grow their business too. It can be informal (meeting next week at XXX location) or in our case, we have settled on the 3rd Thursday of each month.
But that is how we want to do it, you might do it once every other month, or twice a month.
Don’t wait for someone else to make it happen, you do it! (Just suggesting… your call.)",N/A,"Jul 11, 2017 12:25 pm",2020-08-12 23:45:40.126890

Transcript for this episode: http://blog.fiverr.com/?p=21328 256",N/A,1,"Dec 28, 2016 1:59 pm",tommy_graphics,5,"Negative reviews aren’t good. You should do everything your ability to provide a totally awesome product and earn every gold star you can. But even if you get a review of less than five stars, you can make that work for you. Now, I’m not telling you to lie - telling fibs is bad, so this doesn’t mean offer crap service and you’ll come out looking fine. Because you won’t: more than a few bad reviews, no matter how you handle them, and you’ll find your sales dwindling.
But, assuming that you’ve done everything in your power to be an awesome seller and your client just wasn’t willing to give you a chance to make it right and left you a bad review, here’s how to handle it: be nice, be honest, and don’t be a jerk.
Bad reviews can work for you because although every client who visits your gigs will read the reviews, every client will specifically look for the bad reviews. This means that you’re given an opportunity in your bad reviews to leave a message that EVERY new client will see. For example, a client recently left me a three-star review that took me down from 5.0 to 4.9. Not a big deal, but still - I’d rather have a perfect record.
But that review was an opportunity for me to say, “Naturally I’m disappointed that I couldn’t earn your five-star review. You ordered 5 minutes but I actually gave you 8 minutes to provide all the details I found in your short reading. Again, I’m sorry the answer wasn’t what you were hoping for but I did my very best to work with the cards I pulled.” See what I did there? I didn’t attack the seller, I just explained how I over-delivered (more time than was ordered) and I show my dedication to my client, regardless of how small a purchase he or she made. If you handle bad reviews correctly, you can make them work for you. But don’t lie about things you didn’t do, and don’t be a jerk even if the client deserves it.",N/A,"Apr 17, 2017 3:48 am",2020-08-12 23:46:26.764479

Never use silly samples for them. Just use attractive samples.
Make a attractive description which is better than Top Raters Descriptions.
Don’t add any high quality or high performance gig extras.
Find few popular gigs which match to your gig. Check gigs tags and use better tags for yours.
Don’t send messages for ‘‘Buyers Requests’’ tab, It is just wasting time. They won’t give you any job easily.
Give them Bonus with the delivery (according to your industry)",N/A,"May 13, 2017 4:00 pm",2020-08-12 23:46:31.250301

I dont want to say country name, But I really hate those seller.
Its really tough to find out a good seller .",N/A,"May 17, 2017 1:43 am",2020-08-12 23:46:50.907850

My name is Charles, and I am a Fiverr seller, aka Silberma1976. I am excited to announce what has been months in the making: The first ever Washington, DC Fiverr community mixer!!!
This is a chance for fellow Fiverr’s and Sellers to connect, network, and pick each other’s brains (not like a zombie). This is what we hope will be the first of many events to come, including some more educational ones. But, we wanted to start with something light and fun to let everyone meet in person!
The Information about the mixer is below. This for any Fiverr seller or buyer in the DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virgina Area). Look for me or another seller, Allie who has helped make this happen. Look forward to seeing you there!

I am a seller who wanted a FIverr community in my area, was able to connect with the Community person at Fiverr who helps start these communities and advocated for it to happen. You could say, I am the founding father (pun intended) of the DC Fiverr community.
Ooops.
If you click on the link in the post, you will see the invite is from Fiverr.

Just posting on other people’s pages and posting your links to irrelevant groups isn’t the way to go. You have to build a sense of ‘community’ on your own page and drive traffic there. If you are participating in ethical marketing techniques, you will never get restricted or blocked. I always hear about people’s accounts being ‘hacked’ but I tend to find that these are excuses for poor behavior in your marketing and also not sure how people’s social media accounts get ‘hacked’ if they aren’t worth anything?",N/A,"Oct 4, 2015 2:00 am",2020-08-12 23:48:26.469380
