Thank you for your reply.
I have checked my settings, but there doesn’t seem to be anything relevant to that matter, that I could change. There is a list of my logins, though, showing the exact same data each time, same device, same browser. Still the last login is always marked as “new device”, which makes no sense.
As for your other questions: I do allow cookies for Fiverr, but like all cookies are deleted at shutdown or by an occasional clean up process, which is something normal everybody should do. I certainly wouldn’t change that. And no, I never permit my location. Both of these things shouldn’t matter anyway, when I’m logging in from the same computer with the same browser over the same provider from the same connection.
So, if Fiverr security is based on me giving up all my security on my part then these false messages about a “new logins” will have to keep coming. I’m going to wait and see, if Fiverr will block me at some point or not.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 2:50 pm",2020-08-20 18:49:22.552225

I think most buyers are knowledgeable enough to figure out if reviews are fake. I am a seller and a buyer on Fiverr. I read not only the reviews of the seller, but I look at the buyer’s profile. If the buyer has reviews from the seller, then I know the reviews are more than likely fake.
Also, many buyers and sellers with questionable accounts and claim to be US citizens will soon be losing their accounts due to Fiverr’s new requirement that they prove they are US citizens by submitting a W9 tax form with their Social Security number on it.

Aside from negative reviews, anything over 3.0 stars is pretty much useless to the algo.

Your Fiverr Experience
You have been working on fiverr for a very Long time with your gig usually being very high on the search list and suddenly, some OTHER new persons gig comes in and pushes your gig to the last page.(Not trying to be rude in anyway but it’s unfair how people have been on fiverr for so Long with a well maintained gig suddenly being pushed down by a new guy with no orders or barely any click and impressions. poll
PLEASE READ - Unable to find gig in search SOLVED
Conversations
There are about 15 posts a day from sellers (mostly new) who are saying they cannot find their gigs in search. I did a little experiment with my own gigs and found something out. You can search your gig and find it at the bottom then the next search can find it at the top. Gigs can disappear. One time I searched my gig and filtered it down to find it easier. It was nowhere to be found. I tried again 10 minutes later with the same filters and it was in the middle. “Ranking” doesn’t matt…

I am from Guyana and i have been directing thousands of individuals towards fiverr.
I only recently had complaints from many persons about the same issues.
#1 the area code for Guyana is 592 fiverr currently has 595
This would make it impossible for them to verify…
The next thing is more scary
#2 Every time someone complains about it the disable the account.
This is a very unfair business practice…
It is called discrimination…
Very Sad that fiverr a company that for the last three years I have sent so many persons too is doing this to the persons that help build their network. Which btw is getting very slow as of late.
I am hoping that they fix this issue as I will start redirecting persons from my network which now has over 200,000 people in it. most of which are Freelancers on the international market place.
FIX IT Please as it will be viewed as discrimination against third world countries. Thank You…",N/A,"Mar 29, 2017 4:41 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:59.599623

The best characteristic on my case is that I already made the verification when I registered, several months ago, and now that I am selling my gigs and want to withdraw they request this verification thing The SMS never comes, and if you try to make the verification through QR Code it is the same shit. The redirect you to a login page and when you try to login they don’t recognise your password.
After several attempts you try to reset password. NO, wrong Answer, they want the sms verification code to change password. and if you are alrteady loged in they just send you to homepage.
With few wordsa TOTAL MESS and no any solution.
I contacted the support and she sais “Clean cockies”. Hell no. I can clean cookies al day, I can open a cookie cleaning company if you want but as long as the SMS doesn’t come to my mobile I want be able to verify this f****** profile.
For sure for all the clients that comes from fiverr I will surely suggest them direct payment by offering a huge first payment discount!

Understanding Response Time & Response Rate
Responsiveness refers to the tracking of a Fiverr seller’s response rate (what percentage of inbox messages you reply to within twenty four hours) as well as your response time (how quickly you respond to a new request in your inbox). Replying within 24 hours is necessary for your response to be tracked. Response time is based on the last 60 days of a seller’s activity and tracks the amount of time it takes for a seller to respond when first contacted by a user.
Inbox messages and orders are different topic.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 8:32 am",2020-08-20 18:52:08.253144

Though really if some are wrong (I think someone else said on the forum their response time was a lot of days and CS fixed it), surely Fiverr could run a fix on all the response times and fix any bug.

You and such sellers same as you are very problem in the marketplace. You are spamming continuously.
As a result good sellers are facing may problems and bring bad reputation against own country.
This is very Disappointing incident.
You should fleeing shame !
For you ( such as same as yours) , freelancing marketplace plays new rules, new bindings for protecting spamming.
That’s why experienced freelancers going through many problems instead of relax work.
So stop it !!!

I do not make enough to fall into the category of sellers that need to fill out a W-9 form.
Regardless, every Us citizen must fill out the W9. Please read this notice by Fiverr. The first FAQ explains it.
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/w-9-collection
the_mad_duck:
Will my gigs be locked if I don’t complete it,
This is what the thread said
W-9 US Verification Requirement
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
the_mad_duck:
even though I don’t make enough to matter?
It does not matter if you do not make $20,000. The W9 must be filled out. Fiverr will send 1099 to the relevant tax authority only if you make $20,000.
W-9 US Verification Requirement
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.

I know that the current situation in the world might cause that but I can’t understand why did I stop receiving any message? In March and April combined I received around 40-50 messages and, as I said, since this problem started I haven’t got a single message.
And when I search my gig sometimes it’s on the last page and other times I can not even find it.
Spamming “thank you” in every topic about this bug won’t help anyone.
We have to make Fiverr the best place for freelancers together and pointing out to the issues is one step closer to that goal.
Please don’t unpin this topic as you did with the last one.
We need everyone’s voice to be heard!

But they don’t/didn’t. Before they changed the website code to show “N/A” for everything, the most recent few days were showing 0 for everyone. So the most recent days totals were getting either stored as 0 or null or not being stored at all in the place in the db the analytics page looks (reads) to show them, and still are likely not (otherwise they’d have removed the code that shows “N/A” in every field). So I don’t really think it’s just a “display issue”. ie. the more recent figures are wrong somewhere in the database (even if they’re right/stored in some other place).
So I’d say the correct daily totals for clicks etc. can’t be stored in the database currently for the days since it went wrong (started showing 0 for everyone). But it’s possible that there’s another table/file where the values needed to create those daily totals and that that is working okay (though it’s strange that it’s not been fixed so far).",N/A,"May 17, 2020 3:14 am",2020-08-20 18:54:13.109108

Why are sellers treated this way? And for those claiming nothing wrong with the algorithm… The algorithm is about programming for God sake, an error can occur on the program which causes algorithm to misfunction, that’s why we have debugging in programming in order to fix issue in a program…

He has his opinion that people should do things to try to improve their gigs and situation on their own. There is some merit in that. I realize people seem to be in a panic right now.
As I said, every time someone on the forum is saying their gigs have disappeared:
they are delivering orders currently or have orders in their queue
or
They cannot find their own gigs since they don’t know how to search for them.
I haven’t tried looking at people’s gigs for everyone who complains, only about 6 sellers. I did find one who was correct that his gigs were not on the first four pages.
The rest had their gigs displayed and I found them within less than ten seconds.

I am affected by this – and have been many times over the past few years. This is nothing new, and it does not stop a good seller from being successful. I have learned how to work withing the system, and I have learned how to overcome the obstacles. I am trying to help other people think for themselves, and learn to overcome these obstacles as well.
Just because the loud voices, that like to complain, don’t want to listen, doesn’t make me wrong, or the facts untrue. This is nothing new. The algorithm is working, and it is normal for gigs to rotate – and yes, move to the last page from time to time. This has happened to me half a dozen times or more over the past few years, and my gigs have always rotated back over time.
Be patient, learn to adapt, and please stop complaining as if this is the end of the world. It isn’t.

As you all I am facing the same issue. My gig was on the first page and now I can’t even find it in first 10 pages. No new clients no new messages. Then I messaged fiverr team and they told me my gig is totally fine. So I was really confused by not knowing what actually happened. Then I thought I should act positively.
If fiverr says they are working on it, surely they will be doing so. We have nothing to do with that. I don’t remember they waited us this much in the past few years. They might be facing some practical issues in this pandemic. That might be the reason for taking it this longer.
So these are the things I did
I update all my gigs again. Then I found out some gigs have lack of keywords and some have unwanted and wrong keywords
And I saw that fiverr has given a new place to put your “SEO TITLE”. Some of you might know about this already. If not, please go and update your SEO TITLE today.
Then I update the FAQ for many of my gigs. I hope it might help your client to understand your service much better.
Here is the most important thing. I saw my gig description works fine on desktop but not on mobile devices. Some of my gigs didn’t have spaces between paragraphs when it comes to mobile view. But it was totally fine in desktop view. We all know now everybody uses mobile. So this will have a real effect in your gigs.
Also, I take few fiverr tests related to my service. So I could verify few of my skills
And one last thing I did was, I spent a few bucks on “Learn from fiverr” tutorials related to my service to upgrade my skills. I must say these tutorials are Amazing. Specially tutorials from Mr. Daniel Walter Scott was excellent. I invite you to watch these tutorials and you will thank me one day. Also, you will get few badges at the end as a bonus and they will be displayed on your profile forever.

As the message in the orange bar clearly indicates, your gig’s ability to gain metrics, and appearance in the search results have absolutely nothing to do with the display issue on your Gigs page.
The message clearly states:
“No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.”

Not lots compared to the total number of sellers on Fiverr. They’re just loud on the forum, but then again, you have a similar loud group every now and then. They blame the change in algorithm, the holidays, this change, that change… And sales come and go, no matter what, and it can happen to sellers of any level.
Many sellers are still getting sales (just look at all the topics about their first sale, their first $1000, whatever).

I don’t see why all of these people are “a loud group” when some are top sellers.
I call them the loud group because there’s always a loud group complaining about not getting sales, and because they keep saying the same thing, you get the impression that their number is huge, even though there are sellers who keep getting sales (but they don’t come to the forum to repeatedly say that).

Fiverr has told everyone what is happening. They stated it quite clearly in the orange bar on your Gigs page. They have said that there is a metrics display issue, which they are working on fixing, but that display issue has nothing to do with the active status of gigs, or any gig’s appearance in the search algorithm. You know what is happening. There is nothing else that Fiverr needs to tell you.
shimizuhiroshi1:

Not at all. Fiverr’s “silence” likely just means that they haven’t been able to fix the errors yet.

It’s working for you Great. Isn’t working for many of Us That’s it.
I experience the same things all the loud voices are complaining about right now. I am not immune just because I am a Fiverr veteran. The search algorithm affects us all equally. The difference is, I work with the system, instead of complaining when it doesn’t do what I want or make me more visible than someone else. There are thousands of people who want to be on the first page of search results, but there isn’t room for them on that page. This is why the system rotates all gigs (based upon internal factors we do not need to know about).
If you are rotated “to the last page”, be patient, and you will likely be rotated back. This has happened to me many times over the past few years. Yes, it happens to me, and no, I am not complaining about it over and over here on the forums – like the current loud voices are.
This is how the search algorithm works.
sameed_webdev:
We aren’t getting any response from Buyers .
It is a terribly irresponsible concept to expect the Fiverr search system to work in your favor, and provide you with all of your orders. If you aren’t getting the kind of orders you want from the search system, then please take responsibility for your own success, and market and promote your gigs to your target customers – on your own – wherever they may be located. All businesses have to do this. Here on Fiverr, you are a businessman too, so I don’t understand why hard self-motivated work doesn’t apply to the loud voices here, on the forums?
Fiverr says the search system is working like it should. This clarification is clearly posted on everyone’s Gigs page. As Fiverr clearly states, the analytics display error has nothing to do with gigs being active, and functioning properly, within the search system.
sameed_webdev:
Kindly Take into consideration what others are going through.
I am well aware of the nature of the complaints being voiced here. Complaints, however, do not equal truth, especially when Fiverr has clearly spelled out the nature of the error (and it’s connection to anything else). Complaining about something that Fiverr says is not broken, is not going to result in the search system being changed to adhere to the demands being voiced here.
Please be patient. The analytics DISPLAY ERROR will be fixed when Fiverr fixes it.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 4:32 pm",2020-08-20 18:55:07.492098

Look at the statistics issue for over 3 weeks, Fiverr is yet to rectify it and that same time alot of sellers complaining of missing gig, I did a test above in which I told you to carry out but you seem not interested because you know something is wrong with the system.

more than 100+ Peoples Complaining on forum that There gig is not appearing on search
Please share your source for this number of people complaining. I’ve been around, here on the forums for years, and it doesn’t look like any more people now, than those who are usually complaining about this sort of thing in the past. The issue is a DISPLAY error. It has nothing to do with a gig’s ability to perform. As Fiverr states – clearly – on everyone’s Gigs page, all gigs are still gaining analytics, those analytics just aren’t being DISPLAYED. Gigs and the algorithm are working just fine.
vidvox:
Because Like me Many Other Peoples Follow Gig Analytics Page Because its Really Helps us a lot to check How Our Gigs are performing.
I don’t know. It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success. The analytics stats are just numbers. Success does not depend upon those numbers. Success depends upon the ACTIONS sellers take, and, as far as I’ve seen, most of the sellers complaining about the display error, are also the same sellers that aren’t taking any productive ACTIONS to become successful.
Analytics stats will not guarantee success. Sitting around and watching numbers rise and fall won’t result in profitable gigs. Stop staring at the numbers, and start doing research, promotion, marketing, experimentation, taking risks, etc.

Stats Are Important Because That’s How We Know Our Gigs Performance. That’s How we Know How Many Views Clicks or Impressions We Got After Sharing Our Gig. Stats Clearly Tells Us the Working of Our Gig. Also Fiver Algorithms Depend on Stats. Right Now Fiver algorithms did not get any response from Stats and That’s why Many Buyers Facing Issues in Gig Rotation. A Person has Only 2-3 Sales and he is in Best Selling page No 15 and A Person has 2000+ Sales with 5* Rating he is No where in Best Selling. Surely That’s a Problem Mate.

None of this guarantees that you (specifically, in relation to your argument) are entitled to have your gigs appear on the first page of search results. Fiverr does not guarantee any gig placement in the search results, and they do not guarantee orders – to anyone – just because they have gigs or high ratings on Fiverr.

Actually, you can’t lose something you never had. It is a false presumption that you can lose money that you have not yet earned. You are not losing money, you are losing time by complaining about something here, on the forums, that has no connection to how your gig performs in the search results.

I am on fiverr from 2 years.
Like Me Many Users, I also Used analytics page to See their progress and That’s How we see our gig performance and that’s how we Speed up our Marketing and sharing policies in order to gain good impressions and Get some Good Response From Buyer.
My Question is Very Simple . Like You and 2 Other Persons in this forum , You are Saying Stats are Useless and This is Just a Display Issue . I Mean If Stats Are Working then why Fiverr Taking so much time to Resolve a display Issue? Even a Person who build website for 50$ knows how to Resolve Display issues and Fiverrr a millionaire Company Does not know how to resolve display issue???
Surely its not a display issue its more than this that’s why a millionaire company is struggling from weeks to sort out. Our Demand is Simple Fiverr Has Given us a Option to Keep track of our gigs performance ad activity and Previously with that it was working fine. Now If That option is hurting many sellers like me its our Right to ask fiverr to resolve this issue. My argument is not with you and I Have not started this with you. But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
Lastly Fiverr is Open for all its not mine or yours only property to work with. We work with sellers Give them Revisions and After a bunch of Hard work we get only 4$ , on the other hand without too much work fiverr take 3$ from per order . So If you calculate this , it will come up as a million dollar daily fiverr gets. So then They should show some maturity , Have capacity of bearing New Customers and They should be able to sort out Bugs like this.
These all are my opinion and way of thinking. If You and any person don’t like I am sorry and Please accept my apologize in advance. Thank you",N/A,"May 22, 2020 4:40 am",2020-08-20 18:55:42.058296

But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
I am not wrong, because I am expressing the exact comments Fiverr themselves have stated. Fiverr specifically says, on every seller’s Gigs page: ""We’re working on getting your Gigs’ impressions, clicks, and views back online. No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.""
Why is it so hard to believe what Fiverr is telling you?
If Fiverr says this is how things are, then this is how things are. You demanding to be given a different answer does not make Fiverr wrong. Fiverr is not lying to you.
vidvox:
So then They should show some maturity
You need to show some patience. Fiverr will fix the display issue when they fix the issue. You demanding to have what you want, right now, because you think Fiverr is immature, and not working fast enough for you, isn’t going to make them fix things any faster. The display issue will be fixed when it is fixed. Fiverr told you this. I am telling your this. And plenty of other forum users have told you this.
Your opinions are not how things work. I have proven this with Fiverr’s own statement on the issue. Everyone else can see the same exact Fiverr statement on their Gigs page. It is what Fiverr says it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 5:14 am",2020-08-20 18:55:43.802977

It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success.
I agree with you jonbaas.
I am curious to know what exactly people do when for example they see their impressions going down. I have seen a lot of threads where people are upset that these go down sometimes. Is there some sure way to make them go back up after they go down?
What kind of control did you have when you could see those stats that affected them and improved them?
Can anyone share how they got those impressions clicks and views to improve?",N/A,"May 22, 2020 5:23 am",2020-08-20 18:55:44.193358

Well, as you know, none of us have control over impressions, so, in all honesty, there’s nothing any of us can do to make them go up again. I just ride out that wave, and let the algorithm do what it does. I don’t live and die by the things I cannot control.

I think people are obsessed with their stats.
I think there’s a big difference between being ‘obsessed’ with stats, and ‘interested’ in stats, yet a lot of the responses I’ve read on this thread suggest that even having a passing interest in stats is foolish and a waste of time. I simply can’t wrap my head around that way of thinking.
Do you need stats to sell? No, of course not. Just like you don’t need money to be happy. But it helps, right? Stats help you to make decisions about your business based on actual metrics, as opposed to speculation.
The metrics in Fiverr are woefully bad as-is. I’d love to know what keywords drove buyers to our gigs. I’d love to know which demos buyers listened to - how many times on average a buyer visited our gig before buying etc etc… All of these are metrics we could be shown, whilst still maintaining buyer privacy, and they would give us actionable insight to make changes to our gigs with.
The fact that Fiverr can’t even give us the absolute basic stats, for almost a month now, is the reason why people, myself included, get frustrated.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 6:26 am",2020-08-20 18:55:47.446640

This is exactly what Google Analytics could bring on table.
Fiverr could implement GA for L2 and TRS. It would be advantage for those who understand data analytics and can use it.
It would be also motivation for L0 and L1 for growth. The reward would be “real” analytics.

Once again I agree. That’s why I suggested that people do what they can to improve their gigs and how they process and deliver orders, as well as improving their skills if needed.
I also think fiverr does choose quality gigs for the first page at least, sometimes.
I mostly pay attention to my own category but skimming through each page of listings it does start to look like there is a descending order to the gigs somehow.

It’s unfortunate if we’ve reached a point where we’re suggesting that we can only achieve quality by hiding useful information from people. That would suggest a total lack of trust.

Well you say why can’t Fiverr trust all sellers.
With respect, you’ve paraphrased me a little there. What I said was that most of us will do the right thing, and for those who don’t, punishments exist to discourage bad behaviour, and I was referring only to being able to see some basic metrics related only to our own gigs, not giving out my username and password to random strangers, which is why I said we’re not quite comparing the same thing.
For clarity, my two pence on this is that Fiverr could and should give us more, higher quality metrics to work with. As Fiverr grows and evolves as a business (now an NYSE listed company, not some tin-pot freelance site), and as we all grow as sellers, why can’t we understand a little more about customer behaviour behind the scenes, when it’s related to our own gigs? That’s evolution. Exploitation will always happen, that’s what sensible risk-mitigation, rules and punishments exist for.

Absolutely agree with you. But something that I feel often gets missed in conversations, is that Fiverr has two sets of customers - the ones who buy the products, and the ones who pay the seller fees. We’re customers of Fiverr too, just a different type. It’s a cliche, but it’s true; without sellers there would be no Fiverr.
And for all the enormous improvements that buyers have seen in the way they interact with the Fiverr platform over the years, I feel that we as sellers haven’t seen quite the same level of improvements.
I’m hopeful that will change, and I’m excited about the Promoted Gigs feature that’s hopefully launching soon. It would make sense to bundle some new metrics in with that, so who knows?",N/A,"May 22, 2020 8:04 am",2020-08-20 18:55:53.245111

I am curious to know what exactly people do when for example they see their impressions going down.
They spam the social media and forums and everything they can with their gig links.

Then why is that so many people complaining about it?Please stop saying it is not a problem…
People are complaining because they think the analytics display issue is related to a gigs activity in the search results and this is not true. Fiverr has said exactly this.
Those who are complaining merely because they cannot see their analytics (which are still being calculated, just not shown), have a valid complaint. Those who are complaining that they think their gigs are failing because of the analytics display issue, are merely wasting time. The two things are not related. By Fiverr’s own statement, the analytics display issue has nothing to do with gigs in the search system. I will continue to remind people that there is no search results problem, until Fiverr specifically says otherwise. I am expressing the truth, as we know it. It is not your place to demand that I do otherwise.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 1:17 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:00.625215

My point is that my sales have been really good since I started my fiverr account and they dropped at the same time Fiverr stopped showing gig impressions. Obviously I am going to think there is a correlation and so will others who are having that same issue.
And, obviously, based upon what Fiverr has said, that would be a wrong assumption.
celebrawitch:
If you aren’t having any problems and doing so well with your business, why do you have so much time to spend on the forums when the problem doesn’t even concern you?
I choose to be here, and I choose to dedicate some of my time each day to help others. I also stand against misinformation – as I have, on the forum, for years. Just because I am successful with my sales, does not mean I should stop interacting here. My continued hope is that there are people who ARE willing to listen to reason, wisdom, and my expert advice… and those who listen can become as successful as I, and other veteran sellers, have become.
In fact, over the years, many sellers have thanked me for sharing my advice and insight here on the forums. I am honored to have been a part of the success many other former new sellers are now experiencing. If YOU don’t want to listen, that’s fine… clearly you don’t want to be helped right now.
celebrawitch:
Perhaps you shouldn’t give unsolicited advice when you don’t even know someone’s situation.
That’s the thing, though, in large part, I DO know the situations of most who are complaining. I’ve been here for years, and I have seen just about everything. I have also experienced what the loud voices are complaining about, and I have learned from those experience. It would be wonderful it those who are complaining about things that aren’t even true, would stop and look at the situation objectively, and realize that what they are doing is expending needless energy that could be better invested in becoming better sellers.
celebrawitch:
I did not need your patronizing reply.
And I, respectfully, don’t need you to be telling me not to stand up for reason, and voice an alternate perspective of things. This is a discussion forum… a civil discourse. If you want to believe what isn’t true, that’s fine, but it is not appropriate for you to say that I cannot oppose that misinformation.
I’m here to help those who are willing to listen.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 1:50 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:01.445138

Fiverr to tell sellers the whole truth about the issues they are facing?
Why do you assume Fiverr is lying? What reason would they have to lie about the search system? They’re not going to tell how HOW it works (that is proprietary information), so what do you hope to get out of this argument? Fiverr says the system is working, and gigs are still interacting in the system as they are supposed to… It is not broken merely because some sellers currently have their gigs in rotation, and don’t like it. I’ve had my gigs in rotation many times too, and yet, here I am… finding ways to earn sales. My gigs have bounced back numerous times. Yours will too.
bodmas:
what are you trying to achieve or your aim?
I have explained my aim in my previous post.
bodmas:
You expect Fiverr to say there is a search results issue till you believe…
I trust Fiverr, because there is no reason not to. Even when things aren’t going my way, I work on my gigs, I market, I promote, and I do what I need to do to remain relevant and successful. Complaining achieves nothing. Actions to better a struggle do.
bodmas:

Very well. Be emotional. That doesn’t, however, make you right, when Fiverr has already stated the nature of the situation, and that it does not affect what you and others are complaining about.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 2:06 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:01.879952

This was the case everything was started. It seems like most of the sellers who had this experience on April 29th cannot remember it anymore. According to my opinion some sellers like me are still getting zero impressions, though the stats are not shown (though fiverr says it’s only a display issue, it’s not like that for the sellers who had this experience since April 29th). Zero impressions probably affect for the gig ranking. Sellers who didn’t experience the zero impression situation are not affected and their gigs are appearing on the search results as usual.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/4/5/4/454f2c6f68b463882714cb8850a1a5e47a4fefeb.jpeg,"May 22, 2020 2:24 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:02.810638

According to my opinion some sellers like me are still getting zero impressions, though the stats are not shown
You don’t know what your stats are in the last month. How do you know that you’re “still getting zero impressions”? It sounds like you’re trying to mold your emotion-based opinion into fact, and you just don’t have any actual facts to support your opinion.
Complaining about an opinion that is not sourced by facts seems like a pointless endeavor.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 2:30 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:03.660380

I have seen your reply comments in every thread.
This would be another emotion-based opinion. I don’t comment on every thread. I would guess that my comments are on less than 1% of all new topics on the forum. I pick and choose which discussions I participate in. Please don’t make assumptions like this.
top_engineer:
But all your comments shows that you have no any experience about this Zero impression situation started from April 29.
Actually, if you took the time to read my comments, you would see that I have stated – many times – that I have experienced – many times over the years – EXACTLY what you are complaining about. Your complaints are nothing new, just as what you are experiencing is nothing new.

I’ve asked him if its a natural rotation or really a bug, because the rotation happened at the same time the gig analytics went offline. I’m still in doubt but I trust my friend about this, he said there’s a time that our gig will be on the last page for maybe a month, but it’ll go back as it is, and fiverr will give you a chance to shine again. I hope this comment will help ease my fellow freelancers. and I hope we can get back to the track as soon as possible. Cheers to us! and Godbless to us all.

This is because Fiverr gig rotation is based on the information fed into it by the gig analytics.

I have seen a gig with 1star review on the first page of a niche in Fiverr. First page with 1 star review and 1 order for weeks.
I have noticed a lot of new gigs on the first page now too. It’s impossible to figure out how gigs are rotated.
Clearly there is much more than gig analytics determining where gigs are placed. Because those gigs must have terrible analytics aside from massive impressions which who knows why they deserve that.
I’ve seen new gigs without orders which never get orders stay on the first page month after month for no reason I could see, then later the person became a top rated seller, so there are things which fiverr likes about a gig that have nothing to do with how many orders it gets, or how new it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 10:19 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:10.955134

Yes. However, impressions do not stay the same. They move up and down. Also, I’ve seen that simply editing a gig will set it back in the ranks. So to say you edit a gig trying to get more impressions would, based on my own experience, tend to backfire and do the opposite of what you hope for.

There are a lot of opinions about what is going on, so rather than sharing my opinion I’ll share my experience.
I originally saw my impressions drop to 0 randomly after having climbed up to around 90 a day beginning around the 28th of April.
I have had my most productive month-long period so far from halfway through April to about a week ago, with 27 orders overall and around 13 inquiries per day. I was getting so many orders that I marked myself as “out of office” for the better part of a week and a half to slow down. When I came back, my first day began with about 4 new inquiries and nothing else. Since then, I have received absolutely nothing, no messages or orders from new buyers (I’ve had two messages from returning buyers but no orders).
That is my experience. I’ve found my gig on the very last page of search results for about a week, so it’s searchable, but almost impossible to find.
As for my opinion, I want to believe it’s the system glitching but I’m just not sure. I heard there was a gig rotation around the same time so it might just be that. Nevertheless, I feel like an international company should be able to have fixed this glitch within a few days, let alone a month. Being new to Fiverr, I’m really not in much of a position to criticize, but I really hope this is a fluke and not how Fiverr normally operates, keeping us all in the dark like this.
If anyone more experienced has info on how Fiverr normally works it would be much appreciated! Have a great day/night everyone",N/A,"May 24, 2020 11:26 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:26.027303

Hello, you may have shot yourself in the foot by going out of office for a week and a half. I’m just guessing but that can sometimes lead to a slowdown in orders when you come back.
You also mentioned April 28 which seems to be about the time others report a slowdown. So it’s not possible to tell what happened in any particular case.
My theory is that there has been such an influx of new sellers that things are being adjusted to account for that.
If you check the number of sellers in any category now you will probably see a staggering amount of new sellers.
It’s a highly competitive site now. What the secret is to getting more impressions and visibility no one knows.",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-20 18:56:26.452418

I am a bit confused by how you handle this issue. As you can imagine, displaying gig statistics is quite an important functionality for any fiverr seller on your platform. You even promote it as one of the basic functionalities of fiverr in your eLearning videos. And this is sure true as interpreting and reacting to gigs analytics data may have direct impact on the received orders.
Mistakes can happen and problems pop up every now and then in any company but I am left rather speechless how you handle this incident.
First, there is no transparent communication on this issue beside this orange box, which is telling the obvious, i.e. that the gigs statistics are not displayed and that you are working on it. But common, you have a blog, why not use it to communicate with your customers? Why are the gigs stats down? Have you been hacked? Did someone press delete accidentally? Did a server go down? How is the progress of fixing the issue so far? Anything?!
Instead people have to search through the forums for a thread, which is not even marked sticky, but people actually have to search for it. On top, the thread basically says the same as the orange box and is flooded by repeating questions of your customers. This is a pretty bad communication Fiverr team.
Moreover, asking in the forums, I was merely pointed to this thread, which doesn’t provide any information at all, instead of answering my questions, which are rather legit to most of us. On top, without having a chance to reply my thread was closed? Pretty strange way of addressing legit requests of your customers.
I hope you can use this current challenge to heavily improve the way you communicate incidents with your customers.
Happy to receive your feedback.
Cheers,
André",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:46 am",2020-08-20 18:56:26.832827

thanks! Actually, it is not about sharing secrets at all. it is about communication. Incident response and incident response communication are standard processes of any company. It is not a binary decision to either publicly disclose non-secret data or not disclose anything because internal processes might be affected. In both cases, transparent communication is key.
I am not saying that the public should decide how the side is run. It is really just about communicating issues that affect the platform as a whole to its customers. I think this is a basic process for any company like mentioned above.

I’m taking a stab in the dark here that the two things (metrics not showing AND search visibility down) are actually two separate incidents.
I rarely use the metrics side of things as I personally feel that I can’t change it based on those graphs and in most cases never corrolate with the oprders that I’m getting based on impressions etc.
In terms of the search visibility I think that they’ve probably made their search algorithm a little too harsh on some ranking factors hence why peoples searches are down. Although this isn’t Google (which has over 200 separate ranking factors) it still is a search engine and needs to be twaked periodically.
Judging by the influx of questions regarding this I feel it needs to be tweaked again.
As for my gigs visibility? It seems that my orders are fluctuating between getting a big fat 0 per day to up to 10 per day.

It does not matter what is truth. The truth is what people think is truth.
The facts are:
Fiverr planned IT maintenance for certain date and time. As far as I know and some people confirmed in forum the maintenance has not happened yet. Fiverr did not communicate any further about it. Not good.
Fiverr announced N/A in analytics long time ago and confirmed they are going to fix it. A lot of people who are also not genius like me suppose that it should have been already fixed. Fiverr does not communicate any progress, anything about it. Not good.

I’m in complete agreeance with you. As a Level 2 Seller with 200+ reviews on this specific gig alone, it doesn’t seem logical (or fair but we won’t go into that) that “randomly” my Best Selling gig would lose it’s search authority to instead preference gigs with limited credibility.
I read one post that possibly they’ve skewed the algorithm to favor new Sellers amidst the COVID-19 crisis? While in a way I understand the logic, I too spent nearly a year putting my blood, sweat and tears into creating something sustainable out of this gig - proving my capabilities, commitment to customer service, etc.
If this is an intentional shift in the algorithm, it is disappointing that Fiverr would do wrong by loyal Sellers, who too are struggling through this humanitarian and economic crisis. May I ask if this is an issue you might recommend inquiring further with customer service about? I’ve tried politely, but receive a blanket response re: display issue.

. I don’t know How they became Top Rated Seller If they Don’t Understand a Basic Thing.
@vidvox The thing about this forum is that it’s normal for people to have different opinions. That does NOT mean you get to insult them or talk badly about them if you don’t agree with them.
I don’t need to come here and try to explain things to people. I don’t get paid for this. I do it because of the misguided idea that people like you might learn something. What do I get out of this discussion? Nothing at all.
Someone might say to themselves, she has been here over 7 years, does pretty good here. So maybe she is trying to tell us something we don’t know.
But instead of that all anyone keeps saying is
WAA WAA WAAAAAH my gigs arent’ showing, I’m not getting orders, it’s from the statistics not showing when will it be fixed WAAAHHHH!
I’m finally convinced that some can’t learn, can’t understand, can’t see or take in any new things that someone says to them. It’s not possible.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:46 am",2020-08-20 18:56:45.241854

Everyone complaining is new to fiverr or they found their old account and logged in. I give more value to words of one top rated seller than hundreds of new sellers related to this topic.
I would also really like to see my stats but even without them I can say that I have a satisfactory number of orders and I’m here for 20-25 days. I only saw my stats once before it got broken and they were really discouraging but they didn’t mean a lot.
So listen to seniors and try to understand what are they saying, they rarely say something straight to the point but let you think about it and find solution for your problem with their guidance. I agree some of them do write in quite a negative and sometimes irritating way but they still write to help you.

there is big mess going i dont know why you people dont accept that…

They Don’t understand a Basic thing that If Fiverr has a Option and its not working then surely there is a problem.
They understand that there’s a problem. Nobody is denying that there’s a problem with display.
However, just because some sellers are not getting messages/orders since that problem started, doesn’t mean that not getting orders is related to the display error. If it was related to display error, nobody would receive orders; but if you read some other topics, you will see that many sellers (a lot more than 2-3) are getting orders, and even earning well.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 12:36 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:49.577359

Honestly, I rarely change it, and I know that causes me to drop back in rankings. When I do though, it’s important for me to see how that affects changes in the long run as, like I said, my gig is niche. I understood that going in. The only thing I can use to evaluate the interest (note that I’m not saying success) is in analytics, as my sales aren’t frequent enough to give good data.
I wonder if this whole argument is just the difference in perspectives. For those who have a steady stream of sales, the analytics page is essentially useless. You know sales are going to come in and your gig is running like a well-oiled machine; what’s the point of checking impressions, then?
For those who don’t expect many sales (like me), the analytics data actually serve a role as they’re an important indicator of interest. I only get a few sales a month, which I’m fine with, so I need to rely on other indicators for gig performance. They’re not perfect, but it generally helps me predict if a sale is coming or if my ads on other sites are actually driving traffic to my gig.
Of course, there are plenty of new recruits who are using analytics as a source of hope, and that’s where a lot of problems come up, as they’re not entirely reliable and don’t guarantee anything.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:01 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:54.256835

My theory is that if your gigs can have a way to stand out somehow from the rest in a good way then you won’t need the analytics, for those who are in a highly competitive group of sellers. That way might simply be having outstanding talent.
If a seller has been plodding along with bad graphics and a gig that doesn’t stand out somehow from the rest and getting impressions and sales they’ve been very lucky.

I haven’t gotten any orders in the past 2 weeks and it would be incredibly useful to see if there was a drop in impressions or the same amount of impressions, just nobody is inquiring (which I could use to adjust my gig accordingly.)
I would hazard a guess that your impressions have gone way down if you stopped getting orders, if you regularly got orders before.
I can tell where my gig is located approximately and how many impressions it gets by how many messages and orders I get.
Impressions are not the whole story since you can get a lot of very low quality impressions, where your gig is actually being displayed, but not in a place anyone is looking for it to buy it.
It’s always possible that you can have lots of impressions without any sales if your gig is shown only to a certain demographic, certain country, certain out of the way place, where it is assured it won’t get sales.
We all would like our gigs to be shown mostly in one or two countries known to represent the most buyers but it’s possible to have it displayed where no one ever wants it also. Fiverr is good at showing impressions where it’s not going to get many sales sometimes as part of it’s rotation.
Fiverr can also slow down sales for you in spite of a lot of impressions by putting the gigs of your competition right on your own gig page.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 9:04 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:56.520277

Impressions are not the whole story since you can get a lot of very low quality impressions, where your gig is actually being displayed, but not in a place anyone is looking for it to buy it.
It’s always possible that you can have lots of impressions without any sales if your gig is shown only to a certain demographic, certain country, certain out of the way place, where it is assured it won’t get sales.
Of course, I get what you’re saying. I think I meant to say it would be helpful to see all the analytics, such as clicks combined with impressions, so that I could tell people if were clicking but being turned away by my gig description or something. I don’t see why they would, it’s worked fantastic in the past… but who knows. (EDIT: Just read your edit, I see how it could also be the competition showing up)
misscrystal:
We all would like our gigs to be shown mostly in one or two countries known to represent the most buyers but it’s possible to have it displayed where no one ever wants it also. Fiverr is good at showing impressions where it’s not going to get many sales sometimes as part of it’s rotation.
Thank you for saying that, that makes a lot of sense.
I also read something about “the curse of the Level 1 seller” where apparently once people reach Level 1 their orders slow dramatically or just flat out stop. Not sure how accurate that is hahah, nor if it would affect me (I qualify for Level 1 but am waiting on the evaluation.) I think everything just came together at the very wrong time, with my almost-leveling up, plus the bug, plus all the new sellers, plus the rotation, plus me having been out of office recently… really killed my momentum hahah. But, listening to what you’ve said has given me hope for the future so thanks a ton for talking with me
misscrystal:
Fiverr can also slow down sales for you in spite of a lot of impressions by putting the gigs of your competition right on your own gig page.
Well isn’t that just kind of them.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 9:51 pm",2020-08-20 18:56:56.902334

Because you are doing well thats why you dont need to check your gig stats
I never checked my gig stats them when I was a newbie, either.
I figured there were more important things to be done like fine-tuning my gig, creating new gigs, and reading everything I could on the Forum about how to do so.
I also listened to the advice of the Forum member who had much knowledge to share. I honestly have not missed seeing my gig stats.
Besides as Fiverr says, No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual. And I find that to be true because I continue to get orders from new buyers and my regulars alike.
Maybe those who see a dip in their orders and such should think about how to improve their profile and gigs rather than blaming the inability to see their gig metrics.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:36 am",2020-08-20 18:57:04.552391

most of the sellers complaining about the display error, are also the same sellers that aren’t taking any productive ACTIONS to become successful.
Looks like you have checked out all those sellers to arrive at this conclusion.
It’s crazy how someone who is not a fiverr staff nor a fiverr web developer or site engineer seems to know how fiverr works. Since 2014 when I signed up, there has always been gig stats. Fiverr can say things to save face or calm people, but don’t try to make others look stupid.
Everyone has a right to say what they are experiencing. Just don’t tell them nothing is wrong or they shouldn’t talk about it or that what they say doesn’t matter. It doesn’t make sense. You might think you are trying to make sense, but you are not.
Stop acting like you are being paid to say these things. You know nothing if you are not a fiverr employee. Your experience or how long you have been here doesn’t matter in this type of issue. Take a break!",N/A,"May 27, 2020 4:55 pm",2020-08-20 18:57:07.743590

With these replies, I could swear that there are 2-3 people getting paid to calm people down because of the panic this bug is creating.
As I said earlier, the gigs stopped rotating and you might be lucky to be on the first or second page when it stopped. However, there are people stuck on the last page.
I receive atleast two messages on Fiverr everyday and ever since this bug started, I have received 0. 0. I have like 5 friends on Fiverr that the same has happened to. Either their gigs disappeared to the last page or they can’t even find their gigs anymore. On the other hand , you will find gigs with 1 star reviews , 2 star reviews on the first page. And these gigs have been on the first page for weeks now. That would never happen if everything was normal.
Yes you’re lucky, your gigs are working fine because the platform collapsed when you were on the first page or so, but you can’t use your own privileges to downplay what everyone else is going through. That makes no sense at all.
As it has been said repeatedly here, if it was a just a display issue, Fiverr would have solved it in a day. IT IS WAY MORE THAN THAT. The N/A bug has messed up the algorithm but Fiverr won’t tell us that because that will make them lose people.
Waking up to see replies dismissing everyone’s claims as “illogical” or just replying with “Fiverr has already said it doesn’t affect so it doesn’t ” make me sick.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 5:22 pm",2020-08-20 18:57:08.986924

We are also speaking of online traffic, I think it is more than fair to say that it should be much higher since most people are in their homes throughout the pandemic.
Many countries have also opened tattoo shops, my country included. Which would suggest more online traffic.
Lastly, there are multiple people with the same problem. They are not all in the Tattoo Design category.

Fiverr is not set up for sellers to “decline messages” that they don’t want to respond to. In fact, quite the opposite – sellers have 24 hours to respond to any messages that they receive, before not responding starts to penalize their response stat.

Great article, sadly it doesn’t answer the question. It is the first time that in 5 years I see that something is not working. At least in my case I don’t see the Gig views. There is no way of knowing whether or not that change in the algorithm is beneficial. Even changing and editing the Gigs, nobody is going to check if their Gigs are really being shown.
Generally that is what I do, when I see that nobody writes me I take actions, I create new Gigs, I try to lower prices, make offers. But this time how can you know?
I think it takes more than just a great 5 page post.
They need to solve the problem or maybe they have to tell us that things are like this now.!
Just as the “clearance times” at all levels changed one day, just as they placed a very complex penalty system based on various variables, perhaps now the idea is that we must be blind and trust as the red notice says ""We are doing things as always only that at the moment they are not seen """,N/A,"Jun 16, 2020 10:37 pm",2020-08-20 18:59:01.604888

I know you think you are flying blind without your analytics, but if we are being honest the gig analytics were not tellings us that much.
If you are an experienced seller you can tell when things are going well or if there’s something up.
There is definitely something up, but we don’t know what and Fiverr will not tell us.

I get 2* on Jun 2. My first negative review. (I have an old 1* but tend not to count it because it’s for that order auto-completing). It’s a funny story for another time. The order is Fiverr’s Choice.
On Jun 3 I receive 2 orders back to back from new people of my other gig that no one ever buys. It’s very interesting because I haven’t gotten multiple orders from new people on the same day ever since Covid happened.
I complete those, get 5* for both. My main gig is dead.
On Jun 4 the buyer who left me a negative review comes to my inbox and tries to force me to remove the response I’ve left to their review. I report the threat and contact CS. CS tells me there is no case, he had a right to leave a review, I had a right to respond.
On Jun 5 I get another Fiverr’s Choice order on my main gig, finish that one with 5*. The person buys another 3 designs as a custom package. This new custom offer is also marked as Fiverr’s choice. I complete it with 5*.
It’s been a deluge ever since. I got to my entire May earnings around June 12th.
I should mention that my regulars start coming back in June and they mostly order bigger custom packages. Well, bigger for me. My basic price is $50. They mostly buy $150-200 custom offers.
I also get a few new returning customers. We start with a basic package, they later come back to get another 3-4. If that has anything to do with, well, anything.
My delivery time was 3 days during quarantine, I had to switch it back to 4 days in June. Doesn’t seem to affect anything. I usually deliver 12-24 hours before the deadline.
May was terrible. I hit my “comfortable minimum” but barely. Had a few unpleasant interactions with buyers. I worked for that “comfortable minimum” hard.
No cancellations since Apr 1. Then I had the same custom offer canceled twice because the buyer couldn’t sort out their payment method. It led to $700 of canceled funds (my absolute record) handing over my head till Jun 1. CS assured me it wouldn’t affect anything but who knows.",N/A,"Jun 17, 2020 5:12 am",2020-08-20 18:59:08.270409

My feeling is that Fiverr’s approach was to attempt to just slip the extra layer (paid ads) into the existing algorithm … resulting in the whole thing falling apart.
I think they have always hand selected the top two rows at least, or been able to insert a few into those rows by hand instead of by algorithm.
I don’t think it fell apart. I think they may have altered it or changed what parameters it favors among gigs.
I think it was set to artificially boost some gigs and hold down other gigs that could have actually done better if things were left to rank gigs organically, so sellers could get orders even if they were less deserving for various reasons.
I think they took that set of parameters off in the last two months.

It is very important to look at the views, because generally when I was already finishing the work with the active orders I typically saw that Fiverr increased the impressions of my most successful Gigs.
When the up arrows indicated that views were increasing, customers would start writing to you. (this has been going on for 5 years).
Am i paranoid I like conspiracy theories?
It’s possible…
Maybe the problem is that I spend 15 years of my life developing applications for the cloud computing. (I’m system engineer)
One of the basic things according to ITIL best practices is the attention to breakdowns.
When a change is made in an active platform with millions of users there is always a plan to return in case it fails, there are data backups, there is always a contingency plan.
It is impossible that something as expensive as Fiverr has 1 month down.
Sorry but beleive , What happens here is NOT a bug.
Something they are trying, it is probably the promotions (but I do not know).
They may have decided that people who don’t pay won’t get any promotions. Maybe they stop charging us 20% and return our money in less time. Maybe things changed. Maybe they are testing our reaction.
It is also possible that they have decided to change the entire model and they do not care what we think.
In a pandemic, confined, many people looking for money and supplies in many countries and Fiverr “fallen”?
They have to explain something to us …",N/A,"Jun 17, 2020 8:40 am",2020-08-20 18:59:18.465738

Fiverr is a platform, but without our talent have no difference with any directory on the Internet.
Do people trust Fiverr?
Sure!!!
They trust that Fiverr has guarantee mechanisms. Talented workers! real reviews!

But they get 20% of each sale!! Fiverr is your parther!!
In FB case you can promote something thats true! But you don’t have to pay FB subscription. FB is free…
The best example is Netflix vs. Youtube. You pay one fee on Netflix, right? ok, so you don’t see Ads. Because you spend money!!!
Youtube is free!!! So, it’s logical to see some ads or pay the premium account to eliminate.
Here is a Mess. You get just 80% of your money 14 days later, of course , this is beacuse Fiverr need 20% of your money to promote your services!!!
One question. Anyone with any merit can come and promote services??? Just need money?

Please can you explain me a bit about fiverr’s choice, I mean are sellers selected for it or gigs? and when someone places an order, does fiverr see that this order is a bit interesting and mark the order as fiverr’s choice before you delivering it or it works the other way?
Hi, I know didn’t ask me, but I think no one answered. Fiverr’s Choice is given to the gig, not the seller. Some people believe it’s manually chosen, but I think it’s the algorithm and it has to do with maintaining 5 stars and probably has a lot to do with the secret reviews as well.
I’ve been Fiverr’s Choice almost continuously since March but only a few of my orders say they are “Fiverr’s Choice orders”. I think it’s because the badge doesn’t show with every keyword, so the ones that say they are, it just means that particular buyer chose me after seeing the badge.

I have always believed that all those variables that we must comply with are beneficial.
I live in a Latin American country that has a dictatorship, hyperinflation, electrical problems and insecurity.
On one occasion there was a 100 hour blackout, some clients here at Fiverr understood the situation, others did not!
Fulfill on time, have the best quality, low prices that is Fiverr.
For this reason, it is vital that Fiverr resolve the situation and define it.
We must always comply! The customer is generally right!
All this is perfect because we generate a quality platform.

The 20% doesn’t bother me, I would gladly pay 30%, even 50%, if I could make $19,000 like I did in 2015. If Fiverr wanted me to raise prices, rewarded me for doing so, if they told me what gigs to create, delete, etc. If they gave me gig images. Then I would have a partner.
This is the point! I agree 100% with you.
If we are going to make money like in 2015 or more, let’s go now!
The problem is that most of them are not receiving messages, clicks, orders.
Most of us are seeing the Fiverr blackout.
If the new scheme makes us earn money and we must maintain quality, I AGREE!
The fact is that everything is turned off.
Oh , Sorry.
You do have 7 orders waiting and you raised the prices and everything works only for you! Congratulations!
But, since it is a Platform with millions of users, it is very dangerous to remove sellers from the ecosystem. Because the quality falls and on the Internet the availability time is everything!
Many buyers do not now get most of the sellers we have been working for 5 or more years here!
That is a reality!

I have been searching Fiverr as a buyer user. If I can see Gigs when I search, I even see level2, level1 and Top. The truth is that I am NOT in that search (I used to do it was always there).
As nobody knows how to answer what happens, I think this is a change in policy. There are people working! But it is not us!
Is that possible?
A user here on this forum said yesterday that he did have orders! If you are looking for vendors, we may not be the same as always. Maybe Fiverr decided to change things.
The other option I see is that there is something we must change in the GIGs. New Tags? prices? Names? something?",N/A,"Jun 20, 2020 11:53 am",2020-08-20 18:59:42.141773

Sure!
I have been researching other platforms and Fiverr is the only one with that business model. In Fiverr anyone could enter, in the others it is not so easy, even most of them have to pay. Some even investigate and protect their sellers with messages like “I’m sorry but I have many sellers just like you.”
So I think it is possible that Fiverr is changing the business model. They must be trying something and we will soon see that everything is different. I don’t think a one month failure is the cause. There is something else …
In this forum there are other topics and I read that there are people receiving orders even reporting topics of the evaluations and rates so as not to miss the levels…
The question is: Why do they see clients and we don’t?",N/A,"Jun 21, 2020 2:17 pm",2020-08-20 18:59:51.879113

First of all, this is NOT Fiverr’s job.
Fiverr is nothing but a marketplace, and the amount of work you get is by far most influenced by supply and demand. If you do a good job, and your clients are happy, you move up in the world and get more orders. There are different other factors, for example, if you are doing this full time or just as a side thing, also it is important to be online, as many customers want a fast/instant reply, etc.
The gig stat “issue” has no relevance, it is just metrics that they show you.
Personally I am getting the same number of daily requests I have always had.
I see that you are musician, as such I am sure you are very well aware of the impact COVID19 has had on the music industry, it is simply not something essential for most companies, and if no money is coming in it will quickly go very far down on the companies list of priorities.
I am sure things will start looking up for you soon.
I wish you good luck and all the best!",N/A,"Jun 23, 2020 7:59 am",2020-08-20 19:00:07.273198

First of all, this is NOT Fiverr’s job.
Hi Patrick, Thanks for write! COngratulations you are the second person who have no problem at all here, of course I know this post is too long now. So , it’s difficult to read…
Patrick lot off sellers on Fiverr have been experiencing a blackout.
During the entire pandemic I was full of work here. Suddenly everything stopped. No messages, no orders and I left the search lists.
The first thing I thought was that it was my problem! Quickly searching the forum I understood that it was not just me, there were other sellers with the problem.
What happens to the vast majority?
Having the best possible level, fulfilling everything on time and with 5-star evaluations took us out of the game.
Patrick, there are people here who have written indicating that they are Top Rated, they received 50 orders on average and today they have nothing.
Friend something is wrong with Fiverr.
It is evident that if I am 5 years old in this I already understood what I must do to go up in the lists, but the case of the Top Rated who have large incomes is even clearer that this sudden blackout is not normal.
Fiverr is making changes to its platform to introduce a new scheme with paid ads. Many say the forum that they have decided to “move” things especially with classic vendors that have Gigs for years producing…
This new method with ads is already in the testing stage for very few users. That’s not the problem!! The problem is that most of us were removed from the search lists.
patrickcharlie:
Fiverr is nothing but a marketplace, and the amount of work you get is by far most influenced by supply and demand.
In this you are right! Let me explain now how that “supply - demand” works on Fiverr.
A buyer searches Fiverr for a service.
Fiverr shows him a list of sellers. That has been changing over the years. Now Fiverr Pro users appear at the top (which makes total sense) and then users with rankings appear and the list turns pages to leave those less relevant at the end.
Fiverr exposes your Gig to its community, for this reason it takes away 20% of your income and also retains your money for 14 days.
That is Fiverr’s job. and they must show you that they are exposing you in exchange for that 20%, that you will receive if you have done things well and on time.
Of course it is supply and demand, but Fiverr by exposing you is telling buyers “Look at the work of this seller” “It is reliable” “It is fast” “Hundreds of users have made positive reviews”
The relation “Supply - demand” is not magic, Fiverr shows the work and the buyers choose.
That has now lost its meaning! Just read yourself to great sellers here who are experiencing the same so that you understand what you may face …
Thank you for your words and I hope that everything continues well.
Fiverr is a platform and we are understanding as a community what happens here? As soon as we understand it, maybe we can adapt or maybe not!

Also a message to all people who are facing issues, how is your industry doing outside of fiverr? That is something you should keep track of, COVID did not impact all industries the same and not all of them at the same time, some industries are yet to feel the aftermath of COVID, some were hit in the beginning and so on.
So make sure, that you on your side have done absolutely EVERYTHING you can before jumping to conclusions.
I noticed many sellers have some idea about what is important in their industry, but they simply do not know how business in general works - and that is perfectly fine, just find someone to help you out, to coach you, train you or simply consult you.

Hi there! Friend, when you have a cancellation on Fiverr it is very likely that you will be penalized. That has only happened to me a few times, problems have happened to me with some clients and the result is always that this index falls below 90% and you lose the level in the evaluation.
There is something terrible in Fiverr! cancellation of orders!",N/A,"Jun 24, 2020 1:08 pm",2020-08-20 19:00:13.358155

YOU need to value your work
Great Patrick.!
The main idea here is win - win. I agree 100% with you!
If your service is good, it must have a cost, of course it is a market, but that price war on services is pointless.
Doing a service for 5USD so that you have 4USD that is also subject to approval and they give you 14 days later it does not make sense.
Another problem is if Fiverr offers people such low-cost services, are they really quality?
In my case it became impossible to lower prices further.",N/A,"Jun 24, 2020 1:17 pm",2020-08-20 19:00:13.725263

reduce my prices
Sarika is good to ask yourself this question. Can you keep those ridiculously low prices going forward? If you offer the customer something for 50 and end up doing it for 10, don’t you think he thought you wanted to steal it?
I have years at Fiverr and the truth is that the best jobs and the best experiences are when the client values your effort and you receive what is fair for your work.
Once I accepted a great job because there were many services ( they were many). In the end I couldn’t finish that job well, since the same person who asked to lower prices, as soon as we started began to behave as if he had paid the higher price. I’m talking about something worth maybe 100 leaving it at 30. It was a terrible experience and when I delivered the disputes began. They asked me for changes that were out of budget. They also asked for things that had settled in again.
I understood that it would never end, and the cancellation led me to lose the level and drop a lot in sales also at that time.
It is better to charge fair because you can spend more than you receive. That makes no sense!",N/A,"Jun 24, 2020 1:25 pm",2020-08-20 19:00:14.095397

yeah we hope so fiverr will understand what problems we are facing
Friend believe me! After months with this problem I think it is a change. It is not a Bug!
They usually solve a bug in hours.
This is a new way of working with Fiverr, some of us are left out and others continue to sell.
In this post there are dozens of people with the same problem as us, but a couple of people say they continue to sell …
If you look in that search list of Fiverr there are people selling right now, we after 5 years and all the merit are no longer there.
They wanted us out?
Will they let us return?
Will this become **********? (I mean you can apply for work offers but you pay to be first on the list, you pay for the courses)

I don’t think they talk about problems on the platform. But I think they will explain where Fiverr is going.
When we all understand this new path, we will likely find a way to participate.

Hi there!
Thanks for writing here!
Here you have my profile
https://www.fiverr.com/carlosrada?up_rollout=true 3
I’ve been on Fiverr by 5 years, as you can see all my Gig appear to be “active”. Saddly many sellers have the same problem, I think you have it now!
Nobody nows exactly the reason of this wear shift. Some seller have this problem like 2-3 months.
At first we thought it was a BUG because the views are not seen but I think this is the new Fiverr normal.
Other sellers have said in this long post that it is the new “paid advertising” scheme. We understand that a few sellers are testing it and that it will be operational soon.
It is evident that advertising will change the position of the sellers in the search lists, and it is possible that this current situation is the first step towards it.
I sincerely believe that the Fiverr business model will change, this is the only platform that operates in this way. They already included the famous “paid certification courses” and only “paid advertising” was missing for Fiverr to become something very similar to its well-known competition …
I think that those of us who have been working here for years must adapt, some sellers suggest having several different work options on other platforms or increasing the presence of your personal brand to make your customer portfolio.
I will always thank Fiverr for giving me the opportunity to make music for more than 25 countries on 5 continents.
We will be back? I do not know…
Do Fiverr want us back? I do not know too…
Do we have to change to continue? That is for sure, we are all doing it with the pandemic …",N/A,"Jul 4, 2020 5:40 pm",2020-08-20 19:00:27.278558

The current system may be legacy but things outgrow legacy all the time. We haven’t used horses as transport for so long that Hitching Posts are no longer a thing that anyone could reasonably expect.
Right now the Seller is at a massive disadvantage, esp with more complex projects. With a “For $5 I will send you a plastic spoon” kind of job one would assume that said plastic spoon was in-stock.
Scoring for a film or Mixing a song is far less simple and even assuming everything is sent over properly (which sadly is 95% never), it may just not be a good fit and you are forced to do a job that you know you can’t excel at or lose - cancellation causes a loss even if it is the right thing to do for everyone concerned.

As I enjoy the new award as a Level one seller, I get to experience for the first time the unpleasantry of a late delivery.
I agreed with a buyer the delivery of a project by the 4th of September and stated this also in the “box” of the custom order.
Unfortunately, when the buyer accepted the offer, the delivery was strangely set to 24 hours.
I immediately asked to extend the delivery to the previously agreed time due to this “bug” in the system, but the buyer went straight offline and he didn’t log in since to read my couple of messages.
I also contacted CS the same day to ask them to have a look and extend the order should the buyer be unable to login for some reason, but still, the time is passing and I’m currently late by 12 hours and waiting for anyone to let me know
Did you experience something similar? It’s not the first time that happens when I send a custom order Was your rating affected in the meantime?

As for statistics, yes this will affect them. Also: If it stands ‘late’ for too long (two days, I think), it will cancel without your input and cause an automatic-one-star.
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/cancellations
Delivery
… When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. … Fiverr encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it’s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.
(For anyone who comes into this chat with preconceived assumptions, or happens to be looking for information on custom orders: there is a place to mark how many days the project will last, in this case it would have been 21. Setting a calendar date isn’t an option, due to a global market and time-zones.)",N/A,"Aug 15, 2020 9:12 pm",2020-08-20 19:01:34.462224

I figured out that most functions are accessible when you login from the fiverr app on your smartphone (for example, if you have running gig’s). So at least you can communicate with the seller and tell him what’s going on. However, downloading submitted files from review are corrupted. So I had to accept the project of the seller and kindly asked her to send me the files over private email.
So Fiverr replied:

https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc 5
https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9 3
Fiverr seems to have a strict communication policy about contacting each other outside their platform / requesting personal information such as Social Security Number, address, real names, ect (All stuff that is required on the W-9)…
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/communication 3
Requesting a W-9 seems like it is against Fiverr polcies… I am curious… I have spent over $600 with sellers on this platform in less than a year… and plan to continue doing this in the future (Seems a lot more probable now too, with things like Gig Extras / Fiverr Pro). How does that work, is this an issue that Fiverr has yet to address?
I will be reporting these as business expenses with the I.R.S. and without proper documentation it is possible to get audited / severely penalized by the I.R.S.
I don’t think Fiverr sends 1099’s. / This may be an issue they need to fix.
What makes it even more confusing is I am technically paying Fiverr, and then Fiverr is paying the buyer. My PayPal / Credit Card statements show Fiverr being the one I paid… not that person directly.
Please Fiverr staff respond.

Am I Required by Law to Obtain Form W-9 From My Vendors? 3
A business is required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN) from any vendor to whom it makes payments that require the issuance of a Form 1099-MISC. A Form W-9 facilitates this.

It’s better to direct this question to the customer support staff - which would be able to provide you with a far better answer to this question than any of the community here.
You are right, Fiverr is strict about things like this. It’s better to clear it out first with their staff before doing anything.",N/A,"Mar 3, 2019 6:47 pm",2020-08-20 19:02:45.730226

Requesting a W-9 seems like it is against Fiverr polcies… I am curious… I have spent over $600 with sellers on this platform in less than a year… and plan to continue doing this in the future (Seems a lot more probable now too, with things like Gig Extras / Fiverr Pro). How does that work, is this an issue that Fiverr has yet to address?
I will be reporting these as business expenses with the I.R.S. and without proper documentation it is possible to get audited / severely penalized by the I.R.S.
I don’t think Fiverr sends 1099’s. / This may be an issue they need to fix.
What makes it even more confusing is I am technically paying Fiverr, and then Fiverr is paying the buyer. My PayPal / Credit Card statements show Fiverr being the one I paid… not that person directly.
Please Fiverr staff respond.
