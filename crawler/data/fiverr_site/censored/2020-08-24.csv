As I enjoy the new award as a Level one seller, I get to experience for the first time the unpleasantry of a late delivery.
I agreed with a buyer the delivery of a project by the 4th of September and stated this also in the “box” of the custom order.
Unfortunately, when the buyer accepted the offer, the delivery was strangely set to 24 hours.
I immediately asked to extend the delivery to the previously agreed time due to this “bug” in the system, but the buyer went straight offline and he didn’t log in since to read my couple of messages.
I also contacted CS the same day to ask them to have a look and extend the order should the buyer be unable to login for some reason, but still, the time is passing and I’m currently late by 12 hours and waiting for anyone to let me know
Did you experience something similar? It’s not the first time that happens when I send a custom order Was your rating affected in the meantime?

As for statistics, yes this will affect them. Also: If it stands ‘late’ for too long (two days, I think), it will cancel without your input and cause an automatic-one-star.
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/cancellations
Delivery
… When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. … Fiverr encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it’s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.
(For anyone who comes into this chat with preconceived assumptions, or happens to be looking for information on custom orders: there is a place to mark how many days the project will last, in this case it would have been 21. Setting a calendar date isn’t an option, due to a global market and time-zones.)",,"Aug 15, 2020 9:12 pm",2020-08-20 19:01:34.462224

Sorry I have someone for this project already, maybe we can work on another project in the future. I will keep you in mind. Thank you for replying
And I thought, this must be someone falsely sent message to me and nothing important to reply about.
However, I still replied it anyway, the first day I woke up in the morning. I said:
No worries. Thank you
Like I said, I saw and replied this message through a Fiverr app on my smartphone.
Sadly, earlier today I just found out that the person did offer me a project. Just before he said sorry I have someone . . . .
He sent me a message, said:
*1. Send me your sample work *
Read the “Instructions” Doc in this file first and let me know if you can do this and if you have any questions before we continue. https://drive.google 1…*
Send me your offer.*
What a missed opportunity for me, one message is really valuable for me, I tried to answer it as fast I can. And today I found out that I missed it, because the message didn’t show up in my phone.

However, it got stuck on the onboarding screen where I need to provide information about my business.
After providing my information I can not click on “Next”. Also, at the top of the page is a green box saying “undefined”.
This is horrible because I have a running gig and its deadline is today. I can not access the delivered work and I can not access any other sites because I am being redirected to this onboarding screen.
I would be thankful if someone can help me out here.

I figured out that most functions are accessible when you login from the fiverr app on your smartphone (for example, if you have running gig’s). So at least you can communicate with the seller and tell him what’s going on. However, downloading submitted files from review are corrupted. So I had to accept the project of the seller and kindly asked her to send me the files over private email.
So Fiverr replied:
“We are aware of the issue and are doing our best to resolve it as soon as possible. You will get notified as soon as it is resolved. …”
It’s been 3 days now and that’s so bad.
I have some credits on my account that I want to use.
I hope they will solve this soon.",,"Aug 15, 2020 5:15 pm",2020-08-20 19:01:45.594064
