I’m new to Fiverr but to me it just seems really concerning that a bug like this has been around this long without a fix. Makes me wonder if this platform is going to be reliable to do business on.
EDIT: Customer support contacted me back about this. The issue was because I didn’t have a phone number listed on my account and my account needed to be verified with the phone number. Anyone else having this issue, try going to your settings and verifying your phone number and see if the issue persists. It worked for me.

My suggestion is adding in terms of service that deep fake voice construction (reusing someone’s voice) without their consent is not permitted.
It is one thing to record your voice, be paid for a recording and waive your rights to that recording.
It is another to record, be paid for that and for your voice to be reused for different narration and context without your knowledge or consent ad infinitum without compensation.
A reseller on this site has, among the voice samples available, voice samples that are artificial/slightly robotic sounding. One of the offered services for that reseller was text to voice.
If the buyer request clearly indicates that the seller’s voice can be reused for a different script in the future without additional payment or consent, fine.
But I think it should be in the terms of service that doing so without consent is disallowed.
Also, if a seller offers a text-to-voice gig, the original narrator’s consent to this should be verifiable.
I’m not saying it would be an easy task for Fiverr to investigate this!",,,,alyonagrapie,3.0,Are you sure they are using a specific person’s voice without their permission though? Text to speech software that allows commercial use does exist. One example would be google.

It is one thing to record your voice, be paid for a recording and waive your rights to that recording.
It is another to record, be paid for that and for your voice to be reused for different narration and context without your knowledge or consent ad infinitum without compensation.
A reseller on this site has, among the voice samples available, voice samples that are artificial/slightly robotic sounding. One of the offered services for that reseller was text to voice.
If the buyer request clearly indicates that the seller’s voice can be reused for a different script in the future without additional payment or consent, fine.
But I think it should be in the terms of service that doing so without consent is disallowed.
Also, if a seller offers a text-to-voice gig, the original narrator’s consent to this should be verifiable.

I don’t think it mentions audio and I’m not sure that would be necessarily be called deep fake for audio only. So I don’t think currently it’s against the TOS/site rules to use someone’s audio that they bought for another video/videos if they bought the necessary rights (eg. commercial rights).
See:
https://www.fiverr.com/community/standards/integrity-authenticity
Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence technology that superimposes the movements and words of one person onto another. While there are many legitimate applications of this technology, including mainstream filmmaking, deepfakes can also make it harder to combat the spread of disinformation and potentially easier to dismiss real events as fake. We monitor deepfake activity closely and will review reported cases on an individual basis.
Also say someone got the right audio from seller x and could use that for new voice overs, I don’t think they’d be pretending to be seller x (they probably don’t even say who it is) - so it’s not exactly faking seller x I think.",,"Jun 15, 2020 12:54 pm",2020-08-24 10:13:17.926321
