I would not recommend doing that as it’s against fiverr tos and your account will be restricted right away.

Regular",7,"I am a frequent buyer on Fiverr, and when I place orders, I usually need to do at least a dozen at a time. Oftentimes within the same category. I am sure a lot of other buyers do the same. Why would Fiverr restrict buyers in this way? It would make their revenues drop immensely and also make the process more inconvenient for buyers. It would make many buyers switch to competitors.
And, I am sure my account would have been flagged last Summer then. I ordered from a lot of sellers who suddenly realized that they could not do what they promised after stringing me along for weeks or even months at a time, or who delivered incomplete work.
Yes, cancellations may hurt sellers more than buyers (analytics dropping, level demotions), and it may sometimes seem very unfair, but Fiverr cannot start flagging buyer accounts for simply ordering too much or for canceling (unless they break ToS, of course). That would hurt the marketplace and be a very bad business decision.
Also, do not forget that buyers are often hurt by cancellations as well, for example, by losing valuable time and profits.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 5:29 am",2020-07-30 01:15:59.121561

They could try to detect the scammers after the scam. (if that’s what it was).
I agree they shouldn’t’ stop buyers buying multiple orders simultaneously (eg. from the same subcategory). They used to have a basket that allowed you to have multiple orders before purchasing I think.
Amazon I think will close an account if the buyer returns too much stuff (or it might be based on the value of the purchases). Fiverr might do something similar. They might check for a very high number of cancellations from a buyer or maybe they also take the prices into account+number of cancellations+cancellation reasons.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 6:21 am",2020-07-30 01:16:01.471465

I know that the current situation in the world might cause that but I can’t understand why did I stop receiving any message? In March and April combined I received around 40-50 messages and, as I said, since this problem started I haven’t got a single message.
And when I search my gig sometimes it’s on the last page and other times I can not even find it.
Spamming “thank you” in every topic about this bug won’t help anyone.
We have to make Fiverr the best place for freelancers together and pointing out to the issues is one step closer to that goal.
Please don’t unpin this topic as you did with the last one.

It is unwise to expect Fiverr to bring you all your sales, or to make you successful.

But they don’t/didn’t. Before they changed the website code to show “N/A” for everything, the most recent few days were showing 0 for everyone. So the most recent days totals were getting either stored as 0 or null or not being stored at all in the place in the db the analytics page looks (reads) to show them, and still are likely not (otherwise they’d have removed the code that shows “N/A” in every field). So I don’t really think it’s just a “display issue”. ie. the more recent figures are wrong somewhere in the database (even if they’re right/stored in some other place).
So I’d say the correct daily totals for clicks etc. can’t be stored in the database currently for the days since it went wrong (started showing 0 for everyone). But it’s possible that there’s another table/file where the values needed to create those daily totals and that that is working okay (though it’s strange that it’s not been fixed so far).",N/A,"May 17, 2020 3:14 am",2020-07-30 01:17:27.946495

I don’t see how this “fanboy” attitude helps anyone.
He has his opinion that people should do things to try to improve their gigs and situation on their own. There is some merit in that. I realize people seem to be in a panic right now.
As I said, every time someone on the forum is saying their gigs have disappeared:
they are delivering orders currently or have orders in their queue
or
They cannot find their own gigs since they don’t know how to search for them.
I haven’t tried looking at people’s gigs for everyone who complains, only about 6 sellers. I did find one who was correct that his gigs were not on the first four pages.
The rest had their gigs displayed and I found them within less than ten seconds.
So it’s easy to become jaded or untrusting of what people are reporting due to things like that.",N/A,"May 17, 2020 5:04 am",2020-07-30 01:17:32.335479

Please
@jonbaas
if you know you are not affected by this, just stop posting same thing on every topic about “Nothing wrong with algorithm” you are not part of support team or Fiverr staff…
I am affected by this – and have been many times over the past few years. This is nothing new, and it does not stop a good seller from being successful. I have learned how to work withing the system, and I have learned how to overcome the obstacles. I am trying to help other people think for themselves, and learn to overcome these obstacles as well.
Just because the loud voices, that like to complain, don’t want to listen, doesn’t make me wrong, or the facts untrue. This is nothing new. The algorithm is working, and it is normal for gigs to rotate – and yes, move to the last page from time to time. This has happened to me half a dozen times or more over the past few years, and my gigs have always rotated back over time.
Be patient, learn to adapt, and please stop complaining as if this is the end of the world. It isn’t.

As you all I am facing the same issue. My gig was on the first page and now I can’t even find it in first 10 pages. No new clients no new messages. Then I messaged fiverr team and they told me my gig is totally fine. So I was really confused by not knowing what actually happened. Then I thought I should act positively.
If fiverr says they are working on it, surely they will be doing so. We have nothing to do with that. I don’t remember they waited us this much in the past few years. They might be facing some practical issues in this pandemic. That might be the reason for taking it this longer.
So these are the things I did
I update all my gigs again. Then I found out some gigs have lack of keywords and some have unwanted and wrong keywords
And I saw that fiverr has given a new place to put your “SEO TITLE”. Some of you might know about this already. If not, please go and update your SEO TITLE today.
Then I update the FAQ for many of my gigs. I hope it might help your client to understand your service much better.
Here is the most important thing. I saw my gig description works fine on desktop but not on mobile devices. Some of my gigs didn’t have spaces between paragraphs when it comes to mobile view. But it was totally fine in desktop view. We all know now everybody uses mobile. So this will have a real effect in your gigs.
Also, I take few fiverr tests related to my service. So I could verify few of my skills
And one last thing I did was, I spent a few bucks on “Learn from fiverr” tutorials related to my service to upgrade my skills. I must say these tutorials are Amazing. Specially tutorials from Mr. Daniel Walter Scott was excellent. I invite you to watch these tutorials and you will thank me one day. Also, you will get few badges at the end as a bonus and they will be displayed on your profile forever.
So these are the things I did in this bad situation. Because I thought doing something is better than waiting. Let’s hope for the best",N/A,"May 17, 2020 3:13 pm",2020-07-30 01:17:48.677145

As the message in the orange bar clearly indicates, your gig’s ability to gain metrics, and appearance in the search results have absolutely nothing to do with the display issue on your Gigs page.
The message clearly states:
“No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.”
The display issue has nothing to do with the success or visibility of your gigs. Fiverr has literally said this, word for word. Please stop perpetuating false claims.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 1:23 am",2020-07-30 01:18:02.808021

Not lots compared to the total number of sellers on Fiverr. They’re just loud on the forum, but then again, you have a similar loud group every now and then. They blame the change in algorithm, the holidays, this change, that change… And sales come and go, no matter what, and it can happen to sellers of any level.
Many sellers are still getting sales (just look at all the topics about their first sale, their first $1000, whatever).
It’s pretty much the usual, with those who haven’t been getting sales lately now blaming the inability to see their metrics instead of blaming the algorithm, covid, Fiverr sabotaging them on purpose, or somebody’s dog.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 2:28 am",2020-07-30 01:18:03.616570

Though it depends whether a lot of that traffic is from those wanting to sell on Fiverr. It could be lots of increased competition which could make it harder on average to make sales.

but you don’t know any better than anyone else
No, I don’t. What I do know is that I’m getting more sales than I did in April (or March, February, January…). And I’m not the only one.
mattheweveringh:
i know it’s odd people say they had dozens of messages daily or weekly and now have none
I don’t know for how long you’ve been on Fiverr forum, but every now and then, there is a number of sellers (not always the same sellers, of course) who complain about the exact same thing, and it’s been like that for years, when the problem with displaying metrics didn’t exist.
mattheweveringh:
I don’t see why all of these people are “a loud group” when some are top sellers.
I call them the loud group because there’s always a loud group complaining about not getting sales, and because they keep saying the same thing, you get the impression that their number is huge, even though there are sellers who keep getting sales (but they don’t come to the forum to repeatedly say that). And level has nothing to do with it, top sellers can suddenly stop getting sales, too.
Now the ones who are not getting sales are even louder than usual, probably because of the pandemic panic.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 6:21 am",2020-07-30 01:18:07.536188

. Fiverr is a very well known company.

If this kind of problem who is very serious (affecting sellers’ sales), at least, they need to speak out. Tell the truth! The reason some people become “loud” (like someone said) because we deserve to know what’s happening.
We don’t blame Fiverr. We know fixing this kind of problem takes time. BUT, don’t be silent! It’s unprofessional.

Fiverr has told everyone what is happening. They stated it quite clearly in the orange bar on your Gigs page. They have said that there is a metrics display issue, which they are working on fixing, but that display issue has nothing to do with the active status of gigs, or any gig’s appearance in the search algorithm. You know what is happening. There is nothing else that Fiverr needs to tell you.
shimizuhiroshi1:

Not at all. Fiverr’s “silence” likely just means that they haven’t been able to fix the errors yet.

It’s working for you Great. Isn’t working for many of Us That’s it.
I experience the same things all the loud voices are complaining about right now. I am not immune just because I am a Fiverr veteran. The search algorithm affects us all equally. The difference is, I work with the system, instead of complaining when it doesn’t do what I want or make me more visible than someone else. There are thousands of people who want to be on the first page of search results, but there isn’t room for them on that page. This is why the system rotates all gigs (based upon internal factors we do not need to know about).
If you are rotated “to the last page”, be patient, and you will likely be rotated back. This has happened to me many times over the past few years. Yes, it happens to me, and no, I am not complaining about it over and over here on the forums – like the current loud voices are.
This is how the search algorithm works.
sameed_webdev:
We aren’t getting any response from Buyers .
It is a terribly irresponsible concept to expect the Fiverr search system to work in your favor, and provide you with all of your orders. If you aren’t getting the kind of orders you want from the search system, then please take responsibility for your own success, and market and promote your gigs to your target customers – on your own – wherever they may be located. All businesses have to do this. Here on Fiverr, you are a businessman too, so I don’t understand why hard self-motivated work doesn’t apply to the loud voices here, on the forums?
Fiverr says the search system is working like it should. This clarification is clearly posted on everyone’s Gigs page. As Fiverr clearly states, the analytics display error has nothing to do with gigs being active, and functioning properly, within the search system.
sameed_webdev:
Kindly Take into consideration what others are going through.
I am well aware of the nature of the complaints being voiced here. Complaints, however, do not equal truth, especially when Fiverr has clearly spelled out the nature of the error (and it’s connection to anything else). Complaining about something that Fiverr says is not broken, is not going to result in the search system being changed to adhere to the demands being voiced here.
Please be patient. The analytics DISPLAY ERROR will be fixed when Fiverr fixes it.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 4:32 pm",2020-07-30 01:18:16.949138

why are you always referring to “Fiverr say”?.. Let me tell you something, there is what we call Market Strategy, if a business or an organization is affected one way or the other, in order to protect the interest of people patronizing them, they may say nothing is wrong with the business or say everything under control, this is just to calm the people down and not letting them fret or run away.
Look at the statistics issue for over 3 weeks, Fiverr is yet to rectify it and that same time alot of sellers complaining of missing gig, I did a test above in which I told you to carry out but you seem not interested because you know something is wrong with the system.
I don’t want you always saying that phrase that “Fiverr say”, what if they are trying to protect the interest of the community and people using it thereby trying to calm everybody down and not fret, and they are not telling us what we suppose to know?.. I respect you

This is nothing. I wish people would stop making it into something it’s not.

why people are so upset about them not being shown.
It’s because Gig’s rotation might be not working properly. Despite Fiverr says everything is carried out the way it should be.

more than 100+ Peoples Complaining on forum that There gig is not appearing on search
Please share your source for this number of people complaining. I’ve been around, here on the forums for years, and it doesn’t look like any more people now, than those who are usually complaining about this sort of thing in the past. The issue is a DISPLAY error. It has nothing to do with a gig’s ability to perform. As Fiverr states – clearly – on everyone’s Gigs page, all gigs are still gaining analytics, those analytics just aren’t being DISPLAYED. Gigs and the algorithm are working just fine.

Because Like me Many Other Peoples Follow Gig Analytics Page Because its Really Helps us a lot to check How Our Gigs are performing.
I don’t know. It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success. The analytics stats are just numbers. Success does not depend upon those numbers. Success depends upon the ACTIONS sellers take, and, as far as I’ve seen, most of the sellers complaining about the display error, are also the same sellers that aren’t taking any productive ACTIONS to become successful.
Analytics stats will not guarantee success. Sitting around and watching numbers rise and fall won’t result in profitable gigs. Stop staring at the numbers, and start doing research, promotion, marketing, experimentation, taking risks, etc.

And Who said we are just sitting and watching numbers and Waiting for Success?
I Have 5* Rating Over more than 200 orders. 99 % Order completion, 100% response Rate and I remain Active on Fiverr Almost 24 hrs. Making Gigs Everyday Sharing My Gigs, Promoting My Gig and Also Taking Fiver Success Courses Searching on Internet and Taking Tips From Successful Buyer is My Daily Routine So Don’t Tell me that We are Just sitting Back and Waiting For Success.
Stats Are Important Because That’s How We Know Our Gigs Performance. That’s How we Know How Many Views Clicks or Impressions We Got After Sharing Our Gig. Stats Clearly Tells Us the Working of Our Gig. Also Fiver Algorithms Depend on Stats. Right Now Fiver algorithms did not get any response from Stats and That’s why Many Buyers Facing Issues in Gig Rotation. A Person has Only 2-3 Sales and he is in Best Selling page No 15 and A Person has 2000+ Sales with 5* Rating he is No where in Best Selling. Surely That’s a Problem Mate.
I Ask A question to the other User (misscrystal) that If Fiver Has a Option for Sellers Then Surely It Has Something to Do with Sellers and If That Option is not working Surely its a problem for Sellers. If its Only a Display Issue Then Fiver can Hire Many Programmers for 5$ to Fix Display Issue and If its Only a Display issue than answer one thing why its taking weeks to sort out??

thousands of sellers are facing this problem and they have years of experience
Show me the proof of these claims. Otherwise, you’re just making things up to support your perspective. There are no more people complaining now, than there have been over the years. If you need evidence, look back through the archives of the Fiverr forums.

please do some digging about the issue
Please listen to reason, instead of complaining about something that isn’t broken. The analytics display issue does not affect the performance of gigs in the search results. Fiverr has said exactly that. It merely hinders the display of statistics that are still being gathered (just not displayed).",N/A,"May 21, 2020 6:44 pm",2020-07-30 01:18:40.812976

None of this guarantees that you (specifically, in relation to your argument) are entitled to have your gigs appear on the first page of search results. Fiverr does not guarantee any gig placement in the search results, and they do not guarantee orders – to anyone – just because they have gigs or high ratings on Fiverr.

If its Only a Display Issue Then Fiver can Hire Many Programmers for 5$ to Fix Display Issue
Maybe Fiverr is not able to hire new people right now. The world is struggling through a pandemic, and millions of people are losing their jobs because companies cannot afford to keep as many employees as they once had. The world is not as black and white as you seem to view it to be.

If its Only a Display issue than answer one thing why its taking weeks to sort out??

We don’t know the algorithm because if sellers did it would be exploited. Perhaps your gigs are just being rotated down for a week or so. Who knows. Perhaps you had a bad hidden review. No one knows. Stop focussing on rank and focus on giving good customer service and high quality work. It will pay dividends rather than just doing SEO",N/A,"May 22, 2020 3:57 am",2020-07-30 01:18:46.231735

I am on fiverr from 2 years.
Like Me Many Users, I also Used analytics page to See their progress and That’s How we see our gig performance and that’s how we Speed up our Marketing and sharing policies in order to gain good impressions and Get some Good Response From Buyer.
My Question is Very Simple . Like You and 2 Other Persons in this forum , You are Saying Stats are Useless and This is Just a Display Issue . I Mean If Stats Are Working then why Fiverr Taking so much time to Resolve a display Issue? Even a Person who build website for 50$ knows how to Resolve Display issues and Fiverrr a millionaire Company Does not know how to resolve display issue???
Surely its not a display issue its more than this that’s why a millionaire company is struggling from weeks to sort out. Our Demand is Simple Fiverr Has Given us a Option to Keep track of our gigs performance ad activity and Previously with that it was working fine. Now If That option is hurting many sellers like me its our Right to ask fiverr to resolve this issue. My argument is not with you and I Have not started this with you. But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
Lastly Fiverr is Open for all its not mine or yours only property to work with. We work with sellers Give them Revisions and After a bunch of Hard work we get only 4$ , on the other hand without too much work fiverr take 3$ from per order . So If you calculate this , it will come up as a million dollar daily fiverr gets. So then They should show some maturity , Have capacity of bearing New Customers and They should be able to sort out Bugs like this.
These all are my opinion and way of thinking. If You and any person don’t like I am sorry and Please accept my apologize in advance. Thank you",N/A,"May 22, 2020 4:40 am",2020-07-30 01:18:49.025962

But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
I am not wrong, because I am expressing the exact comments Fiverr themselves have stated. Fiverr specifically says, on every seller’s Gigs page: ""We’re working on getting your Gigs’ impressions, clicks, and views back online. No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.""
Why is it so hard to believe what Fiverr is telling you?
If Fiverr says this is how things are, then this is how things are. You demanding to be given a different answer does not make Fiverr wrong. Fiverr is not lying to you.
vidvox:
So then They should show some maturity
You need to show some patience. Fiverr will fix the display issue when they fix the issue. You demanding to have what you want, right now, because you think Fiverr is immature, and not working fast enough for you, isn’t going to make them fix things any faster. The display issue will be fixed when it is fixed. Fiverr told you this. I am telling your this. And plenty of other forum users have told you this.
Your opinions are not how things work. I have proven this with Fiverr’s own statement on the issue. Everyone else can see the same exact Fiverr statement on their Gigs page. It is what Fiverr says it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 5:14 am",2020-07-30 01:18:50.612229

It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success.
I agree with you jonbaas.
I am curious to know what exactly people do when for example they see their impressions going down. I have seen a lot of threads where people are upset that these go down sometimes. Is there some sure way to make them go back up after they go down?
What kind of control did you have when you could see those stats that affected them and improved them?

Is there some sure way to make them go back up after they go down?
misscrystal:
What kind of control did you have when you could see those stats that affected them and improved them?
Well, as you know, none of us have control over impressions, so, in all honesty, there’s nothing any of us can do to make them go up again. I just ride out that wave, and let the algorithm do what it does. I don’t live and die by the things I cannot control. I may check them every once in a while, but I largely ignor them, and work on improving the things I can control.

I think people are obsessed with their stats.
I think there’s a big difference between being ‘obsessed’ with stats, and ‘interested’ in stats, yet a lot of the responses I’ve read on this thread suggest that even having a passing interest in stats is foolish and a waste of time. I simply can’t wrap my head around that way of thinking.
Do you need stats to sell? No, of course not. Just like you don’t need money to be happy. But it helps, right? Stats help you to make decisions about your business based on actual metrics, as opposed to speculation.
The metrics in Fiverr are woefully bad as-is. I’d love to know what keywords drove buyers to our gigs. I’d love to know which demos buyers listened to - how many times on average a buyer visited our gig before buying etc etc… All of these are metrics we could be shown, whilst still maintaining buyer privacy, and they would give us actionable insight to make changes to our gigs with.
The fact that Fiverr can’t even give us the absolute basic stats, for almost a month now, is the reason why people, myself included, get frustrated.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 6:26 am",2020-07-30 01:18:54.219290

This is exactly what Google Analytics could bring on table.
Fiverr could implement GA for L2 and TRS. It would be advantage for those who understand data analytics and can use it.
It would be also motivation for L0 and L1 for growth. The reward would be “real” analytics.

Once again I agree. That’s why I suggested that people do what they can to improve their gigs and how they process and deliver orders, as well as improving their skills if needed.
I also think fiverr does choose quality gigs for the first page at least, sometimes.
I mostly pay attention to my own category but skimming through each page of listings it does start to look like there is a descending order to the gigs somehow. Of course I don’t know exactly what fiverr considers high quality gigs, and they do shuffle gigs around but all we can do is be the best possible.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 7:03 am",2020-07-30 01:18:57.008367

It’s unfortunate if we’ve reached a point where we’re suggesting that we can only achieve quality by hiding useful information from people. That would suggest a total lack of trust. Can quality gigs, gig-SEO and useful metrics not all exist at the same time? We’re all grown-ups… most of us will do what is right for both us as sellers, and Fiverr as a platform. It’s in all our best interest to keep Fiverr ticking along nicely.

Well you say why can’t Fiverr trust all sellers.
With respect, you’ve paraphrased me a little there. What I said was that most of us will do the right thing, and for those who don’t, punishments exist to discourage bad behaviour, and I was referring only to being able to see some basic metrics related only to our own gigs, not giving out my username and password to random strangers, which is why I said we’re not quite comparing the same thing.
For clarity, my two pence on this is that Fiverr could and should give us more, higher quality metrics to work with. As Fiverr grows and evolves as a business (now an NYSE listed company, not some tin-pot freelance site), and as we all grow as sellers, why can’t we understand a little more about customer behaviour behind the scenes, when it’s related to our own gigs? That’s evolution. Exploitation will always happen, that’s what sensible risk-mitigation, rules and punishments exist for.
That’s my opinion, nothing more, and I totally get and respect that a number of people disagree with me.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 7:52 am",2020-07-30 01:18:59.073283

Absolutely agree with you. But something that I feel often gets missed in conversations, is that Fiverr has two sets of customers - the ones who buy the products, and the ones who pay the seller fees. We’re customers of Fiverr too, just a different type. It’s a cliche, but it’s true; without sellers there would be no Fiverr.
And for all the enormous improvements that buyers have seen in the way they interact with the Fiverr platform over the years, I feel that we as sellers haven’t seen quite the same level of improvements.
I’m hopeful that will change, and I’m excited about the Promoted Gigs feature that’s hopefully launching soon. It would make sense to bundle some new metrics in with that, so who knows?",N/A,"May 22, 2020 8:04 am",2020-07-30 01:18:59.890127

Then why is that so many people complaining about it?Please stop saying it is not a problem…
People are complaining because they think the analytics display issue is related to a gigs activity in the search results and this is not true. Fiverr has said exactly this.
Those who are complaining merely because they cannot see their analytics (which are still being calculated, just not shown), have a valid complaint. Those who are complaining that they think their gigs are failing because of the analytics display issue, are merely wasting time. The two things are not related. By Fiverr’s own statement, the analytics display issue has nothing to do with gigs in the search system. I will continue to remind people that there is no search results problem, until Fiverr specifically says otherwise. I am expressing the truth, as we know it.

My point is that my sales have been really good since I started my fiverr account and they dropped at the same time Fiverr stopped showing gig impressions. Obviously I am going to think there is a correlation and so will others who are having that same issue.
And, obviously, based upon what Fiverr has said, that would be a wrong assumption.
celebrawitch:
If you aren’t having any problems and doing so well with your business, why do you have so much time to spend on the forums when the problem doesn’t even concern you?
I choose to be here, and I choose to dedicate some of my time each day to help others. I also stand against misinformation – as I have, on the forum, for years. Just because I am successful with my sales, does not mean I should stop interacting here. My continued hope is that there are people who ARE willing to listen to reason, wisdom, and my expert advice… and those who listen can become as successful as I, and other veteran sellers, have become.
In fact, over the years, many sellers have thanked me for sharing my advice and insight here on the forums. I am honored to have been a part of the success many other former new sellers are now experiencing. If YOU don’t want to listen, that’s fine… clearly you don’t want to be helped right now.
celebrawitch:
Perhaps you shouldn’t give unsolicited advice when you don’t even know someone’s situation.
That’s the thing, though, in large part, I DO know the situations of most who are complaining. I’ve been here for years, and I have seen just about everything. I have also experienced what the loud voices are complaining about, and I have learned from those experience. It would be wonderful it those who are complaining about things that aren’t even true, would stop and look at the situation objectively, and realize that what they are doing is expending needless energy that could be better invested in becoming better sellers.

I did not need your patronizing reply.
And I, respectfully, don’t need you to be telling me not to stand up for reason, and voice an alternate perspective of things. This is a discussion forum… a civil discourse. If you want to believe what isn’t true, that’s fine, but it is not appropriate for you to say that I cannot oppose that misinformation.

Fiverr to tell sellers the whole truth about the issues they are facing?
Why do you assume Fiverr is lying? What reason would they have to lie about the search system? They’re not going to tell how HOW it works (that is proprietary information), so what do you hope to get out of this argument? Fiverr says the system is working, and gigs are still interacting in the system as they are supposed to… It is not broken merely because some sellers currently have their gigs in rotation, and don’t like it. I’ve had my gigs in rotation many times too, and yet, here I am… finding ways to earn sales. My gigs have bounced back numerous times. Yours will too.
bodmas:
what are you trying to achieve or your aim?
I have explained my aim in my previous post.
bodmas:
You expect Fiverr to say there is a search results issue till you believe…
I trust Fiverr, because there is no reason not to. Even when things aren’t going my way, I work on my gigs, I market, I promote, and I do what I need to do to remain relevant and successful. Complaining achieves nothing. Actions to better a struggle do.
bodmas:
anytime I see your response on any post, I feel somehow…
Very well. Be emotional. That doesn’t, however, make you right, when Fiverr has already stated the nature of the situation, and that it does not affect what you and others are complaining about.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 2:06 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:08.385347

This was the case everything was started. It seems like most of the sellers who had this experience on April 29th cannot remember it anymore. According to my opinion some sellers like me are still getting zero impressions, though the stats are not shown (though fiverr says it’s only a display issue, it’s not like that for the sellers who had this experience since April 29th). Zero impressions probably affect for the gig ranking. Sellers who didn’t experience the zero impression situation are not affected and their gigs are appearing on the search results as usual.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/4/5/4/454f2c6f68b463882714cb8850a1a5e47a4fefeb.jpeg,"May 22, 2020 2:24 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:09.253882

You don’t know what your stats are in the last month. How do you know that you’re “still getting zero impressions”? It sounds like you’re trying to mold your emotion-based opinion into fact, and you just don’t have any actual facts to support your opinion.

I’ve asked him if its a natural rotation or really a bug, because the rotation happened at the same time the gig analytics went offline. I’m still in doubt but I trust my friend about this, he said there’s a time that our gig will be on the last page for maybe a month, but it’ll go back as it is, and fiverr will give you a chance to shine again. I hope this comment will help ease my fellow freelancers. and I hope we can get back to the track as soon as possible. Cheers to us! and Godbless to us all.

Those who do not wish to accept facts/truth/how Fiverr works, are not likely to feel at ease. Let’s all just be patient, and let Fiverr fix the display error when they are able to fix it. None of us need the displayed statistics in order to connect to our target markets, and convince those customers to hire us.

I have seen a gig with 1star review on the first page of a niche in Fiverr. First page with 1 star review and 1 order for weeks.
I have noticed a lot of new gigs on the first page now too. It’s impossible to figure out how gigs are rotated.
Clearly there is much more than gig analytics determining where gigs are placed. Because those gigs must have terrible analytics aside from massive impressions which who knows why they deserve that.
I’ve seen new gigs without orders which never get orders stay on the first page month after month for no reason I could see, then later the person became a top rated seller, so there are things which fiverr likes about a gig that have nothing to do with how many orders it gets, or how new it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 10:19 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:17.259089

I track the stats for the month after I’ve made changes to my gig, including sales. Increased stats tend to lead to increased sales
Yes. However, impressions do not stay the same. They move up and down. Also, I’ve seen that simply editing a gig will set it back in the ranks. So to say you edit a gig trying to get more impressions would, based on my own experience, tend to backfire and do the opposite of what you hope for.

There are a lot of opinions about what is going on, so rather than sharing my opinion I’ll share my experience.
I originally saw my impressions drop to 0 randomly after having climbed up to around 90 a day beginning around the 28th of April.
I have had my most productive month-long period so far from halfway through April to about a week ago, with 27 orders overall and around 13 inquiries per day. I was getting so many orders that I marked myself as “out of office” for the better part of a week and a half to slow down. When I came back, my first day began with about 4 new inquiries and nothing else. Since then, I have received absolutely nothing, no messages or orders from new buyers (I’ve had two messages from returning buyers but no orders).
That is my experience. I’ve found my gig on the very last page of search results for about a week, so it’s searchable, but almost impossible to find.
As for my opinion, I want to believe it’s the system glitching but I’m just not sure. I heard there was a gig rotation around the same time so it might just be that. Nevertheless, I feel like an international company should be able to have fixed this glitch within a few days, let alone a month. Being new to Fiverr, I’m really not in much of a position to criticize, but I really hope this is a fluke and not how Fiverr normally operates, keeping us all in the dark like this.
If anyone more experienced has info on how Fiverr normally works it would be much appreciated! Have a great day/night everyone",N/A,"May 24, 2020 11:26 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:31.940687

Hello, you may have shot yourself in the foot by going out of office for a week and a half. I’m just guessing but that can sometimes lead to a slowdown in orders when you come back.
You also mentioned April 28 which seems to be about the time others report a slowdown. So it’s not possible to tell what happened in any particular case.
My theory is that there has been such an influx of new sellers that things are being adjusted to account for that.
If you check the number of sellers in any category now you will probably see a staggering amount of new sellers.

I am a bit confused by how you handle this issue. As you can imagine, displaying gig statistics is quite an important functionality for any fiverr seller on your platform. You even promote it as one of the basic functionalities of fiverr in your eLearning videos. And this is sure true as interpreting and reacting to gigs analytics data may have direct impact on the received orders.
Mistakes can happen and problems pop up every now and then in any company but I am left rather speechless how you handle this incident.
First, there is no transparent communication on this issue beside this orange box, which is telling the obvious, i.e. that the gigs statistics are not displayed and that you are working on it. But common, you have a blog, why not use it to communicate with your customers? Why are the gigs stats down? Have you been hacked? Did someone press delete accidentally? Did a server go down? How is the progress of fixing the issue so far? Anything?!
Instead people have to search through the forums for a thread, which is not even marked sticky, but people actually have to search for it. On top, the thread basically says the same as the orange box and is flooded by repeating questions of your customers. This is a pretty bad communication Fiverr team.
Moreover, asking in the forums, I was merely pointed to this thread, which doesn’t provide any information at all, instead of answering my questions, which are rather legit to most of us. On top, without having a chance to reply my thread was closed? Pretty strange way of addressing legit requests of your customers.
I hope you can use this current challenge to heavily improve the way you communicate incidents with your customers.
Happy to receive your feedback.
Cheers,
André",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:46 am",2020-07-30 01:19:32.752265

That’s a nice note. Well written. However, it seems to me thinking as if I were part of the management team on fiverr, that it’s not a good idea to share secrets or the internal workings of what is always going on. Fiverr is a publicly held company. How the site is run is a subject that is not to be made public. Internal decisions on any changes to the site are not going to be announced.
We sellers have to work with the changes that come along and do the best we can.
As far as I know, the fiverr team does not read posts here most of the time.
What if those stats are being eliminated? What if they are being changed in a big way? They can’t tell us in advance. They have a large company on the stock exchange here. Any sort of advance announcements like that could affect stock shares, either good or bad.",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:50 am",2020-07-30 01:19:33.143155

@misscrystal
,
thanks! Actually, it is not about sharing secrets at all. it is about communication. Incident response and incident response communication are standard processes of any company. It is not a binary decision to either publicly disclose non-secret data or not disclose anything because internal processes might be affected. In both cases, transparent communication is key.
I am not saying that the public should decide how the side is run. It is really just about communicating issues that affect the platform as a whole to its customers. I think this is a basic process for any company like mentioned above.

I’m taking a stab in the dark here that the two things (metrics not showing AND search visibility down) are actually two separate incidents.
I rarely use the metrics side of things as I personally feel that I can’t change it based on those graphs and in most cases never corrolate with the oprders that I’m getting based on impressions etc.
In terms of the search visibility I think that they’ve probably made their search algorithm a little too harsh on some ranking factors hence why peoples searches are down. Although this isn’t Google (which has over 200 separate ranking factors) it still is a search engine and needs to be twaked periodically.
Judging by the influx of questions regarding this I feel it needs to be tweaked again.
As for my gigs visibility? It seems that my orders are fluctuating between getting a big fat 0 per day to up to 10 per day.

A central place where this issue is communicated. At least they could mark this thread as sticky.

It does not matter what is truth. The truth is what people think is truth.
The facts are:
Fiverr planned IT maintenance for certain date and time. As far as I know and some people confirmed in forum the maintenance has not happened yet. Fiverr did not communicate any further about it. Not good.
Fiverr announced N/A in analytics long time ago and confirmed they are going to fix it. A lot of people who are also not genius like me suppose that it should have been already fixed. Fiverr does not communicate any progress, anything about it. Not good.

I’m in complete agreeance with you. As a Level 2 Seller with 200+ reviews on this specific gig alone, it doesn’t seem logical (or fair but we won’t go into that) that “randomly” my Best Selling gig would lose it’s search authority to instead preference gigs with limited credibility.
I read one post that possibly they’ve skewed the algorithm to favor new Sellers amidst the COVID-19 crisis? While in a way I understand the logic, I too spent nearly a year putting my blood, sweat and tears into creating something sustainable out of this gig - proving my capabilities, commitment to customer service, etc.

@vidvox
The thing about this forum is that it’s normal for people to have different opinions. That does NOT mean you get to insult them or talk badly about them if you don’t agree with them.
I don’t need to come here and try to explain things to people. I don’t get paid for this. I do it because of the misguided idea that people like you might learn something. What do I get out of this discussion? Nothing at all.
Someone might say to themselves, she has been here over 7 years, does pretty good here. So maybe she is trying to tell us something we don’t know.
But instead of that all anyone keeps saying is
WAA WAA WAAAAAH my gigs arent’ showing, I’m not getting orders, it’s from the statistics not showing when will it be fixed WAAAHHHH!
I’m finally convinced that some can’t learn, can’t understand, can’t see or take in any new things that someone says to them. It’s not possible.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:46 am",2020-07-30 01:19:50.989540

Everyone complaining is new to fiverr or they found their old account and logged in. I give more value to words of one top rated seller than hundreds of new sellers related to this topic.
I would also really like to see my stats but even without them I can say that I have a satisfactory number of orders and I’m here for 20-25 days. I only saw my stats once before it got broken and they were really discouraging but they didn’t mean a lot.
So listen to seniors and try to understand what are they saying, they rarely say something straight to the point but let you think about it and find solution for your problem with their guidance. I agree some of them do write in quite a negative and sometimes irritating way but they still write to help you.

They Don’t understand a Basic thing that If Fiverr has a Option and its not working then surely there is a problem.
They understand that there’s a problem. Nobody is denying that there’s a problem with display.
However, just because some sellers are not getting messages/orders since that problem started, doesn’t mean that not getting orders is related to the display error. If it was related to display error, nobody would receive orders; but if you read some other topics, you will see that many sellers (a lot more than 2-3) are getting orders, and even earning well.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 12:36 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:55.112783

Honestly, I rarely change it, and I know that causes me to drop back in rankings. When I do though, it’s important for me to see how that affects changes in the long run as, like I said, my gig is niche. I understood that going in. The only thing I can use to evaluate the interest (note that I’m not saying success) is in analytics, as my sales aren’t frequent enough to give good data.
I wonder if this whole argument is just the difference in perspectives. For those who have a steady stream of sales, the analytics page is essentially useless. You know sales are going to come in and your gig is running like a well-oiled machine; what’s the point of checking impressions, then?
For those who don’t expect many sales (like me), the analytics data actually serve a role as they’re an important indicator of interest. I only get a few sales a month, which I’m fine with, so I need to rely on other indicators for gig performance. They’re not perfect, but it generally helps me predict if a sale is coming or if my ads on other sites are actually driving traffic to my gig.
Of course, there are plenty of new recruits who are using analytics as a source of hope, and that’s where a lot of problems come up, as they’re not entirely reliable and don’t guarantee anything.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:01 pm",2020-07-30 01:19:59.788403

Your discussion makes sense. You have such a unique gig. I assume most here have gigs that are more traditional.
My theory is that if your gigs can have a way to stand out somehow from the rest in a good way then you won’t need the analytics, for those who are in a highly competitive group of sellers. That way might simply be having outstanding talent.
If a seller has been plodding along with bad graphics and a gig that doesn’t stand out somehow from the rest and getting impressions and sales they’ve been very lucky. That might be changing now that half the world’s population has suddenly decided to become sellers on fiverr.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:05 pm",2020-07-30 01:20:00.189303

I totally agree with this. When my gig was getting almost around 2-3 orders a day, I didn’t give my analytics any attention.

I would hazard a guess that your impressions have gone way down if you stopped getting orders, if you regularly got orders before.
I can tell where my gig is located approximately and how many impressions it gets by how many messages and orders I get.
Impressions are not the whole story since you can get a lot of very low quality impressions, where your gig is actually being displayed, but not in a place anyone is looking for it to buy it.
It’s always possible that you can have lots of impressions without any sales if your gig is shown only to a certain demographic, certain country, certain out of the way place, where it is assured it won’t get sales.
We all would like our gigs to be shown mostly in one or two countries known to represent the most buyers but it’s possible to have it displayed where no one ever wants it also. Fiverr is good at showing impressions where it’s not going to get many sales sometimes as part of it’s rotation.

Of course, I get what you’re saying. I think I meant to say it would be helpful to see all the analytics, such as clicks combined with impressions, so that I could tell people if were clicking but being turned away by my gig description or something. I don’t see why they would, it’s worked fantastic in the past… but who knows. (EDIT: Just read your edit, I see how it could also be the competition showing up)

Thank you for saying that, that makes a lot of sense.
I also read something about “the curse of the Level 1 seller” where apparently once people reach Level 1 their orders slow dramatically or just flat out stop. Not sure how accurate that is hahah, nor if it would affect me (I qualify for Level 1 but am waiting on the evaluation.) I think everything just came together at the very wrong time, with my almost-leveling up, plus the bug, plus all the new sellers, plus the rotation, plus me having been out of office recently… really killed my momentum hahah. But, listening to what you’ve said has given me hope for the future so thanks a ton for talking with me

Because you are doing well thats why you dont need to check your gig stats
I never checked my gig stats them when I was a newbie, either.
I figured there were more important things to be done like fine-tuning my gig, creating new gigs, and reading everything I could on the Forum about how to do so.
I also listened to the advice of the Forum member who had much knowledge to share. I honestly have not missed seeing my gig stats.
Besides as Fiverr says, No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual. And I find that to be true because I continue to get orders from new buyers and my regulars alike.
Maybe those who see a dip in their orders and such should think about how to improve their profile and gigs rather than blaming the inability to see their gig metrics.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:36 am",2020-07-30 01:20:10.302864

It’s crazy how someone who is not a fiverr staff nor a fiverr web developer or site engineer seems to know how fiverr works. Since 2014 when I signed up, there has always been gig stats. Fiverr can say things to save face or calm people, but don’t try to make others look stupid.
Everyone has a right to say what they are experiencing. Just don’t tell them nothing is wrong or they shouldn’t talk about it or that what they say doesn’t matter. It doesn’t make sense. You might think you are trying to make sense, but you are not.

With these replies, I could swear that there are 2-3 people getting paid to calm people down because of the panic this bug is creating.
As I said earlier, the gigs stopped rotating and you might be lucky to be on the first or second page when it stopped. However, there are people stuck on the last page.
I receive atleast two messages on Fiverr everyday and ever since this bug started, I have received 0. 0. I have like 5 friends on Fiverr that the same has happened to. Either their gigs disappeared to the last page or they can’t even find their gigs anymore. On the other hand , you will find gigs with 1 star reviews , 2 star reviews on the first page. And these gigs have been on the first page for weeks now. That would never happen if everything was normal.
Yes you’re lucky, your gigs are working fine because the platform collapsed when you were on the first page or so, but you can’t use your own privileges to downplay what everyone else is going through. That makes no sense at all.
As it has been said repeatedly here, if it was a just a display issue, Fiverr would have solved it in a day. IT IS WAY MORE THAN THAT. The N/A bug has messed up the algorithm but Fiverr won’t tell us that because that will make them lose people.
Waking up to see replies dismissing everyone’s claims as “illogical” or just replying with “Fiverr has already said it doesn’t affect so it doesn’t ” make me sick.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 5:22 pm",2020-07-30 01:20:14.810797

We are also speaking of online traffic, I think it is more than fair to say that it should be much higher since most people are in their homes throughout the pandemic.
Many countries have also opened tattoo shops, my country included. Which would suggest more online traffic.
Lastly, there are multiple people with the same problem. They are not all in the Tattoo Design category.

In logo design section you will get “156,739 Services available” and everybody has an opportunity for bid. So, 100 bid is not less against of 156,739 seller?

There are a lot of hassles in buyer request options!

Actually, the OP’s idea isn’t so bad. If you have to pay a nickel or a quarter to post (buyers) then that would deter sellers from posting/advertising their gig.
I am willing to pay a quarter for better quality sellers. Perhaps that would make more qualified/seasoned freelancers to bid.
The time to use BR is when the market is saturated with 100,000 or more. It’s daunting to search for the right seller. And, don’t give me advice to look for 5 star sellers.

I can see why people might think this a good idea,but the truth is that the reason Fiverr is as popular as it is, is that it’s so easy to use, free both to post a buyer request and respond to it … and Fiverr’s business model isn’t about competing with downverk or any of the others
At the moment things are a mess because of the pandemic … but my feeling is the spam buyer requests need a “report” button … and new sellers need to learn from people who know and care about them, rather than “gurus” on youtube.
Newbies need to think for themselves, learn and approach their Fiverr careers more professionally.
That would be far more useful than putting barriers in their way with no explanation as to why …

One issue might be is that you offer to do Matlab assignments. Fiverr ToS not to do school work for students. The ToS state that homework is a:
Third party TOS violation - By taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) you are actively taking part in a violation of the integrity code of most, if not all, schools and academic institutions. This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities.

What are Skill Tests and what do they do?
If you’ve explored the options on your profile, you may have found the Skill Tests. These currently have no active benefit to Sellers unless a Buyer specifically looks for them. Relevant results cannot be placed in gigs and they can only be seen in the Seller’s profile.

The main problem for us on Fiverr
Certification places should have standards, especially online. (Google search results for “ExpertRating reviews” avg. 4.5 of 5.)
With so many different people taking the tests just for the sake of taking it (like here on Fiverr) it’s difficult to impossible to even review questions with low ‘right answer’ rates. So they rely on a ‘tell us if anything is wrong’ section at the end of the test. The problem with that is remembering exactly what was wrong with exactly which question. And forget it if there’s problems on more than one question. I’m sure there are people who can remember such details under normal circumstances, but under the timed pressure of taking a test? That is not the best environment for stimulating memory of issues with the test itself.
In trying to report issues, I’ve tried copying the section of text (didn’t work) and taking a screenshot of an error question (I couldn’t refer to the screenshot without leaving the window, which automatically failed me, even after the test was ‘ended’). I understand why you can’t copy text in the tests, but that leads to the aforementioned issue about memory and reporting.
Collection of noted issues
(Some of these issues are more prevalent than others.)
No correct answer
Identical answers
Poor grammar/spelling/punctuation
Outdated questions/answers (which places an additional negative of easier cheating)
Disconnections leading to automatic failures
Missing images (where the question prompts to refer to such)
Minor:
No randomization for layout or order in retakes.
Textbook-answer questions.
The test offers ‘multiple-possible answers’ option. Underutilized. (test: skill vs knowledge)
Potential fix?
I firmly think people shouldn’t complain about issues without offering a possible solution. So here is one that I think should be in the realm of possibility to easily implement. (I’ll admit: I’m not a programmer, so I don’t know how difficult it would actually be to code.)
There should be a way to flag a question from within the test itself. Even if it doesn’t allow an explanation, and (really) especially since you don’t want to take time from the test itself to fill something out, if the same question gets flagged by enough test-takers, it could/should be more closely looked at by the test ‘proctors’.
Dear Fiverr,
Please connect with ExpertRating about this. For the sake of Buyers, Sellers, and your own reputation. You promote professionalism. You are a platform of such great opportunities, but contracting out your tests to a questionable third-party is not helping.",N/A,3,"Nov 15, 2019 9:32 am",uk1000,1,"Good idea. I agree there should be some way of flagging bad questions on the tests so they can be fixed (like suggested, Fiverr should be able to send that info/data back to the skill test providers). Hopefully that would fix the current tests or speed up fixing of them.
I agree quite a few/many of the tests are outdated and they could do with new tests for new topics (as well as updating any existing tests so they’re still up to date) or tests based on open source software or lower priced software in addition to the current tests. eg. one test requires very high priced software when questions using an open source alternative could be done instead for the same topic.
I assumed there was some randomisation in the tests but if there isn’t, doing that would help stop cheating.",N/A,"Nov 13, 2019 6:02 pm",2020-07-30 01:21:56.030572

I firmly think people shouldn’t complain about issues without offering a possible solution. So here is one that I think should be in the realm of possibility to easily implement. (I’ll admit: I’m not a programmer, so I don’t know how difficult it would actually be to code.)
There should be a way to flag a question from within the test itself. Even if it doesn’t allow an explanation, and (really) especially since you don’t want to take time from the test itself to fill something out, if the same question gets flagged by enough test-takers, it could/should be more closely looked at by the test ‘proctors’.

I agree quite a few/many of the tests are outdated and they could do with new tests for new topics (as well as updating any existing tests so they’re still up to date) or tests based on open source software or lower priced software in addition to the current tests. eg. one test requires very high priced software when questions using an open source alternative could be done instead for the same topic.
I can see where you’re coming from. While it would be impossible to have tests for all the possible software for every genre of gig, some tests for the more popular free/open programs could be built.
Though, on further thought, those high-priced program licencors might have paid the ExpertRating ‘school’ to make tests for those programs. I know colleges have contracts/licences/accreditation to teach using certain textbooks/software/standards. This can be good, in cases like standards for GAAP or making sure students have a minimum knowledge of Microsoft Office programs. In contrast, I can recall making due with GIMP when I had Photoshop assignments (ran out of time in the library, finished at home), and basic Wordpad when the assignment was suppose to be done in aforementioned Office (built the basic assignment at home, finished at school).",N/A,"Nov 14, 2019 5:16 pm",2020-07-30 01:21:56.423185

Certification places should have standards, especially online. (Google search results for “ExpertRating reviews” avg. 4.5 of 5.)
With so many different people taking the tests just for the sake of taking it (like here on Fiverr) it’s difficult to impossible to even review questions with low ‘right answer’ rates. So they rely on a ‘tell us if anything is wrong’ section at the end of the test. The problem with that is remembering exactly what was wrong with exactly which question. And forget it if there’s problems on more than one question. I’m sure there are people who can remember such details under normal circumstances, but under the timed pressure of taking a test? That is not the best environment for stimulating memory of issues with the test itself.
In trying to report issues, I’ve tried copying the section of text (didn’t work) and taking a screenshot of an error question (I couldn’t refer to the screenshot without leaving the window, which automatically failed me, even after the test was ‘ended’). I understand why you can’t copy text in the tests, but that leads to the aforementioned issue about memory and reporting.

I agree, to an extent. However this goes back to ‘older tests are easier to cheat’ problem.
More minor of a gripe is that it still costs the full price to take. Not that I’m going to take it, but basic supply/demand logic. I kind of wonder how many have bought-and-taken that specific test in the last year, and if lowering the price might actually make people willing to buy just for the certification.

What are Skill Tests and what do they do?
If you’ve explored the options on your profile, you may have found the Skill Tests. These currently have no active benefit to Sellers unless a Buyer specifically looks for them. Relevant results cannot be placed in gigs and they can only be seen in the Seller’s profile.

The main problem for us on Fiverr
Certification places should have standards, especially online. (Google search results for “ExpertRating reviews” avg. 4.5 of 5.)
With so many different people taking the tests just for the sake of taking it (like here on Fiverr) it’s difficult to impossible to even review questions with low ‘right answer’ rates. So they rely on a ‘tell us if anything is wrong’ section at the end of the test. The problem with that is remembering exactly what was wrong with exactly which question. And forget it if there’s problems on more than one question. I’m sure there are people who can remember such details under normal circumstances, but under the timed pressure of taking a test? That is not the best environment for stimulating memory of issues with the test itself.
In trying to report issues, I’ve tried copying the section of text (didn’t work) and taking a screenshot of an error question (I couldn’t refer to the screenshot without leaving the window, which automatically failed me, even after the test was ‘ended’). I understand why you can’t copy text in the tests, but that leads to the aforementioned issue about memory and reporting.
Collection of noted issues
(Some of these issues are more prevalent than others.)
No correct answer
Identical answers
Poor grammar/spelling/punctuation
Outdated questions/answers (which places an additional negative of easier cheating)
Disconnections leading to automatic failures
Missing images (where the question prompts to refer to such)
Minor:
No randomization for layout or order in retakes.
Textbook-answer questions.
The test offers ‘multiple-possible answers’ option. Underutilized. (test: skill vs knowledge)
Potential fix?
I firmly think people shouldn’t complain about issues without offering a possible solution. So here is one that I think should be in the realm of possibility to easily implement. (I’ll admit: I’m not a programmer, so I don’t know how difficult it would actually be to code.)
There should be a way to flag a question from within the test itself. Even if it doesn’t allow an explanation, and (really) especially since you don’t want to take time from the test itself to fill something out, if the same question gets flagged by enough test-takers, it could/should be more closely looked at by the test ‘proctors’.

As a buyer I ordered a gig, the seller oversold himself and could not deliver. He had said he will make up and handle the 2nd phase so I did not cancel order on him, so he can make up for it on a subsequent task that apparently was more capable of. Only to also not deliver on this 2nd task, by means of not even responding. He actually requested a refund via CS and I did receive the funds back.
Before the refund was processed, I posted a review, as it was my responsibility to share my experience with others as this is the whole purpose of reviews.
Obviously he did not like the review and had also asked me to not post a review while he handles the refund.
After refund, he asked me to speak to CS to have the review removed.
I ignored him.
So what does he do now? He places an order on one of my low cost gigs to only do the same as ‘revenge’ and also give me a low rating and affect my overall 5-star.
I have no plans to accept or deliver this gig or even message him, and I think Fiverr should handle such via some processes so it does not affect my ranking, but for goodness sake, we need some control of which gigs to accept and not to be able to handle such orders from such people.
(note: this was a gig that I actually wanted to remove but not got around to it. When I received notification new order pending requirements, I managed to delete this gig before buyer was able to complete the requirements. Still he was able to submit the requirements and submit the order and countdown commence. Maybe helpful for others to know what happens in such cases)
He asking me to remove his review and now harassing me this way, should his account not be at risk of closure?
and if due to my case, he does get his account removed, he will most likely attack me from another account and try to do the same. Hence why and another reason we need to curate and accept or decline orders as needed and even filters to not accept new buyers and to be able to see details about this new buyer especially when they are under a new account.
Wanted to hear what others have to suggest and how to handle it, besides contacting CS.

Unfortunately, if this person is that vengeful, they can create as many accounts as they like and order from you only to harm your reputation here - we do not have a tool that lets us cancel because we have a bad feeling about an order unfortunately.

I see an option within Resolution Center to checkbox option to ask client to cancel order, but not sure if I should pursue this or not as obviously he will ignore it.
But then I noticed in requirements, I had a Requirement, ‘you must have X’
and his reply was "" I do not have X""
so even this should be enough on its own to have CS cancel this order, so should such not be an automated option to auto not accept such orders if requirements are not met?
All this is a huge time waster, and that is why we need Fiverr to adapt to give us control and not waste our time with such cases. This will easily eat up a day or more in hours communicating with CS etc, that we hardly all have.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:02 am",2020-07-30 01:22:15.196186

He wanted to cancel and refund me, and I am the one that suggested do not cancel as it will affect your rating and to make up for it for subsequent task he was more skilled to complete.
He then promised to commit, and only to then receive a message that he has no more time for this as he spent too much time and was going to request a refund, so he falsely promised again. And to top it off, when I told him I fixed what he could not, and sent him the details for the subsequent task, he simply ignored my message.
So do you really think I was not ‘too nice’ - when i spent more time than he did and fixed alone what he could not, with such advertised skills and making promises (twice) to only be able to get away with it, when I tried to save his account from ’ a cancel order’ in the 1st instance?
I had no option since I had no response from him for subsequent task to be able to leave a review before this option expired for me.
And I had lost faith in him and no idea if there was going to be a refund anyway coming through. I would not trust such a person even he did say a refund was requested.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 8:40 am",2020-07-30 01:22:16.431146

I am from Guyana and i have been directing thousands of individuals towards fiverr.
I only recently had complaints from many persons about the same issues.
#1 the area code for Guyana is 592 fiverr currently has 595
This would make it impossible for them to verify…
The next thing is more scary
#2 Every time someone complains about it the disable the account.
This is a very unfair business practice…
It is called discrimination…
Very Sad that fiverr a company that for the last three years I have sent so many persons too is doing this to the persons that help build their network. Which btw is getting very slow as of late.
I am hoping that they fix this issue as I will start redirecting persons from my network which now has over 200,000 people in it. most of which are Freelancers on the international market place.
FIX IT Please as it will be viewed as discrimination against third world countries. Thank You…",N/A,"Mar 29, 2017 4:41 pm",2020-07-30 01:22:32.173288

Paypal is not available in all countries, so we can’t withdraw our earnings. Would be great if you add skrill as third payment processor.

First of all, I’ve seen some posts about it and sorry for the new topic, but they were dead since summer, so I thought best to create another one.
Paypal isn’t available in some countries, and Payoneer takes a lot of fees while withdrawing money from ATMs (talking from experience as I’ve used it for almost 3 years now). Bank transfer not an option as well.
Skrill is one of the best payment methods out there. I’ve used it for some of my work in the past, and I’ve connected it with my bank account here in my country and it has very very small fees. It really has helped me avoid some of the large fees Payoneer has.
If somebody from staff sees this post then should we make a poll or something to make this happen? Let us know please.

They’re making changes to fiverr almost daily. You won’t see all of the changes as some arent visible to us frontenders. But it sounds like you’re referring to one of their recent dashboard updates.
Unfortunately, there’s no way to go back. They won’t change it up like that often, so try and get used to the new arrangements, Its likely here to stay for awhile.
I have logged on and then felt the need to double check the sites fingerprint because of the drastic change that happened overnight…but It’s normal for sites like fiverr as they have to adapt to the ever growing community, and sometimes you have to move things around to make everything fit. =P",N/A,"Jul 27, 2020 10:40 pm",2020-07-30 01:23:53.308441

I’m a freelancer on Fiverr.com 1 providing web development gigs. So far, whenever I send the delivery to the buyer, there is no sort of protection at all. There are mutliple ways to solve this.
Preview Only:
One way in which this could be solvable is creating a “Preview Only” whenever you deliver html files. Now I have no idea if this is possible for other files like .php, but usually this is how it works with market places for website themes and such. You can only preview it, and usually the code is hidden even in inspect it can be hidden in a lot of ways. The only way is if you buy the theme that you actually receive it by email.
The Idea:
My idea does not mean that the buyer has to receive the work via his/her email address. My idea is that the buyer can preview his/her new website, but only through Fiverr’s preview system. Which would obviously have a watermark also at the top that says “Delivery Preview”. The buyer can see the new website, and then if he/she likes it and clicks on “Accept Final Delivery”, a new option will popup that says “Download Source Files”, but only after accepting the final delivery. This can be one of many protection methods.
The Problem & Solution:
Another problem is after the delivery has been accepted. The buyer could just request a refund before the seller gets paid, which is a really big issue. Now the solution to this could be that instead of making a review “Optional” what about making it required? Just at least stars, no need for a certain message, just rating the buyer using stars shall be enough or just a Like/Dislike button, then that shall not allow the buyer to request a refund. This may be very unfair, but lets say that there was a problem after the delivery, a problem with code or a certain optimization and responsiveness. Perhaps the buyer can return to the order and request a “Technical Support”, which then wouldn’t cancel the order, it will notify the seller that there was an issue with the order. That would allow an easy solution to it.

Making any review required is not acceptable. Nowhere is a review something that is required.
It’s not an issue for a buyer to ask for a refund as long as you can refuse.",N/A,"Jul 18, 2020 10:46 am",2020-07-30 01:24:17.531748

Also, the point of what I said about reviews is just making it a simple Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down button that would tell the seller how did the buyer feel about the delivery and not a week later.
I’ve known sellers having their work stolen cause a buyer asked for a refund and after contacting CS, they did not care at all about the seller.
Also, ignoring it will cause the buyer to go to CS in which will force the seller to give a refund if the CS believe that the buyer must get a refund. It’s possible and it happens all the time. Also, some buyers may even result in threatening the seller that they’ll give a bad review, you can read stories here on the forum about people experiencing it, weather or not, both seller and buyer must have some type of protection correct, but the seller is the one at risk and not the buyer.
It’s just an opinion that I personally believe must be addressed as I’ve visited other sites where the CS and their seller protection methods are actually great. Especially marketplaces for developers and designers.",N/A,"Jul 18, 2020 9:19 pm",2020-07-30 01:24:17.945095

I’m a freelancer on Fiverr.com 1 providing web development gigs. So far, whenever I send the delivery to the buyer, there is no sort of protection at all. There are mutliple ways to solve this.
Preview Only:
One way in which this could be solvable is creating a “Preview Only” whenever you deliver html files. Now I have no idea if this is possible for other files like .php, but usually this is how it works with market places for website themes and such. You can only preview it, and usually the code is hidden even in inspect it can be hidden in a lot of ways. The only way is if you buy the theme that you actually receive it by email.
The Idea:
My idea does not mean that the buyer has to receive the work via his/her email address. My idea is that the buyer can preview his/her new website, but only through Fiverr’s preview system. Which would obviously have a watermark also at the top that says “Delivery Preview”. The buyer can see the new website, and then if he/she likes it and clicks on “Accept Final Delivery”, a new option will popup that says “Download Source Files”, but only after accepting the final delivery. This can be one of many protection methods.
The Problem & Solution:
Another problem is after the delivery has been accepted. The buyer could just request a refund before the seller gets paid, which is a really big issue. Now the solution to this could be that instead of making a review “Optional” what about making it required? Just at least stars, no need for a certain message, just rating the buyer using stars shall be enough or just a Like/Dislike button, then that shall not allow the buyer to request a refund. This may be very unfair, but lets say that there was a problem after the delivery, a problem with code or a certain optimization and responsiveness. Perhaps the buyer can return to the order and request a “Technical Support”, which then wouldn’t cancel the order, it will notify the seller that there was an issue with the order. That would allow an easy solution to it.

A solution for what exactly? I understand the scenario you’re describing but has that ever been a problem to you or it’s just hypothetical? How many times you’ve seen yourself in the situation you described?
I’ve been on Fiverr for nearly 3 years, probably been active (taking orders) for 2.5 years and I have never had the problem you’re describing.

Is it really that big of an issue? This and the first part of your message.
The fact that creators can be scammed is a real thing in the freelance community overall, not only Fiverr.
Still, I do not hear an outcry of scammed sellers, sorry. If it was that bad, people would not be using this site to sell their work. And Fiverr would take actions (maybe close to ones you described).
But it’s not true. Sellers provide their work and Fiverr is satisfied with it.

I’m not addressing it as the end of Fiverr, cause it’s not.
But nowadays, I’m afraid of providing the source files. Knowing that if the buyer will do it or not is unexpected. It can just happen like that and all of my work is gone. I’ve visited other sites that have this “Preview Mode” feature.

Consider this: why would Fiverr let you have more than one account and why would they make it possible for you to pretend to be someone else “commenting” on your gig – which isn’t even possible?
That’s fraud and an irrational trick. Why would Fiverr allow you to commit fraud? It’s not a gig. They have systems in place to prevent people from gaming the system.
Tricks don’t get sales. Meeting the demands of your target audience gets sales.

This is same everywhere on almost every problematic topic.
They behave just like Fiverr police.
And, the most annoying thing is that those people will write things so the person with a problem will get more problems and he is just busy replying to them again and again. So, Fiverr TOS is a holy book for them.
They make the person with problem feel stupid like if someone has broken any TOS unintentionally, now he has not right to live because they will send so many sarcastic comments right away. I am sure something is happening. Everything is being controlled.
I can post many incidents from other forum topic to prove myself if anyone wants.

You can always choose not to respond if it bothers you to spend a lot of time responding to posts you don’t like.
animcreativity:

What’s happening is that almost every day there’s someone who broke the rules (sometimes unintentionally, sometimes because they thought that the rules shouldn’t apply to them, sometimes because they haven’t bothered to learn how the site works so they see a bug when it’s a feature), and then complains that they got a warning or a permanent ban for breaking the rules. Time after time after time, the same thing is happening… So yes, there will be sarcastic responses. Especially to something as silly as “I’m giving a warning to Fiverr” (seriously, nobody cares about a random user giving Fiverr a warning on the forum, Fiverr least of all; it has a zero effect on anything).",N/A,"Jul 25, 2020 4:16 am",2020-07-30 01:26:13.513010

Yes, I should stay low because I am not buying anything from them.
I am selling. If it was the other way round. I mean if it was a buyer on forums posting their complaint. Then the things would have been different, you bet. The 10/1 ratio.
I am sure that “I am giving first warning to Fiverr” has made no impact to Fiverr and to you or anyone else my friend.
But, the thing that makes difference today for me is that I even raised my voice and I do not feel like a sheep because my voice was considered lower than the buyer even when I wrote a very professional mail to the support staff like buyer did (sent a copy already to you on other thread).
I must have been be treated equal. That is what bothers me the most. Like what if in future? What if I have a super level seller account and my whole life relies on that account. Is it too much to ask for a reply?

Oh and you again didn’t read fiverr help page, right?
We all get different level of support.
It’s even written in fiverr help page that different level sellers gets different time for response. For example if you are level 2 or a Top rated seller one of the perks will be that you will get a priority customer service responses.

Here on Fiverr forums, you cannot satisfy all brains
I am not sure what is your problem still.
You cake and asked why you got a warning, we explained why.
Then you said you have a different problem and that’s support is not responding you. And we told you that their response is prolonged right now and up to 10 days in this crazy virus situation.
Then you again changed your story and now your problem became that you want the same response time for buyers and sellers. Well guess what? We all have different level of support even among sellers.
Now your problem that your message was automatically censored and we again had to reassure you that there is no conspiracy behind it. Even the mod had to come in to explain in.
Now your problem that we put likes on each other posts.

Should there be a voice calling option on fiverr?,Fiverr Site,27,186,51,"Jul 13, 2020 2:50 am","Jul 13, 2020 3:12 am","Jul 24, 2020 12:56 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/should-there-be-a-voice-calling-option-on-fiverr/483861,"visualstudios, tech_treon, shivathmaj1, frank_d, vibronx, zerlina84, heyfellow1, humanissocial",tech_treon,3,"So, I would like to ask my fellow sellers, would they like it seeing a calling option (both video and normal calls) apart from fiverr chat to communicate with their customers.
According to me, chats are less engaging (however, everyone has their own perspective of seeing things), if me and my client decide mutually, that we can have a quick call instead of chatting which will save time too (Personally, I don’t like writing long texts to clients explaining them how my process works)
It is easier to connect to potential customers and more than that it becomes easy to explain them some complex topics and if we are able to connect well, chances are that the buyer can convert.
These 2 points right now are there in my mind, however there are some cons for it too. So, I would like to ask my fellow members whether they would like the calling feature or not.
Yes, I would love to see the calling feature as an addition in the near futute
No, the calling feature is not something I want

Regular",17,"I can see how it would be useful for some sellers, but I would not want it personally. Buyers would want to call you about every single little issue that they might have. You would have to schedule the call, and that might be difficult if you are in different time-zones. If you are responding in writing, you are free to respond whenever you want to. In that sense, it also takes out some of the freedom of being a freelancer.
It would also lead to a lot of wasted time. Buyers will be more likely to rant about unnecessary things in a call or to expect us to chit-chat. I simply do not have time for that.
Also, it is easier to understand and refer to all the requirements if you have a written record, and it also makes it easier for Fiverr to protect sellers and enforce ToS if everything is in writing.",N/A,"Jul 13, 2020 3:12 am",2020-07-30 01:27:39.917825

If you are responding in writing, you are free to respond whenever you want to. In that sense, it also takes out some of the freedom of being a freelancer.
Yeah, I got your point and I agree with you on that. But many a times, we have clients sending messages like hey, please can you explain me your that how we would move ahead with the order and explain how your process works?, I have to send long explanations on questions like these and these clients in the end do not reply again, so that would save my time.
Also, as in your case, you can talk to the clients and tell them that you’ll call them on a specific time everyday (of course according to the time zone) and give updates regularly and give updates regarding the order.
Or maybe fiverr can add an additional feature of setting on/off availability for calls which can help in this case",N/A,"Jul 13, 2020 3:31 am",2020-07-30 01:27:40.326541

Voice calls didn’t make sense when Fiverr was a marketplace for $5 quick jobs. Now you have people selling stuff for thousands, it’s a necessity. I wouldn’t drop thousands on something without speaking to the seller on a call first. Reviews can be faked, portfolio can be faked, even text messaging can be faked.

I agree completely, but the implementation at the moment can’t really be used to build trust for higher price sales since it’s only available once an order starts.

You can consider purchasing the same product the buyer has to make the video. Of course, cost should be considered as well.
Don’t do this. You’re putting your money forward, will have to wait at least 14 days to get it back (minus 20% Fiverr fee), and if the order is canceled for some reason, not only you made 0, you actually lost money.

I’ve tried changing the extras to 10 for $5 in 1 day and 20 images for $15 in 3 days, but still encountered the same problem. I also tried clicking the “Extra Fast” delivery to see if it could be that but still the same problem.

Once you spend a bit more time on the forum, you’ll understand. Time after time after time we keep seeing people complaining that they got banned for no good reason, and then it turns out they broke the rules (which they either didn’t bother to read, or they found them inconvenient so they kept breaking them). And they keep arguing that there’s nothing wrong with what they did, just like you kept arguing for a while, because it’s easier for you to communicate via Discord.

So, I would like to ask my fellow sellers, would they like it seeing a calling option (both video and normal calls) apart from fiverr chat to communicate with their customers.

AGREED.
Perhaps since the platform is now copying Upwork with blind reviews, they will also follow suit by copying the process of the Seller having the power to elect whether or not they will work with a Buyer.
I have yet again cancelled another order where the crowned Buyer tried to bully me into providing free work by threatening to cancel the order. I will not work for free or be manipulated.
As a result, my gigs have all but disappeared from search results and listings – no fault of my own. Have I notified and reported the buyers to CS? Yes. Will they do anything about my cancellation rate and detrimental ranking? No.
You are right. It’s unfair and unjust.
If there is a silver lining, it is that I don’t end up lending my voice and good vibes to scammers. I assume that these petty thieves run their businesses and their lives in the same unscrupulous manner. Each of us reaps what we sow.
Best wishes with your business!

Fiverr should really work on this feature, A seller should be given an option to either accept/reject the order within 24 hours so as after going through the order requirements, a seller should make a final decision on that. After accepting an order, the timeline should start from that period only when a seller officially accept the order by clicking on that “button”. If the seller declines the order then it should not count in the cancelled stats because the seller has not accepted the order. An order number should be generated only after a seller officially accept the order.

It’s been asked for year after year by sellers left and right. It’s one of those obvious features that would have been implemented already if they had any plans to do so. I don’t know if they’ve ever made any official statements as to why they won’t implement it but it doesn’t seem to fit their business model.
They want to be seen as a place where someone can just click a button and get what they want. No muss, no fuss. So they don’t give you the power to reject orders and asking buyers to contact you before ordering is generally discouraged.
It probably became even less likely once really popular YouTubers made a “thing” out of buying gigs on Fiverr a year or so back and boosted the visibility of the platform. They all expected and showed the same experience: just going through and ordering things as if adding items to a shopping cart.
That’s what Fiverr wants to be even though it’s a model that conflicts with the core structure of freelance work. So you have to change how you freelance and do things that aren’t standard to fit their model because they certainly won’t change how they do things to fit ours.
It’s why the quick, “silly” things are a much better fit for Fiverr’s design, like sellers who offer singing happy birthday in a funny costume. It’s not like regular freelance work where you sit down and go over a brief with a client and timelines and drafts and the like. It’s just quick one-shot deals.
Anything more complex, you have to twist what you offer and how to make it work and there will still be problems because a lot of the kind of work done on here just wasn’t meant to be done this way with custom services being treated more like products on a shelf.",N/A,"Feb 28, 2019 9:12 am",2020-07-30 01:29:56.564865

Ah, if life were so simple. We should have ‘accept or reject’ buttons for everything we do. And people we have to meet!
Granted, the ‘reject’ button is the one we would use extensively, for there is much in the world that is more disagreeable than agreeable. And people top the list. I have no quibbles about animals, trees, rocks, and all else. I like these a lot more.
Accept that in this world, as Voltaire wrote, most people are not worth having anything to do with. The rest is the exception, not the rule. Never expect too much from other people. Little or nothing from them, is the rule.

Why? Well, pretty simple, my friend…SELLERS are EASIER to find. BUYERS are HARDER to find. Said another way: it is more common to find someone who sells something, than to find someone who actually buys it.
Therefore, it follows that sellers have MUCH less choice than BUYERS do. Buyers can choose a LOT more.

Of course. That’s how Fiverr works. If you keep cancelling orders, your orders completed percentage drops. This is a performance metric, and, since the search results are based upon performance, when your performance goes negative, you lose “ranking” in the search results.
If people keep placing orders for services you don’t offer, or with expectations for more work than your pricing structure, then the odds are strong that your problem is a poorly defined gig that might be confusing your buyers. If you want to cut down on cancellations, and improve your gig performance, you may need to tighten up the wording and explanations within your packages and gig descriptions.
Don’t blame your buyers for being “ridiculous”, when the repeated problem may actually be your own gigs, and how you’ve written them.",N/A,"Apr 20, 2019 11:49 pm",2020-07-30 01:30:03.353053

I want a fair price, so I’m trying to “contact me first” as they are asking me. I have had one polite hedge (“I’m busy this week”), which doesn’t help in the business world since my follow up about her starting next week was ignored, and one person who didn’t apparently read my last paragraph of my detailed inquiry, so I immediately responded, quoted myself from just above, and then clarified some more. One person who seemed to have the least command of my native language (based on his info page) I only gave one question plus answered the two questions he asked specifically (instead of my 2300 character standard inquiry) in his about the gig panel, which is sort of buried I might add… thanks to how fiverr decided to organize the web page.

Why? Because >>> 100% of sellers <<< I’ve reached out to have stated in their details “PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST!!!” That means… 100% of sellers in my usage of this site want this feature!
So, there is a fundamental flaw in the system. How has this service been going this long without honoring this basic need of the people who make fiverr money $?! (I’m assuming, not being a seller, that fiverr gets a decent piece of your pie sellers?)
The sellers AND the buyers need this feature so as not to >> waste everyone’s valuable time << (look at how they market their platform) that we could be using to earn and spend money doing and hiring for jobs! Ridiculous oversight! We’re all wasting our time while earning fiverr money.

IF the button exists, all buyers will cancel their orders while they wait.<
that’s not a logical argument. Some will, probably yes… because they signed up with someone who decided to add a step to this process that makes a lot of sense to a lot of people…
Maybe even make it auto-cancel after 2 days? This is a negotiation between two parties, why not treat it like that?
some people want this… some people don’t… what’s the problem with making it optional again? Showing that this option is in effect on the gig page? When someone buys a gig trigger a message “As you saw on the gig page, this seller chooses to filter jobs. There are many reasons for this, including accidentally selecting the wrong gig, spam, etc… Don’t worry, the seller will get back to you soon, but if they can’t, this order will auto-cancel after 2 days so you can take your money elsewhere” This is so painfully reasonable… anyone ever used ebay?
Imagine if there was a community gathering area, and you left a pile of your contracts for tree trimming there, and somebody left a pile of artwork contracts there…
Someone came by, grabbed a tree-trimming contract, then put in the job description of what they want you to do as “landscaping for a 2 acre plot, shrubs, weeds, vegetables.” Not a single tree to be trimmed in that entire description!
BUT, the community center hides your contracts in a dark corner if you don’t respond to all the people who have tried to hire you by completing the contract, even if they had no idea what they were doing…
Who thinks it’s fair to punish freelancers who regularly get people trying to hire them who can’t follow the basic directions of matching their job desired to a freelancer’s gig description?

Subject: Newborn Kitties! Come take ONE of the BABIES!
Body: Please come to my house and take one of these lovely new baby cats to a nice home.
Please don’t bother the mommy she is resting.
LISTING OPTION 1: here’s my address: xxxxxxxx
Listing option 2: Please let me know how many >babies< you can take, and I’ll text you the address.
Pretend craigslist only allowed option 1.
In listing option 1 someone just comes to your home and takes the mommy cat…
So, since this happened to you twice already, you decide to use listing option 2. But wait, you can’t…

They could design it so that the seller accepts the order before the buyer even pays money for the order. And if the seller doesn’t agree to the order, it will not affect the seller’s cancellation rate. This is not going to slow down the process (than it already is) in any way.
They can make it so that cancellation rates are only affected if the seller accepted the order and then canceled the order later on.
misscrystal:

It’s all in the buyer’s hands, really. Like I mentioned earlier, if the buyer is required to let the seller know the order details and get the seller’s acceptance even before the buyer is asked to pay for the order, it would make things a lot easier and faster.
It’s up to the buyer to decide how long they’re willing to wait for an acceptance from the seller. If the seller doesn’t respond in a reasonable amount of time, the buyer can just move on to another seller.
There’s no point in placing an order with a seller (expecting “FAST service”) only to have the seller cancel the order later on. If you think about it, this is what is going on right now on Fiverr. Buyers are not really receiving “FAST service” because sellers often have to cancel such orders where the buyer either ordered something the seller isn’t capable of doing or where the buyer’s order requirements are unclear and the buyer is not replying back to the seller’s messages.
In case of the above-mentioned examples, do you think a seller would worry about their order cancellation %? Nope. So, even with the current system that’s in place, buyers are not really receiving “fast service.”",N/A,"Jun 1, 2019 12:02 pm",2020-07-30 01:30:19.240203

All this is not how online sales work.
The first principle of online sales, just like mail order sales, is the speed from the time the buyer decides he wants it to the time he gets it.
This is the main reason people love to buy online. Speed of delivery. No delay between when the decision is made to buy and getting the item.
Sellers need to understand this and try to work within this driving principle.

hanshuber16:
What some people do not realize is that, even with the current system that’s in place, sellers are resorting to cancelling the orders anyway (in case of “problematic orders” where the buyer selected the wrong package or the buyer ordered something the seller is not capable of doing or if a non-responsive buyer placed an order with unclear requirements), and this means that buyers are not really receiving FAST service as they have to go looking for another seller once the current order gets canceled.

No it means he wants his order to go through as fast as possible and doesn’t mind when all the bugs in the system kick in and they all accept it and he has to go insane trying to get 11 orders cancelled.

It’s a nightmare even now. And if a new system has to be implemented on Fiverr, there’s obviously going to be a lot of (temporary) mayhem and confusion. This, however, shouldn’t be an impediment to the implementation of a better system that will benefit the platform/users of the platform in the long run.

There’s no way for you to try to win. Buyers who are not sensible are wreaking havoc on the current system. So, I don’t see how it’s going to be any different if they were to add an accept/decline button.
Besides, like I mentioned, the buyer will only have to pay for the order after sellers accept the request. So, even if 12 sellers accept the request, the buyer can then choose how many sellers he is going to work with based on the sellers he chooses to pay the order money for. So, this system will work even if Fiverr is completely filled with unreasonable buyers.
There’s definitely a way to implement such a system (with an accept/decline button) that works flawlessly. If you don’t see a way to make such a system work, I’m sorry.

We never accept orders without prior contact, and 95% of our clients have the sense to contact us first - those who don’t, are usually canceled to prevent further problems.

“Speed” is not at all important for us in the vast majority of cases. Nobody drops $1K+ on a video expecting it to be done in 2 days, and definitely not without a detailed phone chat before. For serious, professional freelance work this is simply a necessity - and I like to think that Fiverr, with initiatives like the Pro section, is trying to position itself as a professional freelance platform.
Thinking “if people can’t order fast or I have to accept then they’ll change their minds” just reveals that either I don’t believe in my product, or that the client doesn’t really need it. If I’m selling what people want, I’ll do fine. If I’m banking on “impulse buys”, maybe I need to re-examine my business model - why did this client want to order from me and then changed his mind? There must be a reason.
All in all, in my case, this button would mean a 0% cancelation rate, and 95% of my clients would notice no difference at all since I mostly send custom offers.

CONSIDER THIS:
Fiver makes money on the order commencing.
Fiverr also makes money on cancellations.
Fiver also makes money on Add-Ons – that’s right, if your Buyer would like to fund an Add-On then she/he will have to pay AN ADDITIONAL FEE on top of the cost of the Add-On. Even though the Buyer has already paid a fee for the original order, she/he will be charged AGAIN for any additions.
Seasoned Buyers know this,
and that’s why they START with a message to the Seller.
And that friends, is why it is highly important to encourage your potential Buyers to MESSAGE FIRST.
Advertise on your gig page that you are happy to write up a Custom Offer. This takes more time of course – but think about what a better experience it is when the Buyer and Seller are aligned in advance.
Happy Selling!",N/A,"Jun 5, 2019 11:04 am",2020-07-30 01:30:43.092594

Counter allows you to renegotiate the price and indicates to Fiverr that you see something off with the order and are trying to make amends with the buyer. “Hey, your script has X words, but you’re only paying for Y. The price for what you want is $N.”
It is then placed on the Buyer to Accept, Negotiate, or Cancel the order, not affecting your Cancellation rate.
If the Buyer gets too demanding or tries to get more after they’ve accepted your Counter, then you can Report to Fiverr that the Buyer’s expectations are out of line and they can review and cancel the order on their end if they agree with you.",N/A,"Jun 5, 2019 1:44 pm",2020-07-30 01:30:43.475341

It’s why the level system puts us in a bad situation. If we deliver, we might be punished with a bad review. If we refund, we’re punished with a lower order completion rate.
My suggestion would be to only do gigs where 99% of your buyers like your work, maybe 98% in some cases. If you have a gig that makes you a lot of money but 10 people out of 100 give you a bad review, that’s a dangerous gig.",N/A,"Jun 29, 2019 12:51 pm",2020-07-30 01:30:50.277322

I recognize that this site suggestion might stir the pot a bit, but I believe it’s an essential inclusion.
Delayed delivery
Immediately, you might be thinking “but quick turnaround times are an integral part of great customer service”
Exactly. I completely agree! That’s not the purpose of this feature.
Consider this: you’re working on a project. Midway through, you receive a message. To maintain a favorable response rate, you decide to pause on your current gig and respond. 10…20…30 minutes later, you find yourself still engaged in this on-and-off dialogue. In turn, your productivity has suffered.
This happens to me all the time, and I’m sure I’m not alone. At this point, you might say ""but why not just delay responding yourself after the initial response? You could, of course, but many type-A sellers want to have all of their ducks in a row before proceeding with existing work.
Enter, delayed responses
Set a response and continue working in peace for a set period of time.
Now, you might be wondering ""but what if they say something or ask something in between their last message and the delayed response?
Simple. Just state “in response to question X…” before scheduling the delay.
Okay! But why would delayed delivery (not just responses) ever be useful?
Consider the scenario where you’re well ahead of your queue and just got a revision request. Although hammering it out immediately means it’s off your plate, this can give the perception of quick or shotty work (even if you gave it your usual effort…)
By just delaying an hour, you’re still providing a fast turnaround time, but not as if you were rushing.
Another scenario is the classic revision-trigger-happy buyer that keeps asking for small modification after a small modification. This situation can seriously stifle your ability to stay productive on other projects. If you delay each revision, you can make progress on other gigs during the gaps.
I know this is likely to stir some debate, but I think having this feature is better than not! I’m attaching a poll below, looking forward to any feedback

, please stop copying and pasting this same text in multiple topics. There is nothing wrong with the search algorithm. Fiverr does not guarantee that any gigs will show up where the seller wants them to appear. Gigs rotate frequently. Your gig might be back near the top tomorrow… maybe in two weeks… perhaps even a month. Rotation is normal, and it allows the search results to stay fresh, and give everyone a chance to compete for visibility.",N/A,"May 14, 2020 4:08 pm",2020-07-30 01:31:58.208497

I’ll give you an example - I just checked my orders page and I have completed 13 orders for the last week just from repeat customers, but I am at the last page with the Best-selling filter applied, which is definitely not the case as I’ve been spectating and observing each gig on the first page. Most of the gigs are gigs without reviews, 1 5 star review for the last month or gigs with 4.3 star 10 total reviews. As for the gig rotation - you’re totally missing the point of how it works. The highest performance gigs are up there, the mid-tier gigs are tossed in the back a little to make room for new potential sellers and the low performance gigs are deranked. I always invest 150% of my energy in my work and that’s how I became a best-seller. I have been one for the last year, my stats were always 100% and my profile has a full 5 star rating estimated from almost 500 reviews. And yeah, you can send me the same robotic response about an issue that you’re not experiencing but I know for a fact that something’s not right because the math doesn’t work. 13 orders and 11 reviews for a week on a single gig and my gig is the last gig on the 5th and last page.

As for the gig rotation - you’re totally missing the point of how it works.
No, I don’t think I am. I’ve been here on Fiverr for more than six years. I am well aware of how things work. And the gig rotation doesn’t seem to be any different than it has been for quite some time. Just because your gig has entered the rotation, does not mean that anything is broken. Like I said, you may be on the last page now, but you could be in the middle, or even back at the top in a few weeks.
There is nothing broken. This is how the search system works.

No more than previous years. This is nothing new. And it’s not new, just because you are experiencing it now. It’s been rotating like this for years.

Something’s really off with the search results and the filters right now and I really hope that it gets fixed soon.
Hey
@worthforcheap
, I can understand your frustration and I know you probably feel worried about your gigs as I’ve been in the exact situation before. But, as
@jonbaas
has pointed out, the algorithm is working as it should. My gig gets blasted to end of the search results every now and again BUT it doesn’t really affect how many “Views” my gig is getting though impressions do go down considerably.
Just stay calm and focus on delivering the orders you do have. Since you do offer rap song lyrics I can tell why you’re struggling to get orders. People just aren’t in a comfortable enough place for services like this with the entire world going through what is possibly the worst recession since WWII.
As for the stats page, don’t expect it to be up anytime soon. They’re probably reworking the whole thing and will probably be active again a short while after Fiverr rolls out their new ad service.
With that said, Good Luck and I wish you the best. And just to clarify, as long as your gig is in search regardless of the page then it will bounce back given it has reasonable reviews and decent performance.",N/A,"May 14, 2020 10:26 pm",2020-07-30 01:32:06.491799

If this cannot be guaranteed by Fiverr and they want me to advertise my Gig through paid advertising out there, bringing traffic to this website with 50% probability of losing that traffic, sincerely I prefer to do it on my website. The fact that Fiverr does not care about sellers is related not to giving any incentive to sellers who are performing well. For me makes no sense. Really I don’t get. It’s the base of any contract/game theory, incentives to stay, or you lose the most important sellers here.

Gig rotation is a normal thing but what is happening to gigs nowadays is not normal as throwing all gigs from first pages to 3rd last pages for no reason makes no sense at all. If you are not performing well and your gigs are not in search results and going downward in ranking that makes sense and is understandable.
And yeah, Like
@bodmas
said, how can you say everything is fine?
bodmas:
You claim nothing is wrong with the algorithm… If anything is faulty with the algorithm, would you know? Or would you be informed by the Fiverr staff?
They said 50 sellers but I can bet more than 100 sellers who have been on Fiverr are facing the same issue.
My gigs were on very first pages as I worked on them and then suddenly they are now on 3rd last pages of search since December 2019 for no reason at all and that too when I search after applying 2-3 filters (Country and Seller Level).
If just a few numbers of people are complaining about a thing that means the issue is with just a few sellers and that must be from the seller side. But when a large number of sellers are complaining about this same issue then Fiverr at least should give a clue of what is happening and what to do in such a case.
It is going to be 6th month now that my gigs aren’t getting sales from any new buyer (thanks to some old buyers who keep coming).
And one more thing to mention here: Those sellers who are facing this issue, when they make a new gig, that too lands on the last pages where other gigs are. I’ve tried and tested that.",N/A,"May 16, 2020 11:28 pm",2020-07-30 01:32:11.105201

But when a large number of sellers are complaining about this same issue then Fiverr at least should give a clue of what is happening and what to do in such a case.
Fiverr is not going to release details on how the Fiverr search algorithm works, because the algorithm is proprietary software. It is not for public knowledge, because if it were, sellers would be able to manipulate the system in their favor. That would hurt Fiverr, and it would hurt what makes Fiverr the competitive services platform that it is.
I sympathize with you and others who don’t have the search visibility that you want, but Fiverr has said – many times – that the system is working as it is supposed to. If you ask them personally (via a message to CS), they’ll likely tell you exactly that. Fiverr does not guarantee search visibility to anyone. They’ve said this too. Therefore, there is no sense in complaining about something that is working properly, just because it isn’t working in your favor. Gig rotation is part of Fiverr’s chosen business model and operations policies. To ensure a fair market system, Fiverr has coded their algorithm to rotate. No one is guaranteed prime placement on the first place, no matter how long you’ve been on Fiverr, or how worthy you may feel that you are.
The algorithm mixes things up based upon factors we will never know. That is how Fiverr has designed it, and that is likely how it will remain. If your gig is not showing up where you want it to, then now might be a good time to start learning how to market and promote your gigs on your own. It is not Fiverr’s job to make sure you have orders. YOU are the freelancer offering your services here. YOU need to treat your gigs like a business, and, as any good businessman knows, marketing your own services to the people who need them is how business works.
The search system should NEVER be your only source of sales.",N/A,"May 16, 2020 11:41 pm",2020-07-30 01:32:11.506544

Does anyone help me?",N/A,1,"Jun 2, 2020 3:58 pm",charlesneneanya,2,"From my experience here, you all are absolutely correct. There is an issue with Fiverr’s algorithm that even CS is a little CLUELESS about or unfortunately as the case may be, CS may have been instructed to pacify all Sellers pending when a fix may be made (more like a system maintenance script). This actually started in August, 2019 following the launch of the Fiverr Pro Service. A lot of trial and error tactics disrupted the free flow of Fiverr. Before now, Fiverr Best Seller search worked on purely merit and rotation algorithm (Market forces of demand/supply, performance metrics) but now the search page works on irregular and irrational metrics. Before I deducted that in order to encourage the patronage of Fiverr Pro Sellers, all other senior sellers had to be hidden from the search page (taken to the last page) so that new buyers will find it extremely difficult to find them and end up patronizing the Fiverr Pro Sellers as against buying from inexperienced new sellers with 1 to 10 ratings. Unfortunately, Fiverr’s revenue is expected to drop going by my economics as a business plan writer that quantity not only brings many more buyers to Fiverr who will consistently patronize the platform thereby encouraging a free flow of revenue but also jobs and free advertisement for Fiverr that Quality that brings in onetime high paying clients once in a while with the delivery not being far better than the regular senior sellers whom have been tested and trusted on Fiverr through their reputation build up.
Over all, everyone should relax. Let the market forces play. Get your complaints recorded with CS as I believe there are metrics Fiverr management staff use to judge current problems of their marketplace. If we do not get jobs, Fiverr revenue will drop and there will be a comparison or evaluation on the success or failure of their new algorithm compared to the older and more efficient algorithm. Whatever happens, just like Instagram, Facebook and other Social Medias, Fiverr only gives you the platform to sell your service (you do not need to own your websites) get your customers from whatever means possible and prove to them you are a professional via your Fiverr page, record the sales on Fiverr and grow your public image worldwide.",N/A,"May 31, 2020 1:51 pm",2020-07-30 01:32:12.673032

It is only when one’s gigs are thrown to the last pages that is when they realize that the last pages exist. I joined Fiverr in 2017 and in 2018 I rose to the first page through a gradual process from page 10 to 8, 7, 6, 5, 6, 4, 5, 4, 3,4,3,2,2,1,1,1 for one year plus I was constantly on the first search page till I was taken to the last page in September 17th. From then till date, my gigs are still on the last page where I hardly get orders.
I frequently complained to CS but to no avail then I gave up. Once in a while I get repeat buyers orders. Fiverr algorithm caused a major decline in my revenue but that is not the end of life, Fiverr will maybe not today bring my gigs back to page 1 but I believe one day I will be rotated back to page 1 to 10 which is good enough to pick up my many sales.

Fiverr is not going to release details on how the Fiverr search algorithm works, because the algorithm is proprietary software.
True everything the algorithm takes into account is proprietary, though Fiverr have publicly said in an interview that:
We didn’t build a search engine entirely from scratch, but we’re leveraging solar
and elastic and using them in a way that is slightly different than other companies
I think they mean Solr search and ElasticSearch (Wikipedia says both of those are open source).
They also give more info on how the search engine worked (at least in 2017) in the link below (like that at that time being “online” was one factor in ranking) which is where the quote is from (see page 14):

Do you know what impressions are?
In order for this to be possible, your gig must be inactive. Impressions are just when your gig shows up on a page in search. People don’t have to click on your gig for you to gain an impression.
I cant post a buyer request
Buyer requests are for buyers to post their projects, which sellers then respond to offering their services. You can’t post a new request unless you’re in ‘buying’ mode. There is a button specifically for switching modes and it’s at the top of every Fiverr page when you’re logged in.

While your written English is actually very good, it is also far from native - which is what you claim in your profile.
You will therefore find that true native English speakers / writers are unlikely to use you as they can see and sense that something isn’t quite right.
Also, and I don’t necessarily agree with this although it is reality, anyone looking for an English based skill is likely to turn to US and British sellers.
Therefore the problem isn’t with Fiverr as a platform. The problem, I would suggest, is that your gigs aren’t quite up to the standard required for the services you are advertising.
It’s very easy to blame someone else. But it’s often wiser to look closer to home for the answer.",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:08 pm",2020-07-30 01:32:23.662562

(EDIT: This only works if you have everything you need to set up the gig in one sitting. You CANNOT go back and edit a partially-complete gig - see moments at bottom.) This morning I went in as usual and nothing worked. But then I tried this, and I have been able to get to page 3 of setting up a new voiceover gig:
use Chrome
clear cache
set up a new gig (don’t try editing an old one)
try saving a few times on page 1 to trigger error messages on mandatory fields
on page 2, do the same - save when you first arrive on the page and all the fields should turn red - then start filling only those in (saving occasionally) - I was finally able to go to page 3
From page 3, I could then go back to page 2 and add the optional gig extras, etc, and save successfully.
Good luck everyone. (And if anyone in IT is monitoring this, please fix this bug!)

Apologies if this has been suggested before, though I can’t find it, but I was wondering whether it might be a cool/helpful feature to let us make a custom signature template that automatically applies to our messages to buyers/sellers? I’m thinking it could work like it does on Outlook, where you can have multiple different signatures and then choose which one to apply in your message as default.
It wouldn’t be a groundbreaking feature - it’d just save me having to manually type “Kind regards, David” at the end of every single message. And yes, I get that I don’t have to leave a signature, but I like to do it to keep an air of professionalism with my messages, so being able to have one automatically apply would just save me maybe 5 seconds of my life with each message. And I mean each message - not just new/first enquiries.
It would also be handy if you could make multiple templates/signatures depending on, for example, if you were going on holiday. Like, if you were on holiday but still responding to messages on the app (to keep your response rate up) it’d save you a lot of time and hassle if you didn’t have to type something to the effect of “Please be aware I am currently on holiday between the x of y and the x of y so I am unable to take on any extra work, but I will get back to you blah blah blah” every single time you get a new message. Or if it was around Christmas you could have a Christmas specific one.

Suggestion: Change how the Average Response Time is calculated/displayed,"Fiverr Site

A problem with it as it is is that a seller in a country in a timezone very different to that where the country/countries with the most buyers are could end up with quite a high response time if it’s sent out of the seller’s normal working hours (eg. 1 or 3 AM their time). Especially if multiple messages are sent around then and few from potential buyers in their own timezone recently. A high response time could then lead to fewer orders/messages sent to that seller, including from people from their own country/close timezone (eg. the average response time shown could be a lot higher than the actual response time if that potential buyer seeing it sent a message).
What might make the response time fairer for sellers is to make any messages outside normal hours for the seller (eg. Normal office hours) be excluded from the response time calculation (like someone thought it used to be), as well as to show that to the buyer somewhere.
Store Multiple Average Response Times for each Seller option
Another option would be to store multiple average response times – ones for different times during the day. eg. Split the 24 hour day into about 4 periods (so 4 six hour periods), and store an average response time for each of the 6 hour periods, eg. 00:00 to 06:00 for 1st average, 06:00:01 to 12:00 for second avg etc. There could be more periods (averages) stored if more accuracy was required. It could still be based on the last 60 days (or it could be changed to eg. 90 days if there were not enough messages in each of the 6 hour periods).
Doing it the above way could show a more accurate average (or expected) response time to the potential buyer based on the current time at the seller’s location. If there are times with a quicker average response time than the current one, maybe it could indicate that to the buyer on the seller’s profile or when you hover over the response time/click on it or click to send a message.",N/A,N/A,N/A,parvesislam_efn,1,"You said very well, I agree with you, we should talk about this",N/A,"Jul 17, 2020 1:34 pm",2020-07-30 01:35:07.409213

With the new changes Fiverr made, when I open the dashboard of course, by default “All Orders” are selected to display.
And that sounds good, but instead I am flooded with all those incomplete orders from years ago




If I select the Active Orders, then the Late and In Revision orders are not there. So It is leaving me with no other option but to NOT use the dashboard, but to see all sales in the Manage Sales area, when you sort them by Priority it gives you all orders: Late, Active, In Revision, etc. It is not ideal because it doesn’t give you an hourly deadline if you have more than 24 hours to deliver, but it will have to do for now.
I am sure that Fiverr is willing on making the Dashboard better, but unfortunately this is a rather step back and it only causes confusion to people who have a large number of incomplete orders from years ago, like me. So I really hope that a solution will be implemented so that we as well can benefit from it.

If I select the Active Orders, then the Late and In Revision orders are not there. So It is leaving me with no other option but to NOT use the dashboard, but to see all sales in the Manage Sales area, when you sort them by Priority it gives you all orders: Late, Active, In Revision, etc. It is not ideal because it doesn’t give you an hourly deadline if you have more than 24 hours to deliver, but it will have to do for now.
I am sure that Fiverr is willing on making the Dashboard better, but unfortunately this is a rather step back and it only causes confusion to people who have a large number of incomplete orders from years ago, like me. So I really hope that a solution will be implemented so that we as well can benefit from it.

https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/order-status 1
In the Incomplete section it says:
Note: After a week has passed from the original date of the order creation, a seller can cancel the order without any harm to their cancellation ratio or ratings.
So you could try cancelling one that is years old and see if it affects the stats (eg. wait until after it cancels or preferably a day after that - if the stats are only updated once a day) - you could try that if cancelling one order won’t have too much effect on your stats (but it shouldn’t have any I think). If it doesn’t affect it you could cancel others that are also old enough (eg. any > a week old and in the “incomplete” status might be okay to cancel now).
So cancelling them could then make viewing the dashboard easier to see the actual active (new) orders without a change to the dashboard.",N/A,"Jul 12, 2020 3:39 pm",2020-07-30 01:35:24.228599

Anyone has had the same problem ?",N/A,N/A,N/A,crisnelyn,0,"Hi guys,
I want to update you on how I didn’t receive any support from the Fiverr customer service, I received a useless email from Sam of the customer service asking me for my 3 Paypal transactions ID and he said that the error is because of my bank.
I saw many people got this problems, so far I have 0 refund and a customer service that is not reading what I wrote.
I mentioned that I tried to pay twice using the credit card method but I got a message saying the transaction has failed please try again.
Afterwards I tried to pay with my credit card using the Paypal method and it worked.
Now the Fiverr customer service is asking for 3 transactions ID… how can I get them.
And they said that it’s because of my bank the payment has failed.
In the meantime I still have my 3 payments charged by Fiverr.",N/A,"Apr 14, 2017 3:55 am",2020-07-30 01:36:57.745645

I scanned my passport in very HQ and took a selfie then i submitted them , when i refreshed i got that we couldn’t verify your id , that’s why i submitted them again !, i immediately got restricted and my account was temporarily disabled , ( i think it’s because i upload my passport twice )

the problem I face is that with the gig packages and the multiples people can book for example 50K words and the delivery time won´t go up and I´d have to deliver within 7 days, which would be a bit inconvenient…
People don´t read, and they can God knows how many gig multiples, I stopped trying how high I could go when I was over 100.
Will adding gig multiples as extras prevent that the multiples can be clicked? I’ll try and do that then, I´m still not sure why I shouldn´t be allowed to limit the multiples for my gigs, but if that´s a workaround I´ll take it!
Thank you.
Mila
edit: I don´t think it helps, I might have to go back to the non package set-up, there I could control this ‘issue’ with the extras, as I then could set additional time for additional words.
Hm, this doesn´t work with my package set-up, the extras are for all 3 packages, can´t make them different per package. Okay, I fear that means back to the one gig set-up, or take the risk of having to cancel orders.",N/A,"Feb 4, 2017 3:44 pm",2020-07-30 01:37:59.239112

I see, thanks anyway, it was worth a try, because I had found a way around uncontrollable gig multiplication by clicking against my written pleas with the non-package set-up that way, alas, well.
FAQs and PDF is in theory a good idea, but the thing is I have on all 3 packages, where everyone who´d click any of them would have to see it, to please read the gig description, where this point is addressed, and I fear 1.) people who don´t read the description, won´t read a PDF either, and 2.) don´t really want to put PDFs up because the poor people who would read, have to read more then, and while certainly good and needed for some gigs.
And I had more FAQs, but already deleted some of them a while ago, because the more there are, the less the chance that they get read, especially by the buyers who should read them, a lot of buyers message anyway of course if they have big work like ebooks, but, well, sometimes when I´m already booked out and yet wouldn´t have to pause a gig because I could take on small jobs, only not bigger ones, there´s that risk,and a lot is not all…
I also don´t think most of my gigs/offers need a big explanation, those that need ‘talking’ need talking anyhow more than a PDF (I´m wondering about restructuring my gigs/splitting/specialising them more though and for that maybe the PDF approach will be good to keep in mind).
I did change the overlay text on my gig images also to that effect, in the hope some people who don´t read the desctiption will look at the pics, maybe I´ll try to work on that and the wording of the gig description to make it clearer, but, well, the simple ‘limit allowed gig multiples’ would make this a lot easier and DAU-safe too.
Thanks for the joking though and the suggestions, I´ll mull over it all and in either case I´ll add my question there and ask for the transcripts at that opportunity too!

I had 2 cancellations now within short time because a buyer accidentally ordered a much higher gig multiple than they needed. So obviously they asked for a cancellation to reorder the right amount.
If i could choose how many gig multiples were possible to select with my gig, these 2 accidental orders and cancellations wouldn’t have happened, because for high word-counts which usually only would happen by mistake without inbox message and only ever happen per custom order really in my case, a buyer will have to contact me either way to make sure I even can do the order in the required time frame. There is absolutely no need and sense for my gigs to be able to be chosen in multiples like 10 or 20 or 50 or even more.
The only thing that can come of that option are cancellations because either a buyer clicks 10x the amount they want by accident or because a buyer would order something like 20K or 200K words without talking to me first and I might have to cancel it depending on my schedule.
Please let us sellers decide how many multiples of a gig a buyer can book ourselves, or at least give us a choice like 1-10 /1-20…unlimited, so it doesn’t unduly put those of us at a disadvantage who offer unique and custom and time intensive gigs.
There’s a huge difference in what amount you can deliver depending on the gig. I could probably send out 100 or even 1000 premade or mainly premade things like a PDF or a postcard from wherever within 3 days, but there’s a limit to how many words I can translate in 3 days, no matter how much coffee I drink and how little i sleep.

Well, as you know but he as a Buyer of course not necessarily, I still had to deliver within the 13 or so hours left after waking up to the order, or spend time on messaging and asking for an extension (with maybe consequences for secret rates and ranking ;)) and to risk it running late.
Well, that hopefully Dorstone happen often and I explained it to the buyer with a Screenshot of the multiple thing, but that other problem cost me 2 mutual cancellations and thus a good drop in cancellation rate already.

You can offer additional words or write it in your description in bold and highlighted, but still if they want to buy multiples, they can, and you can’t really even say it’s their fault, they should know you can’t simply order 10K words in 1 day if the seller offers 1K with 1-day delivery, or whatever, because if the drop-downs are there, why shouldn’t they use them (some people just have no idea of what is possible to manually do in a day, others don’t care, or maybe think you work as a team, …) … as a seller, you can only fulfill the order, if even humanly possible, or cancel.
And since Fiverr most apparently doesn’t want us to cancel even if there’s an absolutely good reason to, since their cancellation policy change and level evaluation implementation, they should take care of such clear gaps in the system.
I don’t quite understand where the problem is there, either - the lower your level, the less multiples a buyer can click… so, it’s definitely possible technically to limit the multiples, that’s as if it is a punishment actually for having a higher level than it being one of the perks… being able to set our own number of multiples, that would be a perk.
Where’s the incentive for a buyer to order a faster delivery extra, too, if they can just order however many multiples they want to get a big amount of text done within a delivery time that only is meant for much less text. It doesn’t make any sense, no matter from which side I look at it. You’re at the mercy of buyers who are aware of how long something needs and sensible enough to contact you instead of simply clicking on what’s clickable, respectively you’re at risk of this system gap being exploited by those who’d do such on purpose.",N/A,"Jun 25, 2018 10:56 am",2020-07-30 01:38:06.728836

Hi Jane! I’m sorry to know you’re going through this.
Sadly, you will find people blithely telling you to set Gig multiples instead of packages, but the truth is that this is the worst option for a large number of categories or sellers - especially for writers, translators and proofreaders.
For sellers like us who belong to the writing category, and corresponding subcategories, choosing to offer Gig multiples is asking for trouble, since our work time – and, hence, the delivery time - strictly depends on the amount of words we’re working with. So, unless you offer a very low word count (and I mean a really low word count), setting Gig multiples is never a good idea.
If my advice could be of any help, I would suggest you to consider offering packages. Try to set them in such a way that buyers will be discouraged to order your 1-day delivery package for files with a high word count.",N/A,"May 2, 2020 2:44 pm",2020-07-30 01:38:13.429688

If my advice could be of any help, I would suggest you to consider offering packages. Try to set them in such a way that buyers will be discouraged to order your 1-day delivery package for files with a high word count.
I did use to have the 3-package set-up, but that basically came down to the exact same rate per word, just a bigger word count. Another regular user on the forums told me to abolish that, so hearing this is a bit confusing. Should I go back to the same tactic?
I ended up messaging the guy twice, opening a dispute, and sending a message to CS. 24 hours ago, he accepted the dispute to give me more time, but he still hasn’t said a single word to me or delivered the needed files. CS hasn’t responded yet either, buy I hope they will sometime in the next 23 hours.
If only we could turn off gig multiples, or turn off the ability to attach files… I have now added an extra Gig requirement asking if people have put the GDoc link in instead of another file, just to drive the point home in case they didn’t read the gig description, FAQ, or first requirement.",N/A,"May 2, 2020 6:38 pm",2020-07-30 01:38:13.835704

Yes, Jane. You should go back to offering packages unless you want to see yourself again in such a mess.
You can play with maximum word count, price, delivery time, and whatever other options Fiverr allows you, for each package. No three packages must be the same if you don’t want.
Also, on the edit mode, under “Pricing” and just below the packages, there’s an extra words option for each package (“Add Extra Services”). Set it in such a way that it will always be cheaper to choose the following package.

This is not something easy to solve. The problem here is that seldom buyers work with GDocs, so you will have to change the wording and really, really make it super clear that you don’t work with any other type of files.
For those who do work with GDocs, guide them into reading your FAQ where they will find the methodology, including the need of attaching the GDoc link. This, since most buyers don’t even bother to read all the gig description, including FAQ.",N/A,"May 2, 2020 7:40 pm",2020-07-30 01:38:14.254246

the delivery time doesn’t increase with the amount of multiples someone orders/
sellers can’t set their own number of possible gig multiples.
At least one of this really should be in place, as simple logic tells; both would be ideal, then sellers could choose the optimal set-up for their offerings.
I’ve just had it again the other day, someone ordered 3x the basic gig which includes 24-hour delivery. The time should have simply gone up to 3 days in that case, with a banner that makes the customer aware of it before they actually order, for all I care, in case it’s not obvious to someone that 3x the words might take 3x the time.
The buyer in this case even wrote “it doesn’t have to be 1 day”, only it has, because of this thinking/programming flaw, or I’d have had to send a time extension request - which costs me additional time, also might count against us for all we know, and nerves, as I can’t know whether or not the buyer will see and accept the request on time, might need me to rearrange my schedule but I can’t while I don’t know if they’ll accept the request on time or not, …
The really obvious and simple solution to keep things as automated and quick as possible (which is goals for Fiverr, too, as we know) is that the delivery time multiplies in line with the ordered gig multiples.
If someone wants to order 3x the words of the basic 1-day delivery gig, they have to either choose the “next tier” which would be 5x the words and have a higher delivery time “built in”, or to contact the seller to ask whether they even can deliver 3x the amount of words the basic gig offers, at this time, if yes, fine, if no, the seller can offer a custom offer with 2 or 3 days, whatever is possible.
Or, very simple, let sellers set their own number for gig multiples, starting from 0, then they can set up their gig packages effectively and according to what they (can) offer, and such things can’t happen.
Sellers who just click a few buttons, or are super fast or offer such “small things” that can each be done in a minute or two, can then set the gig multiples to 10, 100, or 1000 for all I care, and those who actually need time to do their job, can set up their gigs so that they aren’t stuck between Scylla and Charybdis, when looking at their options when someone books too many multiples.
/rant over, but it’s still a suggestion. There is no logic in how it currently is; it should be at the least so that either the delivery time automatically increases with multiples, or that sellers can set their own gig multiple limit, ideally both.",N/A,"May 6, 2020 5:47 am",2020-07-30 01:38:15.498316

On my end, I’ve turned on the gig packages again, and it seems to have removed the multiple option. Now I just have to pray buyers notice the ‘example’ and the ‘please message me’.
Nope. Just as Miiila, and because you haven’t added the word count option (“Add Extra Services”) to your the packages, you still get the Gig multiple after selecting any of them. Only setting the word count option will disable Gig multiples.
I selected your basic package to show you that it still shows up when buying.
Take a look to my proofreading packages (I haven’t modified them yet, but as soon as Fiverr clears the bug that’s currently affecting the site, I will.). For the example below, I chose a word count of 6500 words, and after selecting the package to buy, Gig multiple doesn’t appear as an option for the buyer.
Yes, I would have to work all day proofreading 6500 words if anyone decides to order the basic package for that amount of words, but the buyer would have to pay 8 times more and not 5 (4 times doesn’t reach the word count: 1500 x 4 = 6000). While with the premium package, the buyer would only be paying 5 times, just needing to wait another day (2-day delivery time).

There is also the related issue that if you want to offer some extra, the price for that extra will be billed only once and not according to how many multiples a buyer chooses, which also makes no sense. Say you offer writing an article of 1000 words and proofreading as an extra for $X, then if someone orders 2000 words and the proofreading extra, they’ll only pay the proofreading for 1000 words but you need to do it for 2000 words. No logic behind that.
Sellers are held back from offering more/faster/better if they have too little control over these things for no apparent reason and need to constantly think “oh I can only offer a small number of words in this gig, because what if someone orders more than I can do in x time” and so on.
Well, this forum category is for suggesting such ideas and supposedly is monitored. If you send ideas to support, they say “We’ve forwarded it to the relevant team” (which probably is the same team that monitors this category). It also makes more sense to have this forum category for that, so they won’t constantly get loads of suggestions for the same thing by lots of different people but can look through the suggestions and take on board what is feasible and disregard what is not.
It would be great, if the people who monitor this category could briefly comment on suggestions (at least on the ones that aren’t outrageous and make a lot of sense) and say “sorry, won’t/can’t happen (because)”, or “yeah, (on top of) our list, as soon as we can”, or something.

Again they can be fined (for example fiverr can make it mandatory to sign up with a card so they can charge if account has no balance ) If they make no sales it’s never going to matter.

Because you have given only two options directly.
1.Banned 2. Not be banned
I disagree with this options because everybody should have a chance to correction their mistake. And also can not guaranty them that no scammers is belonging with them.
Fiverr is removing and warning on copyrighted gigs.
After multiple warning automatically they become ban. I think this system is working correctly and it is perfect.
misscrystal:

Absolutely I agree with you. They have not ability to make their own gigs.
But it is not proved that they will not be able to make their own gig ever. They must need to learn more about work. In future they will become good seller after learning ( but very few scammers will remain forever among both seller and buyer).
Every body goes through learning process.

However, I don’t think fiverr will implement this step, since it’s difficult to identify the duplicate one. But, if there is clear identification mark, like you mentioned, that seller who copied your gig images, has still your name on his gig. In this case CS can decide on who is the duplicator.

I’m totally agree with hk_wordpress .Some beginners are not able to create their own content or they have no idea how to write a attractive and more selling content. So as they move further and learn something they could improve their gigs.
By totally agreeing, you are only demonstrating that you and
@hk_wordpress
have zero respect for people who get ahead without resorting to fraud or theft.
The simple fact is that stealing a gig description is not something you do by accident. If you have the brains to look up who is selling well in your category and copy and paste their description, you are not someone who needs sympathy.

I totally agree with this. I had one of my descriptions copied from someone who was trying to sell the exactly same services that I’m selling. The problem was that the seller was from other country and he was not even able to speak the language.

Regular",11,"That is never going to happen. Some buyers do not wish to leave a review, and that is completely fine.
Besides, you should be happy that Fiverr buyers are much more likely to leave reviews than buyers on other platforms online. My Rated Orders % is 53%, and I know that this is lower than what many other sellers here have (Maybe that is because I have never even alluded to reviews or feedback when I deliver, as I strictly adhere to the ToS).
I think 53% is extremely high compared to other online selling platforms. I will use the example of Steam as I sell games on there and know the platform well. Reviews are extremely important on Steam, almost as much as on Fiverr. But, on Steam, you will be lucky if 0.2% of your buyers leave a review. So, I think you should be very thankful that a large percentage of Fiverr buyers take time out of their day to leave a review for you.

Hey, look who’s back stirring things up yet once again.
I thought I remembered
@hassannawaz0303
!
I also do not think reviews should be compulsory. I have friends who are buyers. One used to leave the most glowing reviews—she is a writer, no wonder they were well written. However, she stopped leaving reviews when Fiverr started posing reviews on buyer’s pages.
There were two or three reasons she did so. But the most significant one was that she valued her privacy and did not want others to know what she was ordering.
I have never asked for a review. I am, however, known for my friendly, polite demeanor and fantastic proofreading services. Therefore, my buyers have left me reviews 82% of the time.
I agree with
@catwriter

However, it’s good to keep in mind that some buyers simply don’t like to leave reviews. They might be 100% satisfied with your work, but it’s just not in their habits to leave feedback. This could be for many different reasons. Some customer value their privacy and don’t want other people to see their purchases. Some other clients are just too busy and don’t want to “waste time”. Others simply forget about it. Who knows?
The thing is, if reviews were compulsory, a considerable proportion of customer would be less willing to buy on Fiverr.",N/A,"Jul 10, 2020 1:14 pm",2020-07-30 01:43:27.902881

I have mentioned earlier that if someone has enough time to place an order, ask for a revision and indulge into an argument , then he/she must have time for typing “good experience” (which takes less than 10 seconds type). Actually the thing is that all of us i.e Buyers/sellers, Forum members, affiliates etc altogether make Fiverr great .
We should learn how to value the person who gave us a good experience (when it comes to orders) by giving good reviews especially when you know how important one review can be for someone
Imagine you are a newbie and you got your first order which you completed with hardwork and dedication and all you wanted was a review to take your gig higher, but Alas due to the strict policies you can’t even ask for one. Also buyer choose not to give a review despite having a good experience. This would not feel so great when you are a seller in such a position",N/A,"Jul 10, 2020 1:22 pm",2020-07-30 01:43:28.336387

is giving a review this much difficult?
Have you ever placed an order on Fiverr to see the process? I am a buyer and a seller here. When I buy I am asked at two different times throughout the order process to leave a review. On top of that, I am told, “Tipping your seller is customary.”
As a seller, I am embarrassed Fiverr does this on my behalf because, no, I do not expect a tip. Plus one reminder to review is plenty. in my estimation.
So, not only is completing an order time-consuming. all of the review and tip requests are annoying. Yet, I still have many clients who do not generally leave reviews frequently stop by my inbox and leave a “thanks for the great work” message.

i’m agree with you it also happened with me. I don’t think money is everything. I’m doing a lot of hard work for his job but he didn’t give me review.How do I know if he is satisfied with my work?I will be motivated by one of his reviews. Isn’t that so?
Usually, customers who are satisfied but don’t want to leave a review, will simply say that they are, or, if they aren’t the kind that likes to talk much, they’ll come and buy again. For example, I have a regular customer since years, who used to leave reviews but eventually stopped, maybe he just got bored of writing the same over and over again, who knows, it’s fine, though, he still thanks me for my good work in chat, and keeps coming back, I know he’s happy.
Sure, it would be even better for me if he not just came back to order constantly but still left a review every time he orders, but well, it’s not worth dwelling on. Some people keep reviewing, every single order, and that’s great, often, I think it’s people who know themselves just how important reviews are because they have some kind of business that also thrives with reviews.
If you’re in a niche where repeat and regular customers are a rarer species, I guess it can be more difficult. However, most buyers certainly take advantage of being able to check out seller reviews themselves and thus are aware that it’s generally a good idea to leave a review, because that’s what enables them as well to pick a seller based on their reviews, so if they don’t leave a review, they probably have a reason for it.
It might just be that they don’t even want to waste a few seconds of their life on the mundane task of typing a review, it might be that they don’t want to “expose” their not that great English in public, or that they are a reseller, or don’t want anyone to know that their company buys on Fiverr, or even that they weren’t blown away by your work but don’t want to harm your rating stats by marring it with a 3* or whatever rating.
In any case, buyers who really like your work, probably will say so, if in a review, or in chat, or by buying again, and it would be a really weird move by Fiverr to try and start to force buyers to leave reviews.",N/A,"Jul 10, 2020 1:56 pm",2020-07-30 01:43:35.576485

I think you are right in saying that.
Of course we should learn to value the person who provides us a great service . Even more so, when we receive excellent customer service throughout the process. Personally speaking, I am always happy when I receive a customer review.
What I am trying to say is that - as a whole - Fiverr would be negatively affected by it in terms of collective revenues.

Regular",4,"So you think I am unprofessional?
I have had many wonderful experiences with sellers on Fiverr, but around Summer 2019 I started to run into a lot of sellers (some new sellers, some with over 100 reviews) who promised many beautiful things during the initial conversation. Then they started extending the order deadline (which is okay), but when they couldn’t keep the new deadline either, they started to make more excuses. Stringing me along for as long as they could, when they very well knew that they did not have the skills necessary to complete the job. Some of them even managed to keep this going for months, as I am very naive sometimes and likely to believe a person has good intentions rather than malicious ones. It annoyed me greatly that I wasted so much time during those months that I stopped spending money on Fiverr for a long time.
So, yes, I have started to find sellers on the forum instead. Sellers who post competently on the forum generally take their gigs more seriously, and, therefore, they are more likely to know what they are doing and deliver what they promise.
Large companies such as McDonald’s, Sony, Google, and so on are constantly judged by what they post on social media. And, guess what: So are you as a seller on Fiverr! You are your own brand!",N/A,"Jul 10, 2020 2:47 pm",2020-07-30 01:43:39.147525

It’s not judgmental, its a fact. New sellers don’t have experience so in this case what you suggest is a terrible idea simply based on you not understanding the review process, how it works and what motivates buyers to leave reviews.
The fact that you can’t accept this or understand it doesn’t help.
We have been in this situation time after time, where someone comes along who is new and rather than accept that maybe their suggestion was bad based on being new and not realizing some things, they continue on and on forever, unable to accept that.
