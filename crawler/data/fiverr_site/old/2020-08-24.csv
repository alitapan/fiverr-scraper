I’m new to Fiverr but to me it just seems really concerning that a bug like this has been around this long without a fix. Makes me wonder if this platform is going to be reliable to do business on.
EDIT: Customer support contacted me back about this. The issue was because I didn’t have a phone number listed on my account and my account needed to be verified with the phone number. Anyone else having this issue, try going to your settings and verifying your phone number and see if the issue persists. It worked for me. Funny though how there was no error message or anything stating that needed to be done in order to publish my gig. I was able to publish two other gigs previously without the issue.

My suggestion is adding in terms of service that deep fake voice construction (reusing someone’s voice) without their consent is not permitted.

Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence technology that superimposes the movements and words of one person onto another. While there are many legitimate applications of this technology, including mainstream filmmaking, deepfakes can also make it harder to combat the spread of disinformation and potentially easier to dismiss real events as fake. We monitor deepfake activity closely and will review reported cases on an individual basis.

Also, many buyers and sellers with questionable accounts and claim to be US citizens will soon be losing their accounts due to Fiverr’s new requirement that they prove they are US citizens by submitting a W9 tax form with their Social Security number on it.

Because what, in theory, should be happening is that we get lots of regular customers which means we’re not so dependent on the search results.
However, I know I’ve been through fallow periods too. At first I panicked, and changed lots of things in my gig - profile description, gig description, tags. You name it and I definitely changed it. I had a very slack period before Christmas - horrible - and I had to tighten my belt. Then things changed and got better in January. So, what I’d say is that just tickle your gigs, maybe polish them a bit, get your friendly local proofreader (me) to check them for you and make sure your images are professional and your tags are likely to work.

Your Fiverr Experience
You have been working on fiverr for a very Long time with your gig usually being very high on the search list and suddenly, some OTHER new persons gig comes in and pushes your gig to the last page.(Not trying to be rude in anyway but it’s unfair how people have been on fiverr for so Long with a well maintained gig suddenly being pushed down by a new guy with no orders or barely any click and impressions. poll

Conversations
There are about 15 posts a day from sellers (mostly new) who are saying they cannot find their gigs in search. I did a little experiment with my own gigs and found something out. You can search your gig and find it at the bottom then the next search can find it at the top. Gigs can disappear. One time I searched my gig and filtered it down to find it easier. It was nowhere to be found. I tried again 10 minutes later with the same filters and it was in the middle. “Ranking” doesn’t matt…

I am from Guyana and i have been directing thousands of individuals towards fiverr.
I only recently had complaints from many persons about the same issues.
#1 the area code for Guyana is 592 fiverr currently has 595
This would make it impossible for them to verify…
The next thing is more scary
#2 Every time someone complains about it the disable the account.
This is a very unfair business practice…
It is called discrimination…
Very Sad that fiverr a company that for the last three years I have sent so many persons too is doing this to the persons that help build their network. Which btw is getting very slow as of late.
I am hoping that they fix this issue as I will start redirecting persons from my network which now has over 200,000 people in it. most of which are Freelancers on the international market place.
FIX IT Please as it will be viewed as discrimination against third world countries. Thank You…",N/A,"Mar 29, 2017 4:41 pm",2020-08-24 10:15:58.864501

The best characteristic on my case is that I already made the verification when I registered, several months ago, and now that I am selling my gigs and want to withdraw they request this verification thing The SMS never comes, and if you try to make the verification through QR Code it is the same shit. The redirect you to a login page and when you try to login they don’t recognise your password.
After several attempts you try to reset password. NO, wrong Answer, they want the sms verification code to change password. and if you are alrteady loged in they just send you to homepage.
With few wordsa TOTAL MESS and no any solution.
I contacted the support and she sais “Clean cockies”. Hell no. I can clean cookies al day, I can open a cookie cleaning company if you want but as long as the SMS doesn’t come to my mobile I want be able to verify this f****** profile.
For sure for all the clients that comes from fiverr I will surely suggest them direct payment by offering a huge first payment discount!

Understanding Response Time & Response Rate
Responsiveness refers to the tracking of a Fiverr seller’s response rate (what percentage of inbox messages you reply to within twenty four hours) as well as your response time (how quickly you respond to a new request in your inbox). Replying within 24 hours is necessary for your response to be tracked. Response time is based on the last 60 days of a seller’s activity and tracks the amount of time it takes for a seller to respond when first contacted by a user.
Inbox messages and orders are different topic.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 8:32 am",2020-08-24 10:17:09.405869

Though really if some are wrong (I think someone else said on the forum their response time was a lot of days and CS fixed it), surely Fiverr could run a fix on all the response times and fix any bug.

You and such sellers same as you are very problem in the marketplace. You are spamming continuously.
As a result good sellers are facing may problems and bring bad reputation against own country.
This is very Disappointing incident.
You should fleeing shame !
For you ( such as same as yours) , freelancing marketplace plays new rules, new bindings for protecting spamming.
That’s why experienced freelancers going through many problems instead of relax work.
So stop it !!!

I do not make enough to fall into the category of sellers that need to fill out a W-9 form.
Regardless, every Us citizen must fill out the W9. Please read this notice by Fiverr. The first FAQ explains it.
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/w-9-collection
the_mad_duck:
Will my gigs be locked if I don’t complete it,
This is what the thread said
W-9 US Verification Requirement
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
the_mad_duck:
even though I don’t make enough to matter?
It does not matter if you do not make $20,000. The W9 must be filled out. Fiverr will send 1099 to the relevant tax authority only if you make $20,000.
W-9 US Verification Requirement
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.

Fiverr is not set up for sellers to “decline messages” that they don’t want to respond to. In fact, quite the opposite – sellers have 24 hours to respond to any messages that they receive, before not responding starts to penalize their response stat.

Great article, sadly it doesn’t answer the question. It is the first time that in 5 years I see that something is not working. At least in my case I don’t see the Gig views. There is no way of knowing whether or not that change in the algorithm is beneficial. Even changing and editing the Gigs, nobody is going to check if their Gigs are really being shown.
Generally that is what I do, when I see that nobody writes me I take actions, I create new Gigs, I try to lower prices, make offers. But this time how can you know?
I think it takes more than just a great 5 page post.
They need to solve the problem or maybe they have to tell us that things are like this now.!
Just as the “clearance times” at all levels changed one day, just as they placed a very complex penalty system based on various variables, perhaps now the idea is that we must be blind and trust as the red notice says ""We are doing things as always only that at the moment they are not seen """,N/A,"Jun 16, 2020 10:37 pm",2020-08-24 10:19:20.360115

I get 2* on Jun 2. My first negative review. (I have an old 1* but tend not to count it because it’s for that order auto-completing). It’s a funny story for another time. The order is Fiverr’s Choice.
On Jun 3 I receive 2 orders back to back from new people of my other gig that no one ever buys. It’s very interesting because I haven’t gotten multiple orders from new people on the same day ever since Covid happened.
I complete those, get 5* for both. My main gig is dead.
On Jun 4 the buyer who left me a negative review comes to my inbox and tries to force me to remove the response I’ve left to their review. I report the threat and contact CS. CS tells me there is no case, he had a right to leave a review, I had a right to respond.
On Jun 5 I get another Fiverr’s Choice order on my main gig, finish that one with 5*. The person buys another 3 designs as a custom package. This new custom offer is also marked as Fiverr’s choice. I complete it with 5*.
It’s been a deluge ever since. I got to my entire May earnings around June 12th.
I should mention that my regulars start coming back in June and they mostly order bigger custom packages. Well, bigger for me. My basic price is $50. They mostly buy $150-200 custom offers.
I also get a few new returning customers. We start with a basic package, they later come back to get another 3-4. If that has anything to do with, well, anything.
My delivery time was 3 days during quarantine, I had to switch it back to 4 days in June. Doesn’t seem to affect anything. I usually deliver 12-24 hours before the deadline.
May was terrible. I hit my “comfortable minimum” but barely. Had a few unpleasant interactions with buyers. I worked for that “comfortable minimum” hard.
No cancellations since Apr 1. Then I had the same custom offer canceled twice because the buyer couldn’t sort out their payment method. It led to $700 of canceled funds (my absolute record) handing over my head till Jun 1. CS assured me it wouldn’t affect anything but who knows.",N/A,"Jun 17, 2020 5:12 am",2020-08-24 10:19:27.252850

My feeling is that Fiverr’s approach was to attempt to just slip the extra layer (paid ads) into the existing algorithm … resulting in the whole thing falling apart.
I think they have always hand selected the top two rows at least, or been able to insert a few into those rows by hand instead of by algorithm.
I don’t think it fell apart. I think they may have altered it or changed what parameters it favors among gigs.
I think it was set to artificially boost some gigs and hold down other gigs that could have actually done better if things were left to rank gigs organically, so sellers could get orders even if they were less deserving for various reasons.
I think they took that set of parameters off in the last two months.

It is very important to look at the views, because generally when I was already finishing the work with the active orders I typically saw that Fiverr increased the impressions of my most successful Gigs.
When the up arrows indicated that views were increasing, customers would start writing to you. (this has been going on for 5 years).
Am i paranoid I like conspiracy theories?
It’s possible…
Maybe the problem is that I spend 15 years of my life developing applications for the cloud computing. (I’m system engineer)
One of the basic things according to ITIL best practices is the attention to breakdowns.
When a change is made in an active platform with millions of users there is always a plan to return in case it fails, there are data backups, there is always a contingency plan.
It is impossible that something as expensive as Fiverr has 1 month down.
Sorry but beleive , What happens here is NOT a bug.
Something they are trying, it is probably the promotions (but I do not know).
They may have decided that people who don’t pay won’t get any promotions. Maybe they stop charging us 20% and return our money in less time. Maybe things changed. Maybe they are testing our reaction.
It is also possible that they have decided to change the entire model and they do not care what we think.
In a pandemic, confined, many people looking for money and supplies in many countries and Fiverr “fallen”?
They have to explain something to us …",N/A,"Jun 17, 2020 8:40 am",2020-08-24 10:19:37.650092

Think about Facebook, in the beggining they show the contentes for everyone, when they implement the ADS they start to restring the reach of posts.
But they get 20% of each sale!! Fiverr is your parther!!
In FB case you can promote something thats true! But you don’t have to pay FB subscription. FB is free…
The best example is Netflix vs. Youtube. You pay one fee on Netflix, right? ok, so you don’t see Ads. Because you spend money!!!
Youtube is free!!! So, it’s logical to see some ads or pay the premium account to eliminate.
Here is a Mess. You get just 80% of your money 14 days later, of course , this is beacuse Fiverr need 20% of your money to promote your services!!!
One question. Anyone with any merit can come and promote services??? Just need money?

But they get 20% of each sale!! Fiverr is your parther!!
Partners don’t demote people making $1,500 to $2,000 a month, or more.
Fiverr is not a partner, Fiverr is a platform.
If you want a partner, find a friend or family member and go into business together.
A platform doesn’t care about the individual success of their members.
The 20% doesn’t bother me, I would gladly pay 30%, even 50%, if I could make $19,000 like I did in 2015. If Fiverr wanted me to raise prices, rewarded me for doing so, if they told me what gigs to create, delete, etc. If they gave me gig images.

Please can you explain me a bit about fiverr’s choice, I mean are sellers selected for it or gigs? and when someone places an order, does fiverr see that this order is a bit interesting and mark the order as fiverr’s choice before you delivering it or it works the other way?
Hi, I know didn’t ask me, but I think no one answered. Fiverr’s Choice is given to the gig, not the seller. Some people believe it’s manually chosen, but I think it’s the algorithm and it has to do with maintaining 5 stars and probably has a lot to do with the secret reviews as well.
I’ve been Fiverr’s Choice almost continuously since March but only a few of my orders say they are “Fiverr’s Choice orders”. I think it’s because the badge doesn’t show with every keyword, so the ones that say they are, it just means that particular buyer chose me after seeing the badge.

I have always believed that all those variables that we must comply with are beneficial.
I live in a Latin American country that has a dictatorship, hyperinflation, electrical problems and insecurity.
On one occasion there was a 100 hour blackout, some clients here at Fiverr understood the situation, others did not!
Fulfill on time, have the best quality, low prices that is Fiverr.
For this reason, it is vital that Fiverr resolve the situation and define it.
We must always comply! The customer is generally right!

The 20% doesn’t bother me, I would gladly pay 30%, even 50%, if I could make $19,000 like I did in 2015. If Fiverr wanted me to raise prices, rewarded me for doing so, if they told me what gigs to create, delete, etc. If they gave me gig images. Then I would have a partner.
This is the point! I agree 100% with you.
If we are going to make money like in 2015 or more, let’s go now!
The problem is that most of them are not receiving messages, clicks, orders.
Most of us are seeing the Fiverr blackout.
If the new scheme makes us earn money and we must maintain quality, I AGREE!
The fact is that everything is turned off.
Oh , Sorry.
You do have 7 orders waiting and you raised the prices and everything works only for you! Congratulations!
But, since it is a Platform with millions of users, it is very dangerous to remove sellers from the ecosystem. Because the quality falls and on the Internet the availability time is everything!
Many buyers do not now get most of the sellers we have been working for 5 or more years here!
That is a reality!

I have been searching Fiverr as a buyer user. If I can see Gigs when I search, I even see level2, level1 and Top. The truth is that I am NOT in that search (I used to do it was always there).
As nobody knows how to answer what happens, I think this is a change in policy. There are people working! But it is not us!
Is that possible?
A user here on this forum said yesterday that he did have orders! If you are looking for vendors, we may not be the same as always. Maybe Fiverr decided to change things.
The other option I see is that there is something we must change in the GIGs. New Tags? prices? Names? something?",N/A,"Jun 20, 2020 11:53 am",2020-08-24 10:20:01.664946

Sure!
I have been researching other platforms and Fiverr is the only one with that business model. In Fiverr anyone could enter, in the others it is not so easy, even most of them have to pay. Some even investigate and protect their sellers with messages like “I’m sorry but I have many sellers just like you.”
So I think it is possible that Fiverr is changing the business model. They must be trying something and we will soon see that everything is different. I don’t think a one month failure is the cause. There is something else …
In this forum there are other topics and I read that there are people receiving orders even reporting topics of the evaluations and rates so as not to miss the levels…
The question is: Why do they see clients and we don’t?",N/A,"Jun 21, 2020 2:17 pm",2020-08-24 10:20:11.918034

It is very difficult to know if Fiverr is doing its job of exposing our Gigs because there is no way to see the numbers.
First of all, this is NOT Fiverr’s job.
Fiverr is nothing but a marketplace, and the amount of work you get is by far most influenced by supply and demand. If you do a good job, and your clients are happy, you move up in the world and get more orders. There are different other factors, for example, if you are doing this full time or just as a side thing, also it is important to be online, as many customers want a fast/instant reply, etc.
The gig stat “issue” has no relevance, it is just metrics that they show you.
Personally I am getting the same number of daily requests I have always had.
I see that you are musician, as such I am sure you are very well aware of the impact COVID19 has had on the music industry, it is simply not something essential for most companies, and if no money is coming in it will quickly go very far down on the companies list of priorities.
I am sure things will start looking up for you soon.
I wish you good luck and all the best!",N/A,"Jun 23, 2020 7:59 am",2020-08-24 10:20:28.194286

First of all, this is NOT Fiverr’s job.
Hi Patrick, Thanks for write! COngratulations you are the second person who have no problem at all here, of course I know this post is too long now. So , it’s difficult to read…
Patrick lot off sellers on Fiverr have been experiencing a blackout.
During the entire pandemic I was full of work here. Suddenly everything stopped. No messages, no orders and I left the search lists.
The first thing I thought was that it was my problem! Quickly searching the forum I understood that it was not just me, there were other sellers with the problem.
What happens to the vast majority?
Having the best possible level, fulfilling everything on time and with 5-star evaluations took us out of the game.
Patrick, there are people here who have written indicating that they are Top Rated, they received 50 orders on average and today they have nothing.
Friend something is wrong with Fiverr.
It is evident that if I am 5 years old in this I already understood what I must do to go up in the lists, but the case of the Top Rated who have large incomes is even clearer that this sudden blackout is not normal.
Fiverr is making changes to its platform to introduce a new scheme with paid ads. Many say the forum that they have decided to “move” things especially with classic vendors that have Gigs for years producing…
This new method with ads is already in the testing stage for very few users. That’s not the problem!! The problem is that most of us were removed from the search lists.
patrickcharlie:
Fiverr is nothing but a marketplace, and the amount of work you get is by far most influenced by supply and demand.
In this you are right! Let me explain now how that “supply - demand” works on Fiverr.
A buyer searches Fiverr for a service.
Fiverr shows him a list of sellers. That has been changing over the years. Now Fiverr Pro users appear at the top (which makes total sense) and then users with rankings appear and the list turns pages to leave those less relevant at the end.
Fiverr exposes your Gig to its community, for this reason it takes away 20% of your income and also retains your money for 14 days.
That is Fiverr’s job. and they must show you that they are exposing you in exchange for that 20%, that you will receive if you have done things well and on time.
Of course it is supply and demand, but Fiverr by exposing you is telling buyers “Look at the work of this seller” “It is reliable” “It is fast” “Hundreds of users have made positive reviews”
The relation “Supply - demand” is not magic, Fiverr shows the work and the buyers choose.
That has now lost its meaning! Just read yourself to great sellers here who are experiencing the same so that you understand what you may face …
Thank you for your words and I hope that everything continues well.
Fiverr is a platform and we are understanding as a community what happens here? As soon as we understand it, maybe we can adapt or maybe not!
I also hope that Fiverr returns to be a great platform. Only they have that business model maybe they are changing it",N/A,"Jun 23, 2020 8:33 am",2020-08-24 10:20:28.610557

Also a message to all people who are facing issues, how is your industry doing outside of fiverr? That is something you should keep track of, COVID did not impact all industries the same and not all of them at the same time, some industries are yet to feel the aftermath of COVID, some were hit in the beginning and so on.
So make sure, that you on your side have done absolutely EVERYTHING you can before jumping to conclusions.
I noticed many sellers have some idea about what is important in their industry, but they simply do not know how business in general works - and that is perfectly fine, just find someone to help you out, to coach you, train you or simply consult you.

Hi there! Friend, when you have a cancellation on Fiverr it is very likely that you will be penalized. That has only happened to me a few times, problems have happened to me with some clients and the result is always that this index falls below 90% and you lose the level in the evaluation.

YOU need to value your work
Great Patrick.!
The main idea here is win - win. I agree 100% with you!
If your service is good, it must have a cost, of course it is a market, but that price war on services is pointless.
Doing a service for 5USD so that you have 4USD that is also subject to approval and they give you 14 days later it does not make sense.
Another problem is if Fiverr offers people such low-cost services, are they really quality?
In my case it became impossible to lower prices further.",N/A,"Jun 24, 2020 1:17 pm",2020-08-24 10:20:34.915344

reduce my prices
Sarika is good to ask yourself this question. Can you keep those ridiculously low prices going forward? If you offer the customer something for 50 and end up doing it for 10, don’t you think he thought you wanted to steal it?
I have years at Fiverr and the truth is that the best jobs and the best experiences are when the client values your effort and you receive what is fair for your work.
Once I accepted a great job because there were many services ( they were many). In the end I couldn’t finish that job well, since the same person who asked to lower prices, as soon as we started began to behave as if he had paid the higher price. I’m talking about something worth maybe 100 leaving it at 30. It was a terrible experience and when I delivered the disputes began. They asked me for changes that were out of budget. They also asked for things that had settled in again.
I understood that it would never end, and the cancellation led me to lose the level and drop a lot in sales also at that time.
It is better to charge fair because you can spend more than you receive. That makes no sense!",N/A,"Jun 24, 2020 1:25 pm",2020-08-24 10:20:35.310178

Regular",4,"No one said there’s a new “Fiverr policy”.
We are all experiencing pretty much the same thing to a different degree.
We are all assuming what may be happening, but no one knows for sure.
My assumption was that there was a significant change to how the algorithm responds and how fast it moves.
I also theorized that the Covid-19 pandemic definitely acted as an accelerator, with all the new accounts being created and with buyers changing how much they are willing to spend on certain things.
But while we are all in the dark, it’s pretty clear this is not a new policy.
We are experiencing a weird shift in the marketplace and we are exchanging insights and experiences.",N/A,"Jun 26, 2020 9:56 am",2020-08-24 10:20:39.908489

yeah we hope so fiverr will understand what problems we are facing
Friend believe me! After months with this problem I think it is a change. It is not a Bug!
They usually solve a bug in hours.
This is a new way of working with Fiverr, some of us are left out and others continue to sell.
In this post there are dozens of people with the same problem as us, but a couple of people say they continue to sell …
If you look in that search list of Fiverr there are people selling right now, we after 5 years and all the merit are no longer there.

I don’t think they talk about problems on the platform. But I think they will explain where Fiverr is going.
When we all understand this new path, we will likely find a way to participate.
Frank after all this time let’s face it, Fiverr has no mistakes!
It is a new way of operating maybe they will explain there…

Hi there!
Thanks for writing here!
Here you have my profile
https://www.fiverr.com/carlosrada?up_rollout=true 3
I’ve been on Fiverr by 5 years, as you can see all my Gig appear to be “active”. Saddly many sellers have the same problem, I think you have it now!
Nobody nows exactly the reason of this wear shift. Some seller have this problem like 2-3 months.
At first we thought it was a BUG because the views are not seen but I think this is the new Fiverr normal.
Other sellers have said in this long post that it is the new “paid advertising” scheme. We understand that a few sellers are testing it and that it will be operational soon.
It is evident that advertising will change the position of the sellers in the search lists, and it is possible that this current situation is the first step towards it.
I sincerely believe that the Fiverr business model will change, this is the only platform that operates in this way. They already included the famous “paid certification courses” and only “paid advertising” was missing for Fiverr to become something very similar to its well-known competition …
I think that those of us who have been working here for years must adapt, some sellers suggest having several different work options on other platforms or increasing the presence of your personal brand to make your customer portfolio.
I will always thank Fiverr for giving me the opportunity to make music for more than 25 countries on 5 continents.
We will be back? I do not know…
Do Fiverr want us back? I do not know too…
Do we have to change to continue? That is for sure, we are all doing it with the pandemic …",N/A,"Jul 4, 2020 5:40 pm",2020-08-24 10:20:48.762777
