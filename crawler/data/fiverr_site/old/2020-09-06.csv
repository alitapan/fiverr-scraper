I remember it being a bit slower with Payoneer when it came to getting paid. But, Fiverr has it on record, so if it’s stuck somewhere, they should be able to get it sent your way.
Have you checked your Payoneer account just in case to see if you received any messages/notifications? I’d also double check your email to see if you got anything about it.
One thing I thought of, is that maybe it’s a graphical glitch you’re seeing and the money is still there ready to be withdrawn. If so, signing out and back in might fix it. Or clearing your browser cache. To me, it sounds like it could be an issue like that, especially if you didn’t go through with the withdrawal.
Otherwise, I think it’s probably stuck on fiverr’s end, or there’s a hold for some reason.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 3:22 am",2020-09-06 15:25:06.760312

This is what i did… Clicked on Bank transfer, popup message came as “some problem in withdrawal please contact customer support” along with “continue to withdraw” button… I just clicked cancelled and came back to earnings page.
From then status was “Withdraw initiated” and thats it no action after that
As I did not proceed to click on withdraw ,i dont know how the balance amount became zero.
Yea I removed cache and restarted my machine. Even then status is still in “Initiated” and no money in my balance.
I hope this should get solved soon and get my money back.

I had a thought. Maybe it’s a graphical error on fiverr’s side, and your money is still waiting to be withdrawn. Is there an option to withdraw still? I’d give it a try if so. If not, your best bet would be to wait for CS to get back to you.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-09-06 15:25:07.539541

It’s a great idea, because it will bring more traffic and revenue to the platform - If a certain service that a buyer saved gets discounted, a notification about the discount will appear. This way, the seller that decided to discount his gig will reach all the people that were already interest in his gig so he’ll definitely be getting new orders and the buyers will be able to get the service they wanted for a cheaper price (As they probably couldn’t afford it at the time).

So i initiated a withdrawal from fiverr through PAYPAL and i got an email from paypal to claim my money. At that time my kyc for receiving local and global payments was not submitted and they said its not verified. (I messaged the paypal cs). Also i got an email from paypal saying they are waiting for me to submit a few missing documents inorder to deposit the fund(the kyc and i got to know it only after a lot of researching). And if its not verified the fund gets reversed to the sender(FIverr) in 1 month time. The problem is i have submitted all my kyc after this email and after 2 days from my withdrawal initiated. Now the Paypal asks me to contact fiverr and resend the payment once again, Which i dont know how it becomes possible. This is my first paypal transaction and would appreciate it if anybody has the solution to this. Fiver earnings shows withdrawal initiated and deducted the money- The paypal button is greyed out showing withdrawal in progress- the WITHDRAWN tab has $0 as it doesnt display the amount withdrawn which i think is due to the incomplete transaction. The only solution i see as of now is wait for 30 days to reverse the fund in fiverr again and then initiate withdrawal again. Is there anything i am missing here or can anything else be done to receive my money sooner before this 30 day wait as im in urgent need of it. I’d appreciate if anybody can help.

Yes, both audios sound the same, I check them. There is no distortion or background noise on the two recordings.
To me, French is a very interesting language so it sounds great, the color of your voice is also great, and the audio quality is very much up to standard.
I do not know what is a demand for French st the moment but I do know that people who are selling in the VO category have frequent sales.
I wanted to do VO service too since I have a professional studio microphone and setting but at the moment I am writing a book so all my focus should be on that.
Désolé pour la réponse tardive, j’ai un voisin agressif qui doit se retenir. Je menace juste d’appeler la police. Nous verrons.
Oui, les deux audios sonnent de la même manière, je les vérifie. Il n’y a pas de distorsion ou de bruit de fond sur les deux enregistrements.
Pour moi, le français est une langue très intéressante, donc ça sonne bien, la couleur de votre voix est également excellente et la qualité audio est tout à fait à la hauteur.
Je ne sais pas quelle est la demande pour le français en ce moment mais je sais que les gens qui vendent dans la catégorie VO ont des ventes fréquentes.

Actually, the idea of splitting fiction from non-fiction book editing only came to me from the incessant prompts to update my gigs and to fill out all possible information. So I was prompted to specify which kind of book I offer to edit. So it was either “generic” or just one of the two (fiction/non-fiction), which was why I then decided to split them.
It frankly seems to me a little unfair to set up the system like this, but will now be better equipped to dealing with it (after your advice).
I do find it would be helpful if duplicating would be made possible as a basis for further changes as we are all working people and this will save up quite some time. But so be it…

I’m not sure about that; typically, you don’t get asked for the security question answer for withdrawing money, I think that’s for things like when you change your email or phone number, or payment info, or such, but I can’t recall if I got asked for it when I withdrew for the first time perhaps, as that was close to 4 years ago.

Anyone has had the same problem ?",N/A,N/A,N/A,crisnelyn,0,"Hi guys,
I want to update you on how I didn’t receive any support from the Fiverr customer service, I received a useless email from Sam of the customer service asking me for my 3 Paypal transactions ID and he said that the error is because of my bank.
I saw many people got this problems, so far I have 0 refund and a customer service that is not reading what I wrote.
I mentioned that I tried to pay twice using the credit card method but I got a message saying the transaction has failed please try again.
Afterwards I tried to pay with my credit card using the Paypal method and it worked.
Now the Fiverr customer service is asking for 3 transactions ID… how can I get them.
And they said that it’s because of my bank the payment has failed.
In the meantime I still have my 3 payments charged by Fiverr.",N/A,"Apr 14, 2017 3:55 am",2020-09-06 15:26:59.110376

I wanted to open the files and clarify the request then I log in to the Fiverr site via my desktop.
then I have noticed there are no 7 attachments. only one file was visible.
but in the mobile app, all files are there. also, the customer has mentioned some file names but I only see one file on the desktop view.

If I am constantly on Fiverr in my inbox responding to messages, how can I be offline for short period of time?
What qualifies as “online”, that is the question. When I am looking at my profile it says I am online, but when I am reading and responding to my messages in inbox it says I am offline.

And for that you need to know the rules if you would’ve know the rules you wouldn’t even bother to worry that someone will report you when they are the ones breaking rules.
Just read terms of services and you wouldn’t be scared anymore because you will know the rules and when you are or wrong. Fiverr doesn’t punish you if someone reported you but you haven’t done anything wrong",N/A,"Sep 3, 2020 10:20 pm",2020-09-06 15:28:14.223039

I know that the current situation in the world might cause that but I can’t understand why did I stop receiving any message? In March and April combined I received around 40-50 messages and, as I said, since this problem started I haven’t got a single message.
And when I search my gig sometimes it’s on the last page and other times I can not even find it.
Spamming “thank you” in every topic about this bug won’t help anyone.
We have to make Fiverr the best place for freelancers together and pointing out to the issues is one step closer to that goal.
Please don’t unpin this topic as you did with the last one.

But they don’t/didn’t. Before they changed the website code to show “N/A” for everything, the most recent few days were showing 0 for everyone. So the most recent days totals were getting either stored as 0 or null or not being stored at all in the place in the db the analytics page looks (reads) to show them, and still are likely not (otherwise they’d have removed the code that shows “N/A” in every field). So I don’t really think it’s just a “display issue”. ie. the more recent figures are wrong somewhere in the database (even if they’re right/stored in some other place).
So I’d say the correct daily totals for clicks etc. can’t be stored in the database currently for the days since it went wrong (started showing 0 for everyone). But it’s possible that there’s another table/file where the values needed to create those daily totals and that that is working okay (though it’s strange that it’s not been fixed so far).",N/A,"May 17, 2020 3:14 am",2020-09-06 15:29:37.106824

Why are sellers treated this way? And for those claiming nothing wrong with the algorithm… The algorithm is about programming for God sake, an error can occur on the program which causes algorithm to misfunction, that’s why we have debugging in programming in order to fix issue in a program…

I don’t see how this “fanboy” attitude helps anyone.
He has his opinion that people should do things to try to improve their gigs and situation on their own. There is some merit in that. I realize people seem to be in a panic right now.
As I said, every time someone on the forum is saying their gigs have disappeared:
they are delivering orders currently or have orders in their queue
or
They cannot find their own gigs since they don’t know how to search for them.
I haven’t tried looking at people’s gigs for everyone who complains, only about 6 sellers. I did find one who was correct that his gigs were not on the first four pages.
The rest had their gigs displayed and I found them within less than ten seconds.

I am affected by this – and have been many times over the past few years. This is nothing new, and it does not stop a good seller from being successful. I have learned how to work withing the system, and I have learned how to overcome the obstacles. I am trying to help other people think for themselves, and learn to overcome these obstacles as well.
Just because the loud voices, that like to complain, don’t want to listen, doesn’t make me wrong, or the facts untrue. This is nothing new. The algorithm is working, and it is normal for gigs to rotate – and yes, move to the last page from time to time. This has happened to me half a dozen times or more over the past few years, and my gigs have always rotated back over time.
Be patient, learn to adapt, and please stop complaining as if this is the end of the world. It isn’t.

As you all I am facing the same issue. My gig was on the first page and now I can’t even find it in first 10 pages. No new clients no new messages. Then I messaged fiverr team and they told me my gig is totally fine. So I was really confused by not knowing what actually happened. Then I thought I should act positively.
If fiverr says they are working on it, surely they will be doing so. We have nothing to do with that. I don’t remember they waited us this much in the past few years. They might be facing some practical issues in this pandemic. That might be the reason for taking it this longer.
So these are the things I did
I update all my gigs again. Then I found out some gigs have lack of keywords and some have unwanted and wrong keywords
And I saw that fiverr has given a new place to put your “SEO TITLE”. Some of you might know about this already. If not, please go and update your SEO TITLE today.
Then I update the FAQ for many of my gigs. I hope it might help your client to understand your service much better.
Here is the most important thing. I saw my gig description works fine on desktop but not on mobile devices. Some of my gigs didn’t have spaces between paragraphs when it comes to mobile view. But it was totally fine in desktop view. We all know now everybody uses mobile. So this will have a real effect in your gigs.
Also, I take few fiverr tests related to my service. So I could verify few of my skills
And one last thing I did was, I spent a few bucks on “Learn from fiverr” tutorials related to my service to upgrade my skills. I must say these tutorials are Amazing. Specially tutorials from Mr. Daniel Walter Scott was excellent. I invite you to watch these tutorials and you will thank me one day. Also, you will get few badges at the end as a bonus and they will be displayed on your profile forever.
So these are the things I did in this bad situation. Because I thought doing something is better than waiting. Let’s hope for the best",N/A,"May 17, 2020 3:13 pm",2020-09-06 15:29:57.394260

As the message in the orange bar clearly indicates, your gig’s ability to gain metrics, and appearance in the search results have absolutely nothing to do with the display issue on your Gigs page.
The message clearly states:
“No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.”
The display issue has nothing to do with the success or visibility of your gigs. Fiverr has literally said this, word for word. Please stop perpetuating false claims.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 1:23 am",2020-09-06 15:30:11.597127

Not lots compared to the total number of sellers on Fiverr. They’re just loud on the forum, but then again, you have a similar loud group every now and then. They blame the change in algorithm, the holidays, this change, that change… And sales come and go, no matter what, and it can happen to sellers of any level.
Many sellers are still getting sales (just look at all the topics about their first sale, their first $1000, whatever).
It’s pretty much the usual, with those who haven’t been getting sales lately now blaming the inability to see their metrics instead of blaming the algorithm, covid, Fiverr sabotaging them on purpose, or somebody’s dog.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 2:28 am",2020-09-06 15:30:12.385045

I don’t see why all of these people are “a loud group” when some are top sellers.
Fiverr also said this would be fixed days ago. Whatever the case is, it’s an issue and should have been sorted by now. This is the most prominent site in it’s field and they make a hell of a lot of money, the problem must be a truly serious one for it to be going on for this long.

i know it’s odd people say they had dozens of messages daily or weekly and now have none
I don’t know for how long you’ve been on Fiverr forum, but every now and then, there is a number of sellers (not always the same sellers, of course) who complain about the exact same thing, and it’s been like that for years, when the problem with displaying metrics didn’t exist.
mattheweveringh:
I don’t see why all of these people are “a loud group” when some are top sellers.
I call them the loud group because there’s always a loud group complaining about not getting sales, and because they keep saying the same thing, you get the impression that their number is huge, even though there are sellers who keep getting sales (but they don’t come to the forum to repeatedly say that). And level has nothing to do with it, top sellers can suddenly stop getting sales, too.
Now the ones who are not getting sales are even louder than usual, probably because of the pandemic panic.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 6:21 am",2020-09-06 15:30:16.393272

Fiverr has told everyone what is happening. They stated it quite clearly in the orange bar on your Gigs page. They have said that there is a metrics display issue, which they are working on fixing, but that display issue has nothing to do with the active status of gigs, or any gig’s appearance in the search algorithm. You know what is happening. There is nothing else that Fiverr needs to tell you.
shimizuhiroshi1:

Not at all. Fiverr’s “silence” likely just means that they haven’t been able to fix the errors yet.

It’s working for you Great. Isn’t working for many of Us That’s it.
I experience the same things all the loud voices are complaining about right now. I am not immune just because I am a Fiverr veteran. The search algorithm affects us all equally. The difference is, I work with the system, instead of complaining when it doesn’t do what I want or make me more visible than someone else. There are thousands of people who want to be on the first page of search results, but there isn’t room for them on that page. This is why the system rotates all gigs (based upon internal factors we do not need to know about).
If you are rotated “to the last page”, be patient, and you will likely be rotated back. This has happened to me many times over the past few years. Yes, it happens to me, and no, I am not complaining about it over and over here on the forums – like the current loud voices are.
This is how the search algorithm works.
sameed_webdev:
We aren’t getting any response from Buyers .
It is a terribly irresponsible concept to expect the Fiverr search system to work in your favor, and provide you with all of your orders. If you aren’t getting the kind of orders you want from the search system, then please take responsibility for your own success, and market and promote your gigs to your target customers – on your own – wherever they may be located. All businesses have to do this. Here on Fiverr, you are a businessman too, so I don’t understand why hard self-motivated work doesn’t apply to the loud voices here, on the forums?
Fiverr says the search system is working like it should. This clarification is clearly posted on everyone’s Gigs page. As Fiverr clearly states, the analytics display error has nothing to do with gigs being active, and functioning properly, within the search system.
sameed_webdev:
Kindly Take into consideration what others are going through.
I am well aware of the nature of the complaints being voiced here. Complaints, however, do not equal truth, especially when Fiverr has clearly spelled out the nature of the error (and it’s connection to anything else). Complaining about something that Fiverr says is not broken, is not going to result in the search system being changed to adhere to the demands being voiced here.
Please be patient. The analytics DISPLAY ERROR will be fixed when Fiverr fixes it.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 4:32 pm",2020-09-06 15:30:25.780408

Let me tell you something, there is what we call Market Strategy, if a business or an organization is affected one way or the other, in order to protect the interest of people patronizing them, they may say nothing is wrong with the business or say everything under control, this is just to calm the people down and not letting them fret or run away.
Look at the statistics issue for over 3 weeks, Fiverr is yet to rectify it and that same time alot of sellers complaining of missing gig, I did a test above in which I told you to carry out but you seem not interested because you know something is wrong with the system.
I don’t want you always saying that phrase that “Fiverr say”, what if they are trying to protect the interest of the community and people using it thereby trying to calm everybody down and not fret, and they are not telling us what we suppose to know?.. I respect you @jonbaas and I will always do so.

what if they are trying to protect the interest of the community and people using it thereby trying to calm everybody down and not fret, and they are not telling us what we suppose to know?
So what if they are? Look at how some people are reacting. They need to be calmed down. This is not the big disaster people are acting like it is.
This is nothing. I wish people would stop making it into something it’s not.
Maybe they got tired of always being asked why someone’s impressions went down. I would have taken those stats off a long time ago the way people were always obsessing over them and not realizing how it’s normal to have them go up and down.",N/A,"May 19, 2020 9:16 pm",2020-09-06 15:30:29.314280

why people are so upset about them not being shown.
It’s because Gig’s rotation might be not working properly. Despite Fiverr says everything is carried out the way it should be.

more than 100+ Peoples Complaining on forum that There gig is not appearing on search
Please share your source for this number of people complaining. I’ve been around, here on the forums for years, and it doesn’t look like any more people now, than those who are usually complaining about this sort of thing in the past. The issue is a DISPLAY error. It has nothing to do with a gig’s ability to perform. As Fiverr states – clearly – on everyone’s Gigs page, all gigs are still gaining analytics, those analytics just aren’t being DISPLAYED. Gigs and the algorithm are working just fine.
vidvox:
Because Like me Many Other Peoples Follow Gig Analytics Page Because its Really Helps us a lot to check How Our Gigs are performing.
I don’t know. It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success. The analytics stats are just numbers. Success does not depend upon those numbers. Success depends upon the ACTIONS sellers take, and, as far as I’ve seen, most of the sellers complaining about the display error, are also the same sellers that aren’t taking any productive ACTIONS to become successful.
Analytics stats will not guarantee success. Sitting around and watching numbers rise and fall won’t result in profitable gigs. Stop staring at the numbers, and start doing research, promotion, marketing, experimentation, taking risks, etc.

And Who said we are just sitting and watching numbers and Waiting for Success?
I Have 5* Rating Over more than 200 orders. 99 % Order completion, 100% response Rate and I remain Active on Fiverr Almost 24 hrs. Making Gigs Everyday Sharing My Gigs, Promoting My Gig and Also Taking Fiver Success Courses Searching on Internet and Taking Tips From Successful Buyer is My Daily Routine So Don’t Tell me that We are Just sitting Back and Waiting For Success.
Stats Are Important Because That’s How We Know Our Gigs Performance. That’s How we Know How Many Views Clicks or Impressions We Got After Sharing Our Gig. Stats Clearly Tells Us the Working of Our Gig. Also Fiver Algorithms Depend on Stats. Right Now Fiver algorithms did not get any response from Stats and That’s why Many Buyers Facing Issues in Gig Rotation. A Person has Only 2-3 Sales and he is in Best Selling page No 15 and A Person has 2000+ Sales with 5* Rating he is No where in Best Selling. Surely That’s a Problem Mate.
I Ask A question to the other User (misscrystal) that If Fiver Has a Option for Sellers Then Surely It Has Something to Do with Sellers and If That Option is not working Surely its a problem for Sellers. If its Only a Display Issue Then Fiver can Hire Many Programmers for 5$ to Fix Display Issue and If its Only a Display issue than answer one thing why its taking weeks to sort out??

None of this guarantees that you (specifically, in relation to your argument) are entitled to have your gigs appear on the first page of search results. Fiverr does not guarantee any gig placement in the search results, and they do not guarantee orders – to anyone – just because they have gigs or high ratings on Fiverr.

Maybe Fiverr is not able to hire new people right now. The world is struggling through a pandemic, and millions of people are losing their jobs because companies cannot afford to keep as many employees as they once had. The world is not as black and white as you seem to view it to be.

Actually, you can’t lose something you never had. It is a false presumption that you can lose money that you have not yet earned. You are not losing money, you are losing time by complaining about something here, on the forums, that has no connection to how your gig performs in the search results. Perhaps your focus should, instead, be on developing a better gig that can more easily be connected to the needs of your target customers.

I am on fiverr from 2 years.
Like Me Many Users, I also Used analytics page to See their progress and That’s How we see our gig performance and that’s how we Speed up our Marketing and sharing policies in order to gain good impressions and Get some Good Response From Buyer.
My Question is Very Simple . Like You and 2 Other Persons in this forum , You are Saying Stats are Useless and This is Just a Display Issue . I Mean If Stats Are Working then why Fiverr Taking so much time to Resolve a display Issue? Even a Person who build website for 50$ knows how to Resolve Display issues and Fiverrr a millionaire Company Does not know how to resolve display issue???
Surely its not a display issue its more than this that’s why a millionaire company is struggling from weeks to sort out. Our Demand is Simple Fiverr Has Given us a Option to Keep track of our gigs performance ad activity and Previously with that it was working fine. Now If That option is hurting many sellers like me its our Right to ask fiverr to resolve this issue. My argument is not with you and I Have not started this with you. But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
Lastly Fiverr is Open for all its not mine or yours only property to work with. We work with sellers Give them Revisions and After a bunch of Hard work we get only 4$ , on the other hand without too much work fiverr take 3$ from per order . So If you calculate this , it will come up as a million dollar daily fiverr gets. So then They should show some maturity , Have capacity of bearing New Customers and They should be able to sort out Bugs like this.

But Your Opinion is wrong that its just a display issue.
I am not wrong, because I am expressing the exact comments Fiverr themselves have stated. Fiverr specifically says, on every seller’s Gigs page: ""We’re working on getting your Gigs’ impressions, clicks, and views back online. No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual.""
Why is it so hard to believe what Fiverr is telling you?
If Fiverr says this is how things are, then this is how things are. You demanding to be given a different answer does not make Fiverr wrong. Fiverr is not lying to you.
vidvox:
So then They should show some maturity
You need to show some patience. Fiverr will fix the display issue when they fix the issue. You demanding to have what you want, right now, because you think Fiverr is immature, and not working fast enough for you, isn’t going to make them fix things any faster. The display issue will be fixed when it is fixed. Fiverr told you this. I am telling your this. And plenty of other forum users have told you this.
Your opinions are not how things work. I have proven this with Fiverr’s own statement on the issue. Everyone else can see the same exact Fiverr statement on their Gigs page. It is what Fiverr says it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 5:14 am",2020-09-06 15:30:59.223653

It sounds, to me, like many sellers are addicted to seeing stats, and they have come to believe that the stats guarantee them success.

I am curious to know what exactly people do when for example they see their impressions going down. I have seen a lot of threads where people are upset that these go down sometimes. Is there some sure way to make them go back up after they go down?

Well, as you know, none of us have control over impressions, so, in all honesty, there’s nothing any of us can do to make them go up again. I just ride out that wave, and let the algorithm do what it does. I don’t live and die by the things I cannot control.

I think people are obsessed with their stats.
I think there’s a big difference between being ‘obsessed’ with stats, and ‘interested’ in stats, yet a lot of the responses I’ve read on this thread suggest that even having a passing interest in stats is foolish and a waste of time. I simply can’t wrap my head around that way of thinking.
Do you need stats to sell? No, of course not. Just like you don’t need money to be happy. But it helps, right? Stats help you to make decisions about your business based on actual metrics, as opposed to speculation.
The metrics in Fiverr are woefully bad as-is. I’d love to know what keywords drove buyers to our gigs. I’d love to know which demos buyers listened to - how many times on average a buyer visited our gig before buying etc etc… All of these are metrics we could be shown, whilst still maintaining buyer privacy, and they would give us actionable insight to make changes to our gigs with.

what keywords drove buyers to our gigs. I’d love to know which demos buyers listened to - how many times on average a buyer visited our gig before buying etc etc…
This is exactly what Google Analytics could bring on table.
Fiverr could implement GA for L2 and TRS. It would be advantage for those who understand data analytics and can use it.
It would be also motivation for L0 and L1 for growth. The reward would be “real” analytics.
Those three - impressions, views and clicks that were available to sellers are just three figures that none can effectively use. If someone knows how I would like to know it.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 6:34 am",2020-09-06 15:31:02.989727

Once again I agree. That’s why I suggested that people do what they can to improve their gigs and how they process and deliver orders, as well as improving their skills if needed.
I also think fiverr does choose quality gigs for the first page at least, sometimes.
I mostly pay attention to my own category but skimming through each page of listings it does start to look like there is a descending order to the gigs somehow.

It’s unfortunate if we’ve reached a point where we’re suggesting that we can only achieve quality by hiding useful information from people. That would suggest a total lack of trust. Can quality gigs, gig-SEO and useful metrics not all exist at the same time? We’re all grown-ups… most of us will do what is right for both us as sellers, and Fiverr as a platform.

Well you say why can’t Fiverr trust all sellers.
With respect, you’ve paraphrased me a little there. What I said was that most of us will do the right thing, and for those who don’t, punishments exist to discourage bad behaviour, and I was referring only to being able to see some basic metrics related only to our own gigs, not giving out my username and password to random strangers, which is why I said we’re not quite comparing the same thing.
For clarity, my two pence on this is that Fiverr could and should give us more, higher quality metrics to work with. As Fiverr grows and evolves as a business (now an NYSE listed company, not some tin-pot freelance site), and as we all grow as sellers, why can’t we understand a little more about customer behaviour behind the scenes, when it’s related to our own gigs? That’s evolution. Exploitation will always happen, that’s what sensible risk-mitigation, rules and punishments exist for.
That’s my opinion, nothing more, and I totally get and respect that a number of people disagree with me.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 7:52 am",2020-09-06 15:31:07.387754

I’m not saying this is the right thing to do, I do agree statistics are important to help improve marketing and understand business needs. But possibly Fiverr has a different goal.
Absolutely agree with you. But something that I feel often gets missed in conversations, is that Fiverr has two sets of customers - the ones who buy the products, and the ones who pay the seller fees. We’re customers of Fiverr too, just a different type. It’s a cliche, but it’s true; without sellers there would be no Fiverr.
And for all the enormous improvements that buyers have seen in the way they interact with the Fiverr platform over the years, I feel that we as sellers haven’t seen quite the same level of improvements.
I’m hopeful that will change, and I’m excited about the Promoted Gigs feature that’s hopefully launching soon. It would make sense to bundle some new metrics in with that, so who knows?",N/A,"May 22, 2020 8:04 am",2020-09-06 15:31:08.187581

I am curious to know what exactly people do when for example they see their impressions going down.
They spam the social media and forums and everything they can with their gig links.
It’s even an advice you’ve certainly seen countless times on the forum, when someone is new and asking how to get “sells”: post your gigs on social media to increase impressions, views and clicks.

Then why is that so many people complaining about it?Please stop saying it is not a problem…
People are complaining because they think the analytics display issue is related to a gigs activity in the search results and this is not true. Fiverr has said exactly this.
Those who are complaining merely because they cannot see their analytics (which are still being calculated, just not shown), have a valid complaint. Those who are complaining that they think their gigs are failing because of the analytics display issue, are merely wasting time. The two things are not related. By Fiverr’s own statement, the analytics display issue has nothing to do with gigs in the search system. I will continue to remind people that there is no search results problem, until Fiverr specifically says otherwise. I am expressing the truth, as we know it. It is not your place to demand that I do otherwise.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 1:17 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:15.220536

My point is that my sales have been really good since I started my fiverr account and they dropped at the same time Fiverr stopped showing gig impressions. Obviously I am going to think there is a correlation and so will others who are having that same issue.
And, obviously, based upon what Fiverr has said, that would be a wrong assumption.
celebrawitch:
If you aren’t having any problems and doing so well with your business, why do you have so much time to spend on the forums when the problem doesn’t even concern you?
I choose to be here, and I choose to dedicate some of my time each day to help others. I also stand against misinformation – as I have, on the forum, for years. Just because I am successful with my sales, does not mean I should stop interacting here. My continued hope is that there are people who ARE willing to listen to reason, wisdom, and my expert advice… and those who listen can become as successful as I, and other veteran sellers, have become.
In fact, over the years, many sellers have thanked me for sharing my advice and insight here on the forums. I am honored to have been a part of the success many other former new sellers are now experiencing. If YOU don’t want to listen, that’s fine… clearly you don’t want to be helped right now.
celebrawitch:
Perhaps you shouldn’t give unsolicited advice when you don’t even know someone’s situation.
That’s the thing, though, in large part, I DO know the situations of most who are complaining. I’ve been here for years, and I have seen just about everything. I have also experienced what the loud voices are complaining about, and I have learned from those experience. It would be wonderful it those who are complaining about things that aren’t even true, would stop and look at the situation objectively, and realize that what they are doing is expending needless energy that could be better invested in becoming better sellers.
celebrawitch:
I did not need your patronizing reply.
And I, respectfully, don’t need you to be telling me not to stand up for reason, and voice an alternate perspective of things. This is a discussion forum… a civil discourse. If you want to believe what isn’t true, that’s fine, but it is not appropriate for you to say that I cannot oppose that misinformation.
I’m here to help those who are willing to listen.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 1:50 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:16.057702

Fiverr to tell sellers the whole truth about the issues they are facing?
Why do you assume Fiverr is lying? What reason would they have to lie about the search system? They’re not going to tell how HOW it works (that is proprietary information), so what do you hope to get out of this argument? Fiverr says the system is working, and gigs are still interacting in the system as they are supposed to… It is not broken merely because some sellers currently have their gigs in rotation, and don’t like it. I’ve had my gigs in rotation many times too, and yet, here I am… finding ways to earn sales. My gigs have bounced back numerous times. Yours will too.
bodmas:
what are you trying to achieve or your aim?
I have explained my aim in my previous post.
bodmas:
You expect Fiverr to say there is a search results issue till you believe…
I trust Fiverr, because there is no reason not to. Even when things aren’t going my way, I work on my gigs, I market, I promote, and I do what I need to do to remain relevant and successful. Complaining achieves nothing. Actions to better a struggle do.
bodmas:

Very well. Be emotional. That doesn’t, however, make you right, when Fiverr has already stated the nature of the situation, and that it does not affect what you and others are complaining about.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 2:06 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:16.469869

This was the case everything was started. It seems like most of the sellers who had this experience on April 29th cannot remember it anymore. According to my opinion some sellers like me are still getting zero impressions, though the stats are not shown (though fiverr says it’s only a display issue, it’s not like that for the sellers who had this experience since April 29th). Zero impressions probably affect for the gig ranking. Sellers who didn’t experience the zero impression situation are not affected and their gigs are appearing on the search results as usual.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/4/5/4/454f2c6f68b463882714cb8850a1a5e47a4fefeb.jpeg,"May 22, 2020 2:24 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:17.304153

I have seen your reply comments in every thread.
This would be another emotion-based opinion. I don’t comment on every thread. I would guess that my comments are on less than 1% of all new topics on the forum. I pick and choose which discussions I participate in. Please don’t make assumptions like this.
top_engineer:
But all your comments shows that you have no any experience about this Zero impression situation started from April 29.
Actually, if you took the time to read my comments, you would see that I have stated – many times – that I have experienced – many times over the years – EXACTLY what you are complaining about. Your complaints are nothing new, just as what you are experiencing is nothing new.

I’ve asked him if its a natural rotation or really a bug, because the rotation happened at the same time the gig analytics went offline. I’m still in doubt but I trust my friend about this, he said there’s a time that our gig will be on the last page for maybe a month, but it’ll go back as it is, and fiverr will give you a chance to shine again. I hope this comment will help ease my fellow freelancers. and I hope we can get back to the track as soon as possible. Cheers to us! and Godbless to us all.

Those who do not wish to accept facts/truth/how Fiverr works, are not likely to feel at ease. Let’s all just be patient, and let Fiverr fix the display error when they are able to fix it.

This is because Fiverr gig rotation is based on the information fed into it by the gig analytics.
Hi, I don’t think this is exactly correct 100%. Maybe somewhat but there are other things involved too.
There is that little thing called THE ALGORITHM which probably takes a lot of other things into account.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 10:16 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:24.707883

I have seen a gig with 1star review on the first page of a niche in Fiverr. First page with 1 star review and 1 order for weeks.
I have noticed a lot of new gigs on the first page now too. It’s impossible to figure out how gigs are rotated.
Clearly there is much more than gig analytics determining where gigs are placed. Because those gigs must have terrible analytics aside from massive impressions which who knows why they deserve that.
I’ve seen new gigs without orders which never get orders stay on the first page month after month for no reason I could see, then later the person became a top rated seller, so there are things which fiverr likes about a gig that have nothing to do with how many orders it gets, or how new it is.",N/A,"May 22, 2020 10:19 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:25.079579

Yes. However, impressions do not stay the same. They move up and down. Also, I’ve seen that simply editing a gig will set it back in the ranks. So to say you edit a gig trying to get more impressions would, based on my own experience, tend to backfire and do the opposite of what you hope for.

There are a lot of opinions about what is going on, so rather than sharing my opinion I’ll share my experience.
I originally saw my impressions drop to 0 randomly after having climbed up to around 90 a day beginning around the 28th of April.
I have had my most productive month-long period so far from halfway through April to about a week ago, with 27 orders overall and around 13 inquiries per day. I was getting so many orders that I marked myself as “out of office” for the better part of a week and a half to slow down. When I came back, my first day began with about 4 new inquiries and nothing else. Since then, I have received absolutely nothing, no messages or orders from new buyers (I’ve had two messages from returning buyers but no orders).
That is my experience. I’ve found my gig on the very last page of search results for about a week, so it’s searchable, but almost impossible to find.
As for my opinion, I want to believe it’s the system glitching but I’m just not sure. I heard there was a gig rotation around the same time so it might just be that. Nevertheless, I feel like an international company should be able to have fixed this glitch within a few days, let alone a month. Being new to Fiverr, I’m really not in much of a position to criticize, but I really hope this is a fluke and not how Fiverr normally operates, keeping us all in the dark like this.
If anyone more experienced has info on how Fiverr normally works it would be much appreciated! Have a great day/night everyone",N/A,"May 24, 2020 11:26 pm",2020-09-06 15:31:39.417732

Hello, you may have shot yourself in the foot by going out of office for a week and a half. I’m just guessing but that can sometimes lead to a slowdown in orders when you come back.
You also mentioned April 28 which seems to be about the time others report a slowdown. So it’s not possible to tell what happened in any particular case.
My theory is that there has been such an influx of new sellers that things are being adjusted to account for that.
If you check the number of sellers in any category now you will probably see a staggering amount of new sellers.
It’s a highly competitive site now. What the secret is to getting more impressions and visibility no one knows.",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:31 am",2020-09-06 15:31:39.803440

I am a bit confused by how you handle this issue. As you can imagine, displaying gig statistics is quite an important functionality for any fiverr seller on your platform. You even promote it as one of the basic functionalities of fiverr in your eLearning videos. And this is sure true as interpreting and reacting to gigs analytics data may have direct impact on the received orders.
Mistakes can happen and problems pop up every now and then in any company but I am left rather speechless how you handle this incident.
First, there is no transparent communication on this issue beside this orange box, which is telling the obvious, i.e. that the gigs statistics are not displayed and that you are working on it. But common, you have a blog, why not use it to communicate with your customers? Why are the gigs stats down? Have you been hacked? Did someone press delete accidentally? Did a server go down? How is the progress of fixing the issue so far? Anything?!
Instead people have to search through the forums for a thread, which is not even marked sticky, but people actually have to search for it. On top, the thread basically says the same as the orange box and is flooded by repeating questions of your customers. This is a pretty bad communication Fiverr team.
Moreover, asking in the forums, I was merely pointed to this thread, which doesn’t provide any information at all, instead of answering my questions, which are rather legit to most of us. On top, without having a chance to reply my thread was closed? Pretty strange way of addressing legit requests of your customers.
I hope you can use this current challenge to heavily improve the way you communicate incidents with your customers.
Happy to receive your feedback.
Cheers,
André",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:46 am",2020-09-06 15:31:40.173905

We sellers have to work with the changes that come along and do the best we can.

thanks! Actually, it is not about sharing secrets at all. it is about communication. Incident response and incident response communication are standard processes of any company. It is not a binary decision to either publicly disclose non-secret data or not disclose anything because internal processes might be affected. In both cases, transparent communication is key.
I am not saying that the public should decide how the side is run. It is really just about communicating issues that affect the platform as a whole to its customers. I think this is a basic process for any company like mentioned above.
Best,
André",N/A,"May 25, 2020 4:55 am",2020-09-06 15:31:40.923484

I’m taking a stab in the dark here that the two things (metrics not showing AND search visibility down) are actually two separate incidents.
I rarely use the metrics side of things as I personally feel that I can’t change it based on those graphs and in most cases never corrolate with the oprders that I’m getting based on impressions etc.
In terms of the search visibility I think that they’ve probably made their search algorithm a little too harsh on some ranking factors hence why peoples searches are down. Although this isn’t Google (which has over 200 separate ranking factors) it still is a search engine and needs to be twaked periodically.
Judging by the influx of questions regarding this I feel it needs to be tweaked again.
As for my gigs visibility? It seems that my orders are fluctuating between getting a big fat 0 per day to up to 10 per day.

Fiverr planned IT maintenance for certain date and time. As far as I know and some people confirmed in forum the maintenance has not happened yet. Fiverr did not communicate any further about it. Not good.
Fiverr announced N/A in analytics long time ago and confirmed they are going to fix it. A lot of people who are also not genius like me suppose that it should have been already fixed. Fiverr does not communicate any progress, anything about it. Not good.

I’m in complete agreeance with you. As a Level 2 Seller with 200+ reviews on this specific gig alone, it doesn’t seem logical (or fair but we won’t go into that) that “randomly” my Best Selling gig would lose it’s search authority to instead preference gigs with limited credibility.
I read one post that possibly they’ve skewed the algorithm to favor new Sellers amidst the COVID-19 crisis? While in a way I understand the logic, I too spent nearly a year putting my blood, sweat and tears into creating something sustainable out of this gig - proving my capabilities, commitment to customer service, etc.
If this is an intentional shift in the algorithm, it is disappointing that Fiverr would do wrong by loyal Sellers, who too are struggling through this humanitarian and economic crisis. May I ask if this is an issue you might recommend inquiring further with customer service about? I’ve tried politely, but receive a blanket response re: display issue.

. I don’t know How they became Top Rated Seller If they Don’t Understand a Basic Thing.
@vidvox The thing about this forum is that it’s normal for people to have different opinions. That does NOT mean you get to insult them or talk badly about them if you don’t agree with them.
I don’t need to come here and try to explain things to people. I don’t get paid for this. I do it because of the misguided idea that people like you might learn something. What do I get out of this discussion? Nothing at all.
Someone might say to themselves, she has been here over 7 years, does pretty good here. So maybe she is trying to tell us something we don’t know.
But instead of that all anyone keeps saying is
WAA WAA WAAAAAH my gigs arent’ showing, I’m not getting orders, it’s from the statistics not showing when will it be fixed WAAAHHHH!
I’m finally convinced that some can’t learn, can’t understand, can’t see or take in any new things that someone says to them. It’s not possible.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:46 am",2020-09-06 15:31:57.765079

I would also really like to see my stats but even without them I can say that I have a satisfactory number of orders and I’m here for 20-25 days. I only saw my stats once before it got broken and they were really discouraging but they didn’t mean a lot.
So listen to seniors and try to understand what are they saying, they rarely say something straight to the point but let you think about it and find solution for your problem with their guidance.

They understand that there’s a problem. Nobody is denying that there’s a problem with display.
However, just because some sellers are not getting messages/orders since that problem started, doesn’t mean that not getting orders is related to the display error.

Honestly, I rarely change it, and I know that causes me to drop back in rankings. When I do though, it’s important for me to see how that affects changes in the long run as, like I said, my gig is niche. I understood that going in. The only thing I can use to evaluate the interest (note that I’m not saying success) is in analytics, as my sales aren’t frequent enough to give good data.
I wonder if this whole argument is just the difference in perspectives. For those who have a steady stream of sales, the analytics page is essentially useless. You know sales are going to come in and your gig is running like a well-oiled machine; what’s the point of checking impressions, then?
For those who don’t expect many sales (like me), the analytics data actually serve a role as they’re an important indicator of interest. I only get a few sales a month, which I’m fine with, so I need to rely on other indicators for gig performance. They’re not perfect, but it generally helps me predict if a sale is coming or if my ads on other sites are actually driving traffic to my gig.
Of course, there are plenty of new recruits who are using analytics as a source of hope, and that’s where a lot of problems come up, as they’re not entirely reliable and don’t guarantee anything.",N/A,"May 26, 2020 7:01 pm",2020-09-06 15:32:06.143040

My theory is that if your gigs can have a way to stand out somehow from the rest in a good way then you won’t need the analytics, for those who are in a highly competitive group of sellers. That way might simply be having outstanding talent.
If a seller has been plodding along with bad graphics and a gig that doesn’t stand out somehow from the rest and getting impressions and sales they’ve been very lucky.

I totally agree with this. When my gig was getting almost around 2-3 orders a day, I didn’t give my analytics any attention. However, now I haven’t gotten any orders in the past 2 weeks and it would be incredibly useful to see if there was a drop in impressions or the same amount of impressions, just nobody is inquiring (which I could use to adjust my gig accordingly.)

I haven’t gotten any orders in the past 2 weeks and it would be incredibly useful to see if there was a drop in impressions or the same amount of impressions, just nobody is inquiring (which I could use to adjust my gig accordingly.)
I would hazard a guess that your impressions have gone way down if you stopped getting orders, if you regularly got orders before.
I can tell where my gig is located approximately and how many impressions it gets by how many messages and orders I get.
Impressions are not the whole story since you can get a lot of very low quality impressions, where your gig is actually being displayed, but not in a place anyone is looking for it to buy it.
It’s always possible that you can have lots of impressions without any sales if your gig is shown only to a certain demographic, certain country, certain out of the way place, where it is assured it won’t get sales.
We all would like our gigs to be shown mostly in one or two countries known to represent the most buyers but it’s possible to have it displayed where no one ever wants it also. Fiverr is good at showing impressions where it’s not going to get many sales sometimes as part of it’s rotation.

Of course, I get what you’re saying. I think I meant to say it would be helpful to see all the analytics, such as clicks combined with impressions, so that I could tell people if were clicking but being turned away by my gig description or something. I don’t see why they would, it’s worked fantastic in the past… but who knows. (EDIT: Just read your edit, I see how it could also be the competition showing up)

Thank you for saying that, that makes a lot of sense.
I also read something about “the curse of the Level 1 seller” where apparently once people reach Level 1 their orders slow dramatically or just flat out stop. Not sure how accurate that is hahah, nor if it would affect me (I qualify for Level 1 but am waiting on the evaluation.) I think everything just came together at the very wrong time, with my almost-leveling up, plus the bug, plus all the new sellers, plus the rotation, plus me having been out of office recently… really killed my momentum hahah. But, listening to what you’ve said has given me hope for the future so thanks a ton for talking with me

Because you are doing well thats why you dont need to check your gig stats
I never checked my gig stats them when I was a newbie, either.
I figured there were more important things to be done like fine-tuning my gig, creating new gigs, and reading everything I could on the Forum about how to do so.
I also listened to the advice of the Forum member who had much knowledge to share. I honestly have not missed seeing my gig stats.
Besides as Fiverr says, No worries - your Gigs are active, and all the metrics are calculated as usual. And I find that to be true because I continue to get orders from new buyers and my regulars alike.
Maybe those who see a dip in their orders and such should think about how to improve their profile and gigs rather than blaming the inability to see their gig metrics.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:36 am",2020-09-06 15:32:16.286513

most of the sellers complaining about the display error, are also the same sellers that aren’t taking any productive ACTIONS to become successful.
Looks like you have checked out all those sellers to arrive at this conclusion.
It’s crazy how someone who is not a fiverr staff nor a fiverr web developer or site engineer seems to know how fiverr works. Since 2014 when I signed up, there has always been gig stats. Fiverr can say things to save face or calm people, but don’t try to make others look stupid.
Everyone has a right to say what they are experiencing. Just don’t tell them nothing is wrong or they shouldn’t talk about it or that what they say doesn’t matter. It doesn’t make sense. You might think you are trying to make sense, but you are not.
Stop acting like you are being paid to say these things. You know nothing if you are not a fiverr employee. Your experience or how long you have been here doesn’t matter in this type of issue. Take a break!",N/A,"May 27, 2020 4:55 pm",2020-09-06 15:32:19.365233

This is now at least the 10th time I have checked people’s gigs in the listings and found them listed among those complaining. Only 2 out of the 10 I’ve checked did indeed have their gigs not appearing in the listings.

With these replies, I could swear that there are 2-3 people getting paid to calm people down because of the panic this bug is creating.
As I said earlier, the gigs stopped rotating and you might be lucky to be on the first or second page when it stopped. However, there are people stuck on the last page.
I receive atleast two messages on Fiverr everyday and ever since this bug started, I have received 0. 0. I have like 5 friends on Fiverr that the same has happened to. Either their gigs disappeared to the last page or they can’t even find their gigs anymore. On the other hand , you will find gigs with 1 star reviews , 2 star reviews on the first page. And these gigs have been on the first page for weeks now. That would never happen if everything was normal.
Yes you’re lucky, your gigs are working fine because the platform collapsed when you were on the first page or so, but you can’t use your own privileges to downplay what everyone else is going through. That makes no sense at all.
As it has been said repeatedly here, if it was a just a display issue, Fiverr would have solved it in a day. IT IS WAY MORE THAN THAT. The N/A bug has messed up the algorithm but Fiverr won’t tell us that because that will make them lose people.
Waking up to see replies dismissing everyone’s claims as “illogical” or just replying with “Fiverr has already said it doesn’t affect so it doesn’t ” make me sick.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 5:22 pm",2020-09-06 15:32:20.528866

I could’ve easily just told you that there’s a large amount of people who aren’t having much of a financial problem through this pandemic.
We are also speaking of online traffic, I think it is more than fair to say that it should be much higher since most people are in their homes throughout the pandemic.
Many countries have also opened tattoo shops, my country included. Which would suggest more online traffic.
Lastly, there are multiple people with the same problem. They are not all in the Tattoo Design category.
The problem I see within this thread is that there are people with serious issues on their gig and the people that aren’t experiencing it are the first to call it out as something that isn’t true.
There is obviously a larger issue at hand.",N/A,"Jul 14, 2020 9:21 am",2020-09-06 15:32:31.268981

Right on!
Especially sellers who have a track record and a reasonably low cancellation rate.
I’ve had people who didn’t want to pay for what they are asking, ordering one thing, but sending specs/scripts for things WAY outside the price of the gig they ordered.
I cancel on them, they order again a week later.
My cancellation rate is around 3% over 3000+ gigs. There are a few buyers who I won’t work with anymore, but they try to order occasionally. (I had one guy send me the same order via different accounts… )
Thankfully I don’t have many of those problem buyers. Most of my repeat buyers are wonderful.

I’m a new seller here, after months of not getting orders I finally made a breakthrough and things were looking up. My clients were happy and left fantastic reviews. Then it happened… a 4 star rating from a new buyer which just reduced my overrall rating to 98%. The buyer actually said he liked my work and thinks that I’m an excellent designer blah blah but still left 4 stars for all, communication etc. It just does not make sense, gave no opportunity to me to remedy even. When I asked if there was a problem… the buyer said, no problems just it was not perfect but its ok… What?? sigh Now I am worried he will order again and just keep leaving low ratings just because he feels like it. They don’t understand how Fiver works that reputation really matters here. I still left him a 5 star review as I did not want to indulge in a tit-for-tat loop with buyers generally… in the end I know, I will be the one to suffer. Sadly, there is no option to block future orders from this buyer… so I guess, I will be at their mercy.

I’m not interested in who doesn’t read the entirety of the content. I’ll be the first to admit that some of my musings are inappropriately long. In the grand scheme of things, it’s just some forum post. It doesn’t need a vote. I’m here often enough that you can choose to skip passed my ramblings if they don’t float your boat.
On the other hand…boy, am I here a lot. I do a lot of back end reading and dig through old posts whenever some random, yet to be researched by me, topic strikes my fancy. Because I’m here so often - I choose to offer a specifically different tonal approach from the traditionally condensed forum offerings.
I’d hope that the forum mainstays… people that spend a large portion of their day hopping in and out of the topics… I hope they view my illogical, never ceasing, head splattering, choose-your-own-adventure narratives as a comedic rest from the barrage of similar topics and retorts.
In the case of this topic, I found it interesting and I agreed. I thought it to be more entertaining if I did so with a story…rather than a “me too.” Either way, my “take” on the issue doesn’t sway any balance or mean a thing more to the issue.

I had a similar instance with a customer that said, ""revisions equate to lower stars.""
That’s a fine standard to have…if you’ve come to believe that working harder is somehow lesser than, but the weird catch to this gig was his revision. He wanted the volume on his custom song louder. He liked the song, I nailed every detail that he was after and he raved about the quality.

He gave his feedback, I made changes accordingly and delivered just before the 24 hour deadline. He accepted the delivery and did not ask for a revision and just punished me with 4* rating. When I asked why did I get 4*? was there a problem with the files… his reply was "" its important for you to understand that the rating does not mean there is a problem, its just not perfect but its ok"" I don’t get it, why not just ask for a revision to make it perfect, he had no trouble asking for revisions in the previous order and I would have done it gladly. Let’s face it, ratings/reviews is just an easy way to punish sellers, but that’s always the case in any marketplace where you have to deal with customers. Yes, customer is always right, yes… seller must succumb (for reputation sake), buyer’s gets a freebie or store credit etc, rinse and repeat. It’s just the way it is (unless of course you have Swifty on speed dial) Unfortunately, there is no comeback for a bad review, your ratings take a dive and it stays forever.

The buyer actually said he liked my work and thinks that I’m an excellent designer blah blah but still left 4 stars for all, communication etc.
We all get a few of those. Don’t stress over a 4 star rating. Just keep building and getting mostly 5 stars. Note that having a 4 star rating actually gives you MORE credibility with some buyers. If you’re new and they are all 5 star, many will assume it’s your friends and family ordering. A 4 star is a real buyer.
Move on: Improve your service, refine your deliveries, and keep getting better at what you do. Most of us can continue to improve, no matter how many 5 star orders we have delivered.
If you get 1 or 2 star ratings more than once every few hundred orders, THEN you have a major issue. Also note: If you do enough, you’ll also get a 1 star rating at some point.
Someone will want something for nothing, and you will not do it, and take the one star because you did the work. You’ll get paid and move on. You want to keep those to maybe one in five hundred.

Fiverr Ambassador",0,"Hi there!
To my knowledge this isn’t actually an error but is happening because funds clearing at this point on your account would actually be clearing in the new year - 2017.
As the mobile app defaults to the current year, you wouldn’t see them there.
The desktop has the 2016 filter set by default. Change this to 2017 and you will see the information you require regarding clearing times.
Hope this helps

EDIT:
AAANNND an update… I’ve just checked the desktop browser platform and there is a problem with the revenues page (although the language is fine). Usually you have a little countdown bar showing how long it is until the revenue for an order clears but although my ‘pending clearance’ balance at the top is right - there is only a status bar for an order that was marked complete BEFORE the scheduled maintenance a little while ago.
This is a much bigger problem than the language issue because I need to know when I can expect to be able to withdraw funds so that I can schedule the paying of my bills etc. accordingly. And this feature is not available on either of the apps so it is highly frustrating!! Please fix the Revenues page and quickly because I would be very ticked off if it turns out that there is also a problem with the Withdraw feature!!
P.S. There doesn’t seem to be a problem with any other pages/tabs.",N/A,1,"Dec 20, 2016 9:31 am",generic_user,0,"There’s a newer thread on this problem hopefully someone will message a fix or something.

There are many of us sellers who need to be contacted before an order is placed. And on the other side, there are many buyers who don’t read the gig description and just place an order right away. The result? Cancelled orders, time wasted on both ends, and similar mess. SUGGESTED SOLUTION: The seller could have a CONTACT instead of BUY option on that particular gig where he needs to be contacted. In other words the current BUY button would be replaced by a CONTACT button. So the buyer would…
Fiverr will never implement something that will slow down or prevent buyers from ordering.

When I log in it gives me multiple options, input password, code, Facebook, Google, sometimes when I am too annoyed to type the password or code I just click on Facebook and it loges me in. I also activated phone activation (they send me code as SMS). So I have multiple options to log in if one fails.
I do not know how many of these backup access options did you activate/set up.
Your only option is to contact CS about your situation and wait until they respond. But the moment you changed your email you should receive a notification on that email address to confirm the change. After that all info should go on that email.

Well, you should be lucky that is not sufficient. Not so long ago Twitter and other sites were breached and I think 100000 people accounts and passwords were compromised.

Luckily the password was for sites I really do no care if someone gains access (like CNN, news, things I log in once in two years).

Regardless, every Us citizen must fill out the W9. Please read this notice by Fiverr. The first FAQ explains it.
https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/w-9-collection
the_mad_duck:
Will my gigs be locked if I don’t complete it,
This is what the thread said
W-9 US Verification Requirement
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
the_mad_duck:
even though I don’t make enough to matter?
It does not matter if you do not make $20,000. The W9 must be filled out. Fiverr will send 1099 to the relevant tax authority only if you make $20,000.
W-9 US Verification Requirement
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.

For new sellers and people who are struggling to rank in the search, the buyer request section is essential to get that first order or get back on tracks. And when you don’t get any orders, it can be tempting to quit. The buyer request section is terrible but it can be much better and efficient by changing a few things.
We are sick of writing proposals and then not hearing anything back from them. It’s because there are way too many offers sent to buyer requests which makes it harder for the buyers to choose and may lead them to not even choosing at all. Moreover, it wastes a lot of time for both, the buyers and the sellers. The competition is very high which makes the buyers want more for less money and it makes some sellers reduce and undersell their services and it decreases the overall value or price of that service for everyone and then everyone has to decrease their prices to $5. The seller to buyer ratio is very different and there are way too many sellers on Fiverr. Sellers can get anxious and even depressed when they don’t get orders. Furthermore, buyers and sellers might turn to other sites and start working there.
Here are the necessary solution and changes to alter buyer requests significantly.
Limit the number of offers that can be sent to a buyer request to 30 to 50 maximum.
Decrease the number of offers a seller can send to 3 or 5 per day. Or charge a little for every sent offer.
Categorize requests to be in entry-level, intermediate, and expert, and have different minimum prices for each one to avoid underselling services.
Check the buyer requests and make sure it’s not spam.
Make rules regarding buyer requests.
Advertise Fiverr more for buyers than for sellers to have a good buyer to seller ratio.
These are some changes which will alter the buyer request section but there might be some changes that I have not mentioned here, if you think there is one, please share it!
Fiverr will probably not make any changes to improve the buyer request section unless we ask them to.
And we can do that together by:
1.submitting a suggestion 4 and asking them to alter the buyer request section.
2. Liking this post or creating a new topic about the buyer request section.
3. Sharing your suggestions and opinions.

They already have more sales. Buyers are there and coming. Sellers are multiplying faster than the buyers, but that does not affect Fiverr not one single bit since the buyers are there.
So 2010 10 buyers - 5 sellers great
2015 10 buyers - 20 sellers okidoki
2020 10 buyers - 180000 sellers…

The BRs you don’t win DO sell.
You know why it’s especially hard for you to get BRs? Because there are more sellers than buyers and competition is high.
The problem is not that there aren’t enough sellers and nothing you propose changes the way competition works here.
As others have said Fiverr has no incentive to do what you propose. It’s not their problem you don’t win BRs and Fiverr isn’t a charity for making sure people get sales opportunities.

Terrible, awful practice. I’m glad Fiverr doesn’t do that and hope they never will.

I’d assume they already do that as much as they can. But how would you differentiate between sellers and buyers when setting a target for your promo? Anyone who sees Fiverr’s ad can be interested in buying one thing and selling something else. There’s little control over what they’ll do with their account after they find out about Fiverr. The whole system allows any of us to buy and sell at the same time at any point.
Basically you’re saying that it’s hard to get sales for some people and they might want to leave the platform. Then you suggest changes that would make sellers want to leave and still not get them any sales.
The issue is seller to buyer ratio, you mentioned that aswell. Why not let some of them leave then? No need to fix anything for that.",N/A,"Aug 31, 2020 5:56 pm",2020-09-06 15:35:30.051512

And we can do that together by:
1.submitting a suggestion 4 and asking them to alter the buyer request section.
2. Liking this post or creating a new topic about the buyer request section.
3. Sharing your suggestions and opinions.
Thank you very much for being with me until here!",N/A,2,"Aug 31, 2020 3:04 pm",contractchecker,1,"I get a lot of my business responding to buyers. I have good letters of introduction. I have a good semi-automated system of responding. I usually respond to the maximum of 10 per day.
I find the 10 limit very annoying.
And at the moment I have been bumped down from level 2 to level 0 because of silly cancellations so I am only offered very few buyer requests. And my gigs are very restricted. I just have to do no business for several months until my level gets up again.",N/A,"Aug 31, 2020 6:47 pm",2020-09-06 15:35:30.418776

For new sellers and people who are struggling to rank in the search, the buyer request section is essential to get that first order or get back on tracks. And when you don’t get any orders, it can be tempting to quit. The buyer request section is terrible but it can be much better and efficient by changing a few things.
We are sick of writing proposals and then not hearing anything back from them. It’s because there are way too many offers sent to buyer requests which makes it harder for the buyers to choose and may lead them to not even choosing at all. Moreover, it wastes a lot of time for both, the buyers and the sellers. The competition is very high which makes the buyers want more for less money and it makes some sellers reduce and undersell their services and it decreases the overall value or price of that service for everyone and then everyone has to decrease their prices to $5. The seller to buyer ratio is very different and there are way too many sellers on Fiverr. Sellers can get anxious and even depressed when they don’t get orders. Furthermore, buyers and sellers might turn to other sites and start working there.
Here are the necessary solution and changes to alter buyer requests significantly.
Limit the number of offers that can be sent to a buyer request to 30 to 50 maximum.
Decrease the number of offers a seller can send to 3 or 5 per day. Or charge a little for every sent offer.
Categorize requests to be in entry-level, intermediate, and expert, and have different minimum prices for each one to avoid underselling services.
Check the buyer requests and make sure it’s not spam.
Make rules regarding buyer requests.
Advertise Fiverr more for buyers than for sellers to have a good buyer to seller ratio.

Fiverr should make changes if it can improve something.,N/A,"Sep 1, 2020 12:42 am",2020-09-06 15:35:31.176718
