It’s a great idea, because it will bring more traffic and revenue to the platform - If a certain service that a buyer saved gets discounted, a notification about the discount will appear. This way, the seller that decided to discount his gig will reach all the people that were already interest in his gig so he’ll definitely be getting new orders and the buyers will be able to get the service they wanted for a cheaper price (As they probably couldn’t afford it at the time).

So i initiated a withdrawal from fiverr through PAYPAL and i got an email from paypal to claim my money. At that time my kyc for receiving local and global payments was not submitted and they said its not verified. (I messaged the paypal cs). Also i got an email from paypal saying they are waiting for me to submit a few missing documents inorder to deposit the fund(the kyc and i got to know it only after a lot of researching). And if its not verified the fund gets reversed to the sender(FIverr) in 1 month time. The problem is i have submitted all my kyc after this email and after 2 days from my withdrawal initiated. Now the Paypal asks me to contact fiverr and resend the payment once again, Which i dont know how it becomes possible. This is my first paypal transaction and would appreciate it if anybody has the solution to this. Fiver earnings shows withdrawal initiated and deducted the money- The paypal button is greyed out showing withdrawal in progress- the WITHDRAWN tab has $0 as it doesnt display the amount withdrawn which i think is due to the incomplete transaction. The only solution i see as of now is wait for 30 days to reverse the fund in fiverr again and then initiate withdrawal again. Is there anything i am missing here or can anything else be done to receive my money sooner before this 30 day wait as im in urgent need of it. I’d appreciate if anybody can help.
