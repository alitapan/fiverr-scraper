a.) It’s very small. If you type out a few paragraphs, you can barely see anything.
b.) If you then scroll in it, it scrolls way too fast. This is connected with c.)
c.) Selecting text with the mouse will result in very annoying, fast scrolling; refer to b.)
d.) It should be expandable, like the reddit text box, for example. There’s a small arrow-like thingy at the bottom right edge that allows you to adjust the size of the text box you are typing in.
Point d.) technically also applies to this forum’s text box, but it’s much better handled here. I have no issues when typing in this text box. Wonderful.
The above described issues really give the customer a poor user experience when placing orders. In some cases, there are multiple boxes that let you type up to 2500 characters. Sometimes you need all that space to accurately describe what you need.

eg. Fiverr takes a service charge ($2 on purchases up to and including $40, and 5% on purchases above $40)+20% of the fee from orders, but the actual costs to Fiverr for handling any issues with orders won’t double with a gig that is double price.

Regular",4,"I imagine that the people who lost sales the most were ones that had gigs priced at $5-10. Out of a $5-10 order a 2 buck fee is unquestionably very high. For sellers who make most sales on orders starting at $15-25 or more, I don’t think the impact is as bad. The more the buyer spends, the less the fee seems that bad.
I think in some ways that may have boosted sellers with higher prices but I am still against the fee on principle. I don’t mind there being a fee that is a percentage of an order, but I’d like to see it be balanced better allowing for some cheaper gigs.
My sales went up after the fee, but like Vickie, I stopped getting tips for the most part. My extras also do not sell after an order due to the fee.",N/A,"Nov 17, 2018 10:27 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:21.823462

If you did the work as requested, and according to the terms of your gig, don’t cancel. It’s as simple as that. Refuse to cancel work that has been completed as promised. You’ve been around for a few years, so I assume you already know the part in Fiverr’s TOS that states that orders are not eligible to be cancelled based on personal preference, if they were delivered according to the terms of your gig.
alpi123:
What if someone deliberately orders a gig from you just so that he can cancel it afterwards and practically try to destroy your career ?
Say no, and report the questionable cancellation attempt to Fiverr. You always have a say in cancellation demands from buyers. Say, “no”, and let your “no”, be “no”.
alpi123:
I have no clue why the buyer couldn’t just send me his file to me before ordering.
Because it isn’t required. Fiverr is set up in such a way that everything a buyer needs to know about your service is listed on your gig packages, and in your gig description. Buyers are not required to contact you, before choosing one of your listed packages, and hiring you to complete it.
The questions that buyers have to answer before the order goes active has plenty of options to require the buyer to provide information and attachments that you would need to complete the order.",N/A,"Aug 13, 2020 9:03 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:52.436048

Yep, that’s what I think. I totally agree that orders that are not covered in the gig, or people chose wrong gig package and don’t want to add more, or when buyer changed their mind couple of hours after ordering etc should not affect our stats.

I see a lot of people here on the forum complaining that they delivered as client asked but client is unsatisfied and wants to cancel and still should not affect their stats because it’s unfair.

I also ask to be contacted prior to ordering. Usually they do, but in the past 4 days I’ve had two people place an order, and within a few hours ask to cancel it, before work was even started.
This person ordered a 500 word rewrite, sent 1,200 words and when I asked if they wanted the rewritten version reduced or add an extra gig I received “I didn’t know you were going to charge more, please cancel.”
This one occurred earlier today. They ordered a rush delivery, an hour later after I had assigned it they asked to cancel because of a budgeting issue on their end… Gah!
Due to the lack of work the past few months with the whole COVID thing, the first cancelation dropped me 5%, from 94% to 89% … I’m waiting to see if there’s any way to avoid canceling this 2nd one because that will drop me to 84% and my completion rating has never been that low in the 6+ years providing services here.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 9:00 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:57.744861

Although, I would assume that’s rare (I think it’s happened twice in 6 years).
When it comes to canceling vs risking feedback I usually base it on two factors:
How much time was spent on the order?
How much is the order for?
If very little time was spent on the order, or it’s a small value order I usually just refund. Assuming we are getting a regular flow of orders, and the rareity of an unsatisifed client, the cancellation does not usually affect our stats much.
However, there has been times when my team has spent dozens of hours on an order and the client waited until we delivered all the work to complain, and continued to complain after several rounds of revisions. In this case, I said ‘no’ as alpi123 up there mentioned doing. BUT…
Saying no only dragged it out. Although we delivered as stated in our gig description, provided several rounds of revisions, and reporting it - Fiver Support took it upon themselves to cancel the order (almost a month later).
While we should have the right to say ‘no’ to a refund/cancellation, ultimately Fiverr seems to favor the buyer for some reason.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 9:09 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:58.083737

Last week one customer try to cancel an order. Do you now why? Because I just suggest something to improve the jingle (even more than my Gig offer) .
I just decline this cancellation!
I told with customer and He said, ohhh sorry, I love your work but I don’t understand what you said because I have poor english…
So, after that This customer review was 5 stars.
If someone cancels an order for no reason, just decline and talk to CS.
Remember friend DO NOT CANCEL AN ORDER EVER!!!
I agree with you, I’ve been working on Fiverr by 5 years, and always click “acept” but it means that you make a mutual cancellation.
Only once in all these years a client insulted me, harassed me, told me that I had to cancel because she disgusted my “Latin music style”. So I decided to accept the cancellation because the penalty takes 3 months to resolve, but a negative evaluation REMAINS FOREVER.
So only cancel as a last resort to avoid negative evaluation.
I finally agree with you. There are clients who are acting like criminals, with bad intentions. Sellers have no way to protect ourselves from them, the only way is to “decline” and talk to CS.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 9:36 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:58.498471

I was told this by Fiverr support just today. I just posted my experience (below) in the community forum and what I was told by Fiverr:
Had a buyer who requested numerous voice recordings with music. Order was delivered and buyer changed his mind stating he decided he wants a MALE voice instead of a Female voice (me), and wants me to deliver the recordings in a male voice. My gig is very clear that it is for a female voice, no male voices are offered. Buyer wants to cancel AND GET A REFUND because he now wants a male voice instead. This order took quite a lot of time to produce and was delivered exactly as my gig described. Recordings were very high quality and professional. I have excellent reviews from all of my previous buyers. I reached out to Fiverr customer support and brought up that this buyer is violating the Terms of Service by trying to cancel after receiving the order simply because he changed his mind and wants a male voice. The gig was delivered as described. This is like hiring a contractor to remodel your kitchen, and then wanting a refund when the work is done because you changed your mind and decided you want to remodel your bathroom instead. Fiverr support replied stating that they are “sorry” for the experience, but in essence, the buyer can cancel for ANY reason . This is what they responded with:
""While we would not cancel an order based on personal taste directly, the buyer does have the final word on how their funds are spent and any reason they want to cancel an order for is valid.""
This is unacceptable to me as a seller. There is no protection for sellers who have spent a lot of time/energy on a project and makes it very easy for sellers to be taken advantage of. Time to spread the word. Anyone else have this experience?",N/A,"Sep 8, 2020 12:45 pm",2020-09-09 21:46:59.627348

There is a suggestion that i want to share with the community, specially with sellers, and I am sure that every seller on fiverr will support that and want it to be implemented.



Here it is, I suggest that why not sellers have their weekends off while their GIGs stay live.



Well! I think that fiverr should give us the option in our profile to choose whether or not we want to work on weekends,if someone opt to work on weekends thing will go as normal as it is now. On the other hand if someone want to be free or have some other things to do on weekends, he/she should have the option choose not to work on weekends. You may say that this is not a problem, we can do this by suspending our gigs for couple of days. Yes we can do that but this will also remove your gigs from listings and it means that you will be nullifying any chance of getting orders in those days and I am sure that there is not a single seller that would want that. Suspending gigs is good only if you are leaving for a longer period of time.



So the solution for the problem is that, even when we declare in our profiles that we will not work on weekends our gigs stay live, and when we get order the timer should start on next working day. fiverr is like any other business and every business have a day or two off weekly, so why not on fiverr and most importantly without the fear of loosing business (Orders).



If during some odd weekend the sellers don’t have anything else to do and wants to complete some of his orders, he should have the option to initiate the work on those orders and mark them in progress so the timer for these orders start immediately and other stay there for week days.



The option of one day or two days weekend can also given as many countries have one day weekend like we have here in Pakistan.

Fiverr can make this feature conditional like may be adding it as a 2nd level feature, it will be a great addition.



I am a terrible writer, but i tried my best to present my point clearly, I hope all members get my point and support it and will suggest fiverr to implement this.



Thanks for taking out some time to read this.

I know a lot of people think that when you suspend a gig you loose your place in search. But it’s my experience that you don’t. Maybe I’m wrong, but I suspend my gigs all the time. One of my gigs is suspended more than it is active. (When I get busy I pause the gig to catch up).



My point? I’ve never lost my place in the search results.

Suspending gigs is good only if you are leaving for a longer period of time.



So the solution for the problem is that, even when we declare in our profiles that we will not work on weekends our gigs stay live, and when we get order the timer should start on next working day. fiverr is like any other business and every business have a day or two off weekly, so why not on fiverr and most importantly without the fear of loosing business (Orders).



If during some odd weekend the sellers don’t have anything else to do and wants to complete some of his orders, he should have the option to initiate the work on those orders and mark them in progress so the timer for these orders start immediately and other stay there for week days.



The option of one day or two days weekend can also given as many countries have one day weekend like we have here in Pakistan.

Fiverr can make this feature conditional like may be adding it as a 2nd level feature, it will be a great addition.



I am a terrible writer, but i tried my best to present my point clearly, I hope all members get my point and support it and will suggest fiverr to implement this.



Thanks for taking out some time to read this.

Right on!
Especially sellers who have a track record and a reasonably low cancellation rate.
I’ve had people who didn’t want to pay for what they are asking, ordering one thing, but sending specs/scripts for things WAY outside the price of the gig they ordered.
I cancel on them, they order again a week later.
My cancellation rate is around 3% over 3000+ gigs. There are a few buyers who I won’t work with anymore, but they try to order occasionally. (I had one guy send me the same order via different accounts… )
Thankfully I don’t have many of those problem buyers. Most of my repeat buyers are wonderful.

I’m a new seller here, after months of not getting orders I finally made a breakthrough and things were looking up. My clients were happy and left fantastic reviews. Then it happened… a 4 star rating from a new buyer which just reduced my overrall rating to 98%. The buyer actually said he liked my work and thinks that I’m an excellent designer blah blah but still left 4 stars for all, communication etc. It just does not make sense, gave no opportunity to me to remedy even. When I asked if there was a problem… the buyer said, no problems just it was not perfect but its ok… What?? sigh Now I am worried he will order again and just keep leaving low ratings just because he feels like it. They don’t understand how Fiver works that reputation really matters here. I still left him a 5 star review as I did not want to indulge in a tit-for-tat loop with buyers generally… in the end I know, I will be the one to suffer. Sadly, there is no option to block future orders from this buyer… so I guess, I will be at their mercy.

Almost every day I remind myself never to try to help people.
I had decided that wow this lady is terribly ill and I never want another order from her when I had been chatting with her, but then forgot about her and she was able to place another order to turn on me as she did on everyone she ever knew.

P.S Create an anonymous poll about who read it whole.
I’m not interested in who doesn’t read the entirety of the content. I’ll be the first to admit that some of my musings are inappropriately long. In the grand scheme of things, it’s just some forum post. It doesn’t need a vote. I’m here often enough that you can choose to skip passed my ramblings if they don’t float your boat.
On the other hand…boy, am I here a lot. I do a lot of back end reading and dig through old posts whenever some random, yet to be researched by me, topic strikes my fancy. Because I’m here so often - I choose to offer a specifically different tonal approach from the traditionally condensed forum offerings.
I’d hope that the forum mainstays… people that spend a large portion of their day hopping in and out of the topics… I hope they view my illogical, never ceasing, head splattering, choose-your-own-adventure narratives as a comedic rest from the barrage of similar topics and retorts.
In the case of this topic, I found it interesting and I agreed. I thought it to be more entertaining if I did so with a story…rather than a “me too.” Either way, my “take” on the issue doesn’t sway any balance or mean a thing more to the issue.

she said she never gives 5 stars for voiceover work
I had a similar instance with a customer that said, ""revisions equate to lower stars.""
That’s a fine standard to have…if you’ve come to believe that working harder is somehow lesser than, but the weird catch to this gig was his revision. He wanted the volume on his custom song louder. He liked the song, I nailed every detail that he was after and he raved about the quality. The song was mastered to be as loud as any radio material … but different people produce to different volumes.
What I’m saying is, I got a four star rating because the buyer didn’t turn up his speakers.

In my case, I sent mockups within a few hours of the order for his feedback because I did not want to take any chances on not getting it right. He gave his feedback, I made changes accordingly and delivered just before the 24 hour deadline. He accepted the delivery and did not ask for a revision and just punished me with 4* rating. When I asked why did I get 4*? was there a problem with the files… his reply was "" its important for you to understand that the rating does not mean there is a problem, its just not perfect but its ok"" I don’t get it, why not just ask for a revision to make it perfect, he had no trouble asking for revisions in the previous order and I would have done it gladly. Let’s face it, ratings/reviews is just an easy way to punish sellers, but that’s always the case in any marketplace where you have to deal with customers. Yes, customer is always right, yes… seller must succumb (for reputation sake), buyer’s gets a freebie or store credit etc, rinse and repeat. It’s just the way it is (unless of course you have Swifty on speed dial) Unfortunately, there is no comeback for a bad review, your ratings take a dive and it stays forever.

The buyer actually said he liked my work and thinks that I’m an excellent designer blah blah but still left 4 stars for all, communication etc.
We all get a few of those. Don’t stress over a 4 star rating. Just keep building and getting mostly 5 stars. Note that having a 4 star rating actually gives you MORE credibility with some buyers. If you’re new and they are all 5 star, many will assume it’s your friends and family ordering. A 4 star is a real buyer.
Move on: Improve your service, refine your deliveries, and keep getting better at what you do. Most of us can continue to improve, no matter how many 5 star orders we have delivered.
If you get 1 or 2 star ratings more than once every few hundred orders, THEN you have a major issue. Also note: If you do enough, you’ll also get a 1 star rating at some point.
Someone will want something for nothing, and you will not do it, and take the one star because you did the work. You’ll get paid and move on. You want to keep those to maybe one in five hundred.

Yes, both audios sound the same, I check them. There is no distortion or background noise on the two recordings.
To me, French is a very interesting language so it sounds great, the color of your voice is also great, and the audio quality is very much up to standard.
I do not know what is a demand for French st the moment but I do know that people who are selling in the VO category have frequent sales.
I wanted to do VO service too since I have a professional studio microphone and setting but at the moment I am writing a book so all my focus should be on that.
Désolé pour la réponse tardive, j’ai un voisin agressif qui doit se retenir. Je menace juste d’appeler la police. Nous verrons.
Oui, les deux audios sonnent de la même manière, je les vérifie. Il n’y a pas de distorsion ou de bruit de fond sur les deux enregistrements.
Pour moi, le français est une langue très intéressante, donc ça sonne bien, la couleur de votre voix est également excellente et la qualité audio est tout à fait à la hauteur.
Je ne sais pas quelle est la demande pour le français en ce moment mais je sais que les gens qui vendent dans la catégorie VO ont des ventes fréquentes.
Je voulais aussi faire du service VO puisque j’ai un microphone et un réglage de studio professionnels, mais pour le moment j’écris un livre, donc je dois me concentrer sur cela.",N/A,"Sep 5, 2020 12:40 pm",2020-09-09 21:47:55.866915

Hi @rimounette,
I’ve listened to both of the audios and you’re right, but there’s not much you can do about it. The issue has to do with Fiverr compressing audio files, hence, distortion appears.

Please take this into consideration and do something about it. This doesn’t make a good impression on clients and is also a disadvantage for sellers.

You’re most welcome, @rimounette!
I think you’ll still be having poor audio quality, even if you just used an audio file, since the problem lies on Fiverr compressing it during upload.

I have noticed of late clients going missing for a while or not sending requested media. This is having an effect on my ability to sell and communicate with clients. At first I put it down to just language barriers, virus, mobs destroying businesses or simple misunderstanding. However a client I am in communication with now, I have noticed a missing communication I sent the client on the 6th of June. It is highly important that all communications between the seller and the buyer are on record before and during a gig purchase.
I have sent a version to the Fiverr help team to investigate, I recommend that everyone check their communications with their clients to check whether messages have gone missing, I would especially check present gigs just in case that this is a site wide bug, you can be losing clients because of none communication!!",N/A,1,"Jun 22, 2020 4:14 am",stefos,1,Will do!

I remember it being a bit slower with Payoneer when it came to getting paid. But, Fiverr has it on record, so if it’s stuck somewhere, they should be able to get it sent your way.
Have you checked your Payoneer account just in case to see if you received any messages/notifications? I’d also double check your email to see if you got anything about it.
One thing I thought of, is that maybe it’s a graphical glitch you’re seeing and the money is still there ready to be withdrawn. If so, signing out and back in might fix it. Or clearing your browser cache. To me, it sounds like it could be an issue like that, especially if you didn’t go through with the withdrawal.

From then status was “Withdraw initiated” and thats it no action after that

It’s a great idea, because it will bring more traffic and revenue to the platform - If a certain service that a buyer saved gets discounted, a notification about the discount will appear. This way, the seller that decided to discount his gig will reach all the people that were already interest in his gig so he’ll definitely be getting new orders and the buyers will be able to get the service they wanted for a cheaper price (As they probably couldn’t afford it at the time).

So i initiated a withdrawal from fiverr through PAYPAL and i got an email from paypal to claim my money. At that time my kyc for receiving local and global payments was not submitted and they said its not verified. (I messaged the paypal cs). Also i got an email from paypal saying they are waiting for me to submit a few missing documents inorder to deposit the fund(the kyc and i got to know it only after a lot of researching). And if its not verified the fund gets reversed to the sender(FIverr) in 1 month time. The problem is i have submitted all my kyc after this email and after 2 days from my withdrawal initiated. Now the Paypal asks me to contact fiverr and resend the payment once again, Which i dont know how it becomes possible. This is my first paypal transaction and would appreciate it if anybody has the solution to this. Fiver earnings shows withdrawal initiated and deducted the money- The paypal button is greyed out showing withdrawal in progress- the WITHDRAWN tab has $0 as it doesnt display the amount withdrawn which i think is due to the incomplete transaction. The only solution i see as of now is wait for 30 days to reverse the fund in fiverr again and then initiate withdrawal again. Is there anything i am missing here or can anything else be done to receive my money sooner before this 30 day wait as im in urgent need of it. I’d appreciate if anybody can help.

Actually, the idea of splitting fiction from non-fiction book editing only came to me from the incessant prompts to update my gigs and to fill out all possible information. So I was prompted to specify which kind of book I offer to edit. So it was either “generic” or just one of the two (fiction/non-fiction), which was why I then decided to split them.
It frankly seems to me a little unfair to set up the system like this, but will now be better equipped to dealing with it (after your advice).
I do find it would be helpful if duplicating would be made possible as a basis for further changes as we are all working people and this will save up quite some time. But so be it…

I don’t know why these bug keeps arriving on Fiverr even I know they keep it updating. Try to contact the CS and they will kind of reset your account and you will not face this issue hopefully.,N/A,"Sep 5, 2020 7:31 am",2020-09-09 21:50:35.007308
