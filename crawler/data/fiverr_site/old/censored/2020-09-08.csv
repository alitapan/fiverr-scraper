I mentioned that I tried to pay twice using the credit card method but I got a message saying the transaction has failed please try again.
Afterwards I tried to pay with my credit card using the Paypal method and it worked.

Anyone has had the same problem ?",,,,lishoneg,1.0,"Apparently, it’s not just me. This is ridiculous! Last week it charged my card 6 times but I couldn’t see the numbers. When I go to the payment screen I can’t see the numbers. Today I see the problem is still there but this time I’m smart enough not to put my card number in. This is madness that this has been a problem for a while. I’ve tried on Firefox, Chrome and Internet explorer and it’s the same problem.
They are NOT fixing the problem and this means lots of folks on Fiverr are losing money. Which means they Fiverr is losing money.
This problem needs to be fixed ASAP!!!",,"Aug 4, 2017 1:28 pm",2020-09-06 15:27:00.597836

I’ve already notified Fiverr support about this issue on July 18, 2020 09:33 which is almost 1.5 months now and yet no resolution, hence putting info about bug here in case I get resolution. It’s really annoying. Thank you.

I’ve already submitted a ticket to Fiverr support regarding this on May 23, 2020 and yet no results. I’m told that it’s been forwarded to Tech team.

Hope you are well,
When I open the Fiverr mobile app to see the buyer request I saw one request and there were 7 attachments.
I wanted to open the files and clarify the request then I log in to the Fiverr site via my desktop.
then I have noticed there are no 7 attachments. only one file was visible.
but in the mobile app, all files are there. also, the customer has mentioned some file names but I only see one file on the desktop view.
Please see the below image for your reference,

If you need any more details let me know. I think I can`t send the br link.
Thank you,

If I am constantly on Fiverr in my inbox responding to messages, how can I be offline for short period of time?
What qualifies as “online”, that is the question. When I am looking at my profile it says I am online, but when I am reading and responding to my messages in inbox it says I am offline.
And I just refreshed and only one of my GIGs is there. How can i be online for one gig and not for the other…funky fiverr code",,"Jul 29, 2020 7:54 am",2020-09-06 15:27:37.665552

And for that you need to know the rules if you would’ve know the rules you wouldn’t even bother to worry that someone will report you when they are the ones breaking rules.
Just read terms of services and you wouldn’t be scared anymore because you will know the rules and when you are or wrong. Fiverr doesn’t punish you if someone reported you but you haven’t done anything wrong",,"Sep 3, 2020 10:20 pm",2020-09-06 15:28:14.223039

When I log in it gives me multiple options, input password, code, Facebook, Google, sometimes when I am too annoyed to type the password or code I just click on Facebook and it loges me in. I also activated phone activation (they send me code as SMS). So I have multiple options to log in if one fails.
I do not know how many of these backup access options did you activate/set up.
Your only option is to contact CS about your situation and wait until they respond. But the moment you changed your email you should receive a notification on that email address to confirm the change. After that all info should go on that email.

Well, you should be lucky that is not sufficient. Not so long ago Twitter and other sites were breached and I think 100000 people accounts and passwords were compromised. I even received email with one of my passwords in the subject so it was not a happy day to see that breach. Luckily the password was for sites I really do no care if someone gains access (like CNN, news, things I log in once in two years).

Regardless, every Us citizen must fill out the W9. Please read this notice by Fiverr. The first FAQ explains it.

the_mad_duck:
Will my gigs be locked if I don’t complete it,
This is what the thread said
W-9 US Verification Requirement
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
the_mad_duck:
even though I don’t make enough to matter?
It does not matter if you do not make $20,000. The W9 must be filled out. Fiverr will send 1099 to the relevant tax authority only if you make $20,000.
W-9 US Verification Requirement
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.
