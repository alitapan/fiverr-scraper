My guess and tip: That¬¥s Detective Conan as your profile pic, right? If I wanted to hire someone for a cover that I want to use to sell something I made, I¬¥d not choose a seller who uses something they didn¬¥t photograph or create themselves, I¬¥d be afraid that I¬¥ll run into IP (Intellectual Property) issues with the cover they¬¥d give me. Better use a photograph or a drawing or something else you made yourself for your profile pic. And, in case you haven¬¥t yet, make sure that you have a good understanding of IP (ask google, they know not everything, but surely everything there is to know about IP), and don¬¥t use anything you don¬¥t have the relevant rights for to make things for your buyers!

What should I do ??",,,,theyellowcrow,0.0,"Hello Hammad,
Lets assume a buyer has found your gig and he wants the services which you can deliver.
(There is a lot before that, your gig should be visible, impressions, etc about which I will talk later below)
As a buyer, he will like to know that whether this person is capable enough to complete the work in a perfect way. He also needs to put some trust in you. As it was already mentioned, you need to have a great profile picture. Something which says ‚ÄòYes, I can do it‚Äô. People generally tend to trust more if they know with whom they are working with.
I am working with a buyer (still working with her, almost one year). She messaged me to work on a website. After some chat, she asked me to know how I look like. I sent her my picture. Some buyers would ask for it, other would just skip to some other gig. You don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where just because of your picture you are not getting sales. Your profile picture should work for you.
Second, ensure you have a great description. A potential buyer will definitely look into your profile before spending any money. He would be curious with whom he will be working with. It would be great if you can be specific as to what type of computer problems you can solve.
Third, re-model your gigs to make them look attractive and professional. Have a great gig gallery and also make sure to add the two PDFs. You need to market yourself as much as possible.
Now, how to get visibility?
The best way is using social media. Join Facebook groups aligning with your services and promote your gigs and services there. Your gig will automatically start to improve its health once its starts receiving the traffic.
There are specific threads on how to promote your gigs, so I will cut it short here and will not explain all of that again.
Hope this helps. Good Luck!",,"Oct 26, 2016 2:49 am",2020-08-14 22:38:52.432115

And yes, all messages on the Fiverr system are monitored for keywords. If you send a message to a buyer or seller and try to write the word, money, or email, a big red warning pops up saying you are not to contact or ask for money outside the system.



For most gigs, giving instructions via email/messages is sufficient. If you need beyond that, and to only buy from a certain time zone, maybe a traditional freelancer from the internet that is local to you might be a better option than Fiverr.

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.
Before I‚Äôll wrap up, my final question to you is: what stats would you like to see next?

There is a reason why many successful sellers post such messages on the forum. This is because ‚Äî no matter what the statistics tell, it makes ZERO sense to offer services in a category JUST because that particular category has the ‚Äúhighest sales amount‚Äù.
A seller can have many skills:
design minimalist logos (graphics & design)
work as a full-stack developer/work on selenium (programming & tech)
write articles on cryptocurrency (writing & translation)
If they are really skilled at all 3 tasks and are capable of providing top-notch services to their clients, then sure! They can make gigs in each of these categories. They can become very successful sellers on Fiverr.
Unfortunately, many sellers look for the easiest way to make money‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt want to put in the hard work/effort that‚Äôs required to deliver premium quality services/products to their customers. Instead, they find the category that is making the most money (using statistics, just like you did), create some random gig in that category, and start fooling/scamming buyers by promising them excellent products/services. They end up getting poor reviews and their orders canceled by their buyers/Fiverr. In the end, they don‚Äôt make any money; they get the boot from Fiverr. What‚Äôs the point in making such gigs (in categories making the most revenue) when sellers don‚Äôt possess the requisite skills to be the best at what they do? @the_cable_guy Do you agree?
(TL;DR): Don‚Äôt create gigs in a particular category just because you see that category making the most money. If this is your intention, statistics don‚Äôt mean anything. If you are not really skilled at a particular task (‚Äúskilled‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just mean having the technical know-how; It means being really good, if not the best, at what you do), it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to create a gig that requires you to do that task. Create gigs that revolve around your skill set and you will have the best chance at making the most money you possibly can.
Good luck!
P.S: I liked the way you presented those stats. Was easy to understand and the color combinations were not harsh on the eyes.",,"Oct 19, 2018 7:27 am",2020-08-14 22:39:31.799817

After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.
Before I‚Äôll wrap up, my final question to you is: what stats would you like to see next?

hanshuber16:
Unfortunately, many sellers look for the easiest way to make money‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt want to put in the hard work/effort that‚Äôs required to deliver premium quality services/products to their customers. Instead, they find the category that is making the most money (using statistics, just like you did), create some random gig in that category, and start fooling/scamming buyers by promising them excellent products/services. They end up getting poor reviews and their orders canceled by their buyers/Fiverr. In the end, they don‚Äôt make any money; they get the boot from Fiverr. What‚Äôs the point in making such gigs (in categories making the most revenue) when sellers don‚Äôt possess the requisite skills to be the best at what they do? @the_cable_guy Do you agree?
Totally agree. Sellers who are simply looking to make some fast cash and return sub-par work will get caught out. However, what‚Äôs been provided here is the means to making a plan, particularly if you have experience in several categories - you always start with research.

Since Fiverr (and any other respectable company) don‚Äôt disclose such information, it‚Äôs probably an estimation based on the average selling price of all gigs of a seller and the number of reviews and orders in queue. Things that, believe it or not, are not reliable.
First of all, the number of reviews don‚Äôt reflect the number of orders. And second of all, the average selling price of our gigs don‚Äôt reflect our profits. I have a 10$ gig with orders in the hundreds, even thousands. Can you possibly see that in data that ‚Äúit is accessible to anyone‚Äù? Not in a million years.
Besides, while I understand the idea of following what it works and what is wanted, you still have to follow your own natural talents and passions, otherwise why do you live? If you let go of your happiness and standards for a quick buck you will be miserable. It‚Äôs better to focus on your talents and grow from there. Expand from there. Not chase numbers.
So guess what. On the long-term, following your own dreams and talents beat the behind of any number chasing maniac. Ask Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos etc.

After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.
Before I‚Äôll wrap up, my final question to you is: what stats would you like to see next?

I don‚Äôt think this information is reliable at all. Since Fiverr (and any other respectable company) don‚Äôt disclose such information, it‚Äôs probably an estimation based on the average selling price of all gigs of a seller and the number of reviews and orders in queue. Things that, believe it or not, are not reliable.
I assume it‚Äôs from the average price of the sellers gigs multiplied by an estimate of the number of that gig that has sold based on the number of reviews. I assume an estimate of the number sold was made based on the number of reviews (eg. multiply the number of reviews by a number to get that, eg. assume only a certain percentage will leave a review).
The problem is this doesn‚Äôt tell you the actual price each gig was sold at (which could be very different from the listed price - and I assume the stats weren‚Äôt taken where it was showing a price range for each reviewed gig) like has been said. Lots of gigs also have different priced packages and it doesn‚Äôt tell you which package was sold - and it could have been sold by the user accepting an offer - the price of which wouldn‚Äôt be known publicly normally.
By ‚Äúpublicly accessible‚Äù - the only publicly accessible data (apart from eg. a past paper from 2016) about the gigs and prices is on the Fiverr website itself. Which if viewed manually (or through a means where it would appear to Fiverr that it was being viewed manually) would tell the prices etc. listed above, that are shown on the gigs and gig packages, but it wouldn‚Äôt show the actual price of the gigs sold (and normally wouldn‚Äôt show the price range).
Also, I agree with what has been said, it is best to create gigs for what you are best at but which will also likely be the most profitable, which will likely be where there isn‚Äôt a lot of competition but which is still a service that will be in demand or which enough people would pay a high enough amount for.
Though it‚Äôs interesting stats as very rough figures and it might help in deciding which categories might be best (assuming they are reasonably correct estimations - which they may not be), as long as they are ones the seller can create quality gigs in and have the necessary skills for those gigs.",,"Oct 20, 2018 3:09 am",2020-08-14 22:39:35.337200

It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do.

Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.

I am interested, hence my question, to make sure you have the actual average selling price in your stats and not a perceived one based on the gig prices.
@miiila, thank you. And yes, all the people above and you also, are right. In order to calculate the quantity of sales for the past two months I‚Äôm using the quantity of reviews. And for the amount of sales I‚Äôm using pricing available in packages of an exact gig. I totally understand that reviews are not showing all the sales, and that gig price is not showing the exact amount of the sales. But my task was to compare categories. And the numbers (with this accuracy) are showing me exactly what I‚Äôve needed.
There are also two important numbers that complement the analysis and inaccuracy in quantity and amounts of sales:
‚ÄúGigs added over the last month‚Äù - how many gigs are added by sellers in a category.
This shows me how fast a category grows.
‚ÄúThe number of sellers in the category‚Äù - how many active and unique sellers are right now in a category. In other words - how saturated the category is.
Those numbers make sense when one sees them together:
how many sales + how big is the paycheck + how many sellers there are + how many gigs is added recently = how attractive the category is right now compared to others.
As an example. Let‚Äôs look at the ‚ÄúWriting & Translation‚Äù sub-categories:
stat4.png
645√ó738 47.5 KB
‚ÄúTechnical writing‚Äù is clearly at the bottom, but the ‚Äúgigs added‚Äù is equal to the number of sales. This category is definitely a new one and is trending, sellers are trying to check how this category will work out. And the paycheck is good. Worth testing (IMHO).
Another example. Why there are only ‚Äú+26 gigs‚Äù for the last month in the ‚ÄúTranslation‚Äù category? It is very big (when compared to others). And the price is very low. My thought (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) - the category is oversaturated and there is nothing new a person can add there. Expect a heavy competition even if you are a pro- translator.
Again, those are my observations, and I‚Äôm still learning to see. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve added this post on Fiverr. I wanted to see if anyone else can find some patterns which I‚Äôm missing.
@miiila, @merciavideo, thank you again for your input, and for giving me chance to learn.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/a/f/afca3418746c6e89170ec90215cecf9d7898e676.png,"Oct 23, 2018 7:04 am",2020-08-14 22:39:41.313312

For me, for example, it would be interesting to know if/how much my own revenue per sold gig and monthly income differs from the monthly average and of course the minimum and maximum, while comparisons cross categories are less relevant for me.
But the numbers above, comparisons between subcategories within my category, are very interesting, too, thanks!
As for the translation category, there are many things that play a role which I can‚Äôt go into.
What I can say though, is that I sometimes have gigs that take me several days or whole weeks, last month, for instance, I had to go OOO for 2 weeks to do just 1 gig. Obviously, I don‚Äôt work 2 weeks for $5.
You can‚Äôt translate a book or game or even most websites in a day or two - but you‚Äôll find BRs that ask people to translate thousands of words for $5, often with a deadline that is humanly not possible to keep, even if one was desperate enough to work a whole day or two for ‚Ç¨3,68 or whatever remains after currency conversion, and they do get offers.
The price isn‚Äôt low, some people‚Äôs prices are low, but if you want a quality, manual translation by an actual native speaker and are a bit observant, you‚Äôll find out that you better get your priorities right and not necessarily take the cheapest offer. Like everywhere, there usually are reasons for things or services to be expensive or cheap.

Yea, in my opinion, they cannot be used even as a comparison, because the difference of financial earnings can be so big that the stats can be totally different.
They can be used as an inspiration though for people that are interested in offering more services than they already do. But please don‚Äôt take it as for sure, if that category has many millions in stats doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs 100% profitable in reality. Especially because it might not be profitable for a certain person that is not meant for that domain.
You had some solid points otherwise.
In other words, I would appreciate if you give this estimates with the disclaimer that they should be taken with a grain of salt, not like things that can be used for certain.
I don‚Äôt have anything against using stats as a little guidance, but I didn‚Äôt like the fact you tried to dismiss a very important success advice like following your own passion. Stats can be used only as a complement to that advice.

‚ÄúTechnical writing‚Äù is clearly at the bottom, but the ‚Äúgigs added‚Äù is equal to the number of sales. This category is definitely a new one and is trending, sellers are trying to check how this category will work out. And the paycheck is good. Worth testing (IMHO).
Another example. Why there are only ‚Äú+26 gigs‚Äù for the last month in the ‚ÄúTranslation‚Äù category? It is very big (when compared to others). And the price is very low. My thought (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) - the category is oversaturated and there is nothing new a person can add there. Expect a heavy competition even if you are a pro- translator.
As a writer and a translator, I totally agree with you on this one! The heavy competition on translation is real. I had months when I did big money with translations, and months that I barely did anything.
PS: I would like you to apply these numbers somehow. Seriously. Just go out there and find a way to use these numbers to your advantage. Earn some big bucks on Fiverr. And then come and tell us about your success. We will have much more to learn from it then.",,"Oct 24, 2018 2:05 am",2020-08-14 22:39:42.496288

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.

Maybe it could show the average number of sales & selling price per seller in each category.
Average number of sales, that is interesting. An abstract example:
‚ÄúOn average in this category sellers receive 10 sales per week‚Äù, is that a right example, @uk1000 ?
uk1000:
What you could do is create a gig that showed the the gigs / gig categories that were most likely to give the most profit per hour worked based on someone‚Äôs existing info (eg. the gigs they currently have and the categories & subcategories they‚Äôre in, bio, qualifications & skills listed and skill scores and category scores within skills, courses taken etc.).
That is also a very interesting thing. To give a suggestion. I already have all the keywords, skills in my database. Need to think of that.
miiila:
For me, for example, it would be interesting to know if/how much my own revenue per sold gig and monthly income differs from the monthly average and of course the minimum and maximum, while comparisons cross categories are less relevant for me.
I have a list of top sellers for each category (and sub-category). Yes, the earnings are not precise, but that could be at least something. Would that be interesting to you, @miiila ?
miiila:
What I can say though, is that I sometimes have gigs that take me several days or whole weeks, last month, for instance, I had to go OOO for 2 weeks to do just 1 gig. Obviously, I don‚Äôt work 2 weeks for $5.
I see and understand, and that makes sense. Thank you for the information!

Average number of sales, that is interesting. An abstract example:
‚ÄúOn average in this category sellers receive 10 sales per week‚Äù, is that a right example, @uk1000
Yes (or sort of) and price. Just for an average gig they (an average seller) have in that category (or subcategory) average number of sales and average selling price (estimate).
eg. if I was to create a gig in that category/subcategory, roughly how many sales per week/month and at what price (avg selling price) would I expect to receive. Obviously if someone created a gig there they may not receive the average number of sales per week/month at the specified price but it could just be a rough guide.
If you were doing it for a particular user you could compare their skills/scores/qualifications/courses taken etc. to sellers with similar skills etc. to maybe give a more accurate expected number of sales and $ amount per week/month if they created a gig in a particular category/subcategory (by taking average sales numbers and prices only for sellers in the category who had similar skills/scores etc. as the user you were creating the estimate for). You could also maybe recommend a gig selling price based on their info.",,"Oct 24, 2018 10:03 am",2020-08-14 22:39:45.288224

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.

I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.

Yes, but I don‚Äôt think it would be a good idea to post that, thanks for the offer though!
Absolutely agree with you. I will not post sellers stats here officially.
@miiila, I have a straight question. If I will create a gig offering: I will compare your seller-account within a specific category with other sellers in that category. Will you buy it?
uk1000:
If you were doing it for a particular user you could compare their skills/scores/qualifications/courses taken etc. to sellers with similar skills etc. to maybe give a more accurate expected number of sales and $ amount per week/month if they created a gig in a particular category/subcategory (by taking average sales numbers and prices only for sellers in the category who had similar skills/scores etc. as the user you were creating the estimate for). You could also maybe recommend a gig selling price based on their info.
Wow, @uk1000, that is a very cool idea with such a detailed explanation, thank you! Would you use such a tool for yourself? It sounds awesome, I‚Äôm just trying to understand if there is an interest in such info.
Guys/girls, I would like to thank you all for so much help here, really. I appreciate all the input from all of you.",,"Oct 25, 2018 6:48 am",2020-08-14 22:39:47.700849

I do buy gigs on Fiverr sometimes, but those are either of actual use to myself (the first thing I did on Fiverr was not selling but buying a gig to see how things look ‚Äúfrom the other side‚Äù, then gig videos, a drawing, a vector file) or gifts for someone.
Such a comparison as you may be able to deliver, with more or less vaguely sourced statistics, while interesting, wouldn‚Äôt help me with my business here. I have some exp and ‚Äòstats‚Äô that actually are helpful to me but it‚Äôs comparisons you couldn‚Äôt help me with, because you‚Äôre neither a buyer of my niche nor a competitor messaging me, nor can you go through my categories with my eyes and look for and find the things that are of more practical interest and helpful to me than numbers.
On the other hand, if I stumbled over such a gig and it looked interesting enough and made me curious enough to buy it, I might, though. But it‚Äôs rather improbable because I‚Äôd not search for a gig like that in the first place, so it‚Äôs not probable I‚Äôd stumble over it - unless I saw it on the forum, but as self-promo isn‚Äôt allowed apart from in My Fiverr Gigs and I‚Äôve muted that category, improbable still.
So, yeah, I‚Äôm not sure if you could really sell a gig like that, simply because (my assumption) few or no sellers would look for it or would think they‚Äôd get actual use out of it, but since you have 7 gig slots as an unleveled seller, why not try it out if you think it may be useful for sellers, you can advertise it in MFG and off-site, after all, so maybe you can get people curious enough to buy it. If it won‚Äôt sell, you can always replace it by another gig.",,"Oct 25, 2018 7:38 am",2020-08-14 22:39:48.101779

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.

I think he means pricing shown in the gig/gig packages instead of the exact price sold at here]. I totally understand that reviews are not showing all the sales, and that gig price is not showing the exact amount of the sales. But my task was to compare categories.

When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.
Before I‚Äôll wrap up, my final question to you is: what stats would you like to see next?

Also gig and package prices can give a reasonable approximation of price per order (and 20% could be taken off due to Fiverr‚Äôs share). Though it wouldn‚Äôt let you know custom offers amounts. You could also assume, for gig packages that a certain percentage would normally buy the basic and standard package rather than the premium package, based on checking a number of existing orders (the seller doing the analysis could check their own orders). The analysis could also have an option to exclude gigs which ask to contact before ordering and/or which had packages so more accurate pricing could be determined (eg. if there‚Äôs only 1 gig price and they don‚Äôt ask to contact first, many people might order with that gig price - though gig extras might also need to be taken into account or if there were extras you could assume the estimate was a minimum and that it could be higher due to gig extras/tips).",,"Apr 5, 2019 2:35 pm",2020-08-14 22:39:53.650478

It is not a guarantee that your profile will pick up quickly, but with time (and while offering excellent, or unique, services) your profile will gain some traction. Just be sure to reply to messages quickly, but thoroughly! Be professional, respectful, and generous!
Like any sole proprietorship/freelance-related work, it‚Äôs best (for most people) to start as a hobby or income-generating activity, then let it build up appropriately. Once you have gained enough of a workload, slowly transition into it more full-time‚Ä¶ or keep pushing if you already are!
Especially with coders/programmers‚Ä¶ it will take time! Be patient and persistent, and hopefully you will achieve the success you are looking for!
Yes- Gig videos, great samples, and high volume keywords will also help! Just do the best you can to market yourself, and keep at it!

Tips for Sellers",60,3.5k,147,"Oct 19, 2018 6:37 am","Oct 19, 2018 7:27 am","Nov 1, 2019 1:41 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/fiverr-categories-stats/284692,,the_cable_guy,44.0,"Hello everyone.
When I first found out about the Fiverr, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time reading posts, articles, tips and etc to understand what is its specificity. Still, I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm a learning seller and I have nothing to brag about in terms of earnings.
I‚Äôve started with studying my knowledge and strengths to find out what exactly I can do here. And I, as a full-stack developer, have a pretty long list of what I can do. For me it was the question of what will be most profitable to sell on Fiverr. It turns out that it‚Äôs a stupid thing to try to sell my Selenium skills here to the clients (no one knows what a heck is that). Fiverr is a very specific platform. In order to succeed here you must clearly see that or all your attempts will hit a wall.
Getting to the point. After studying the theory (and getting tired of all the posts like ‚Äúbe consistent‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your strengths‚Äù, ‚Äúdo the quality work‚Äù, ‚Äúadd a video‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt add a video‚Äù) I switched my attention to the power of numbers and statistics. I wanted to know which categories are doing better on Fiverr.
And I have something to share.

These are the stats for all top categories on Fiverr.
The numbers are for the last two months and are approximate. The list is sorted by overall sales amount in descending order.
Memo:
Gray - Quantity of sales in a category.
Green - Average price per sale.
Blue - Overall sales amount.
Orange - Gigs added over the last month.
Red - The number of sellers in the category.
This overall stat was not that eye-opening. I knew that the Design category is the leading one, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be soooo huge.
Next step. As I‚Äôm interested in the technical category, I looked at the numbers for ‚ÄúProgramming & Tech‚Äù sub-categories:

‚Ä¶ and I was thinking of selling chat-bots, good thing I didn‚Äôt spend much time on that :).
It‚Äôs more than a year Chat bots category was introduced (July 13, 2017 is specified in the article ‚ÄúIntroducing Our Newest Category: Chatbots!‚Äù on Fiverr blog). Enough time for evaluation.
Let me be sincere, I hate WordPress ('cause of its greed for resources and a mess created by plugins). I will skip to sub-category ‚ÄúMobile Apps & Web‚Äù. And here is what I see:
Do you see anything interesting? I do. The statistics show me: not all categories are equal, there are old categories that are still not getting any traction (and wouldn‚Äôt at least there will be a change in technology), there are categories that are trending, some categories are very low-priced, like ‚ÄúUser Testing‚Äù with $15 on average per sale.
Why I‚Äôm I writing all this to you?
First, because I‚Äôm tired of all those posts covering the same ‚Äúfind your strength‚Äù message over and over and over again without providing any new value to the community.
Secondly, I‚Äôm a strong believer in ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù. I will learn more when I will hear comments, messages, or even accusations from you
And lastly, I hopefully expect that overall level of sellers will improve with such sharing of knowledge. And when all are improving, I‚Äôm improving as well. 'cause I‚Äôm so excited about what Fiverr and it‚Äôs doers-company does! It‚Äôs our freedom. It‚Äôs our future.

If you do not have a smart phone or you do not want to install any more apps in your smartphone, there is another option for you. This will not keep you connected to your profile 24/7 but will notify you about any activity or order instantly via sms. This way you will at least be able to respond quickly to your orders and maintain a shorter response time.
To do that we will use an awesome free service called IFTTT (If This Than That). Go to www.Ifttt.com 76 and register your account. Then follow these simple steps:
Step 1: From the top menu bar click on your user name and then click on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù from the drop down.
Step 2: Click on the big blue under lined ‚Äúthis‚Äù text and then write ‚ÄúFiverr‚Äù in the text box that says ‚Äúchoose trigger channel‚Äù.
Step 3: As you are writing ‚ÄúFiverr‚Äù in the text box, black fiverr logo will appear, click on it. You might be asked to sign in to your fiverr account to connect it to IFTTT.
Step 4: A screen similar to the one below will appear. Click on the first option that says ‚ÄúNew Gig Ordered‚Äù and after that click on the blue button that says ‚ÄúCreate Trigger‚Äù.
Step 5: Click on the big blue under lined text that says ‚Äúthat‚Äù. Simple, isn‚Äôt it, as I said earlier.
Step 6: In the choose channel text box write SMS and click on the last result.
Step 7: Enter your number in the pop up and wait for the pin to arrive in your sms. Type in the pin you receive and click on ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. Wait a while and you will be taken to next step.
Step 8: From the ‚ÄúChoose an action‚Äù step choose the only available option that is ‚Äúsend me an SMS‚Äù.
Step 9: In next step click on ‚ÄúCreate action‚Äù
Step 10: And in next step click on ‚ÄúCreate Recipe‚Äù

Regular",1.0,"I don‚Äôt actually think so. Response rate is fairly new, while response time has been around for ages. My response rate bounces all over the place depending on inbox spam and nonsense messages from confused sellers. Mine goes anywhere from 65-95% while my response time has stayed between 1-3 hours steadily for pretty much the whole time I‚Äôve been on Fiverr.
I answer relevant messages mostly within 2 hours so that average seems about right. I‚Äôm not a sound sleeper so it isn‚Äôt unusual for me to check messages in the middle of the night. On the other hand, I flat out don‚Äôt answer spam and some silly inbox messages which tanks my response rate but seems to affect my response time very little.
As far as why Fiverr implemented response rate and whether it has a useful point, that‚Äôs a question only they can answer. They try some things out or implement some things just for seller‚Äôs to look at with no particular affect on sales. The world domination map is sort of fun, but definitely doesn‚Äôt affect my search placement or anything, for example. Fiverr is a young company that toys with some features just to see what might be of use down the road.
It‚Äôs kind of a moot point overall anyway, but I don‚Äôt think new sellers should assume that they have a big problem if their ‚Äúresponse rate‚Äù is low. That hasn‚Äôt proven to be the case yet. I doubt I‚Äôll bother continuing to bat this across the net any further but that‚Äôs where I stand.",,"Jan 14, 2016 1:26 pm",2020-08-14 22:40:12.796649

If you do not have a smart phone or you do not want to install any more apps in your smartphone, there is another option for you. This will not keep you connected to your profile 24/7 but will notify you about any activity or order instantly via sms. This way you will at least be able to respond quickly to your orders and maintain a shorter response time.
To do that we will use an awesome free service called IFTTT (If This Than That). Go to www.Ifttt.com 76 and register your account. Then follow these simple steps:
Step 1: From the top menu bar click on your user name and then click on ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù from the drop down.
Step 2: Click on the big blue under lined ‚Äúthis‚Äù text and then write ‚ÄúFiverr‚Äù in the text box that says ‚Äúchoose trigger channel‚Äù.
Step 3: As you are writing ‚ÄúFiverr‚Äù in the text box, black fiverr logo will appear, click on it. You might be asked to sign in to your fiverr account to connect it to IFTTT.
Step 4: A screen similar to the one below will appear. Click on the first option that says ‚ÄúNew Gig Ordered‚Äù and after that click on the blue button that says ‚ÄúCreate Trigger‚Äù.
Step 5: Click on the big blue under lined text that says ‚Äúthat‚Äù. Simple, isn‚Äôt it, as I said earlier.
Step 6: In the choose channel text box write SMS and click on the last result.
Step 7: Enter your number in the pop up and wait for the pin to arrive in your sms. Type in the pin you receive and click on ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. Wait a while and you will be taken to next step.
Step 8: From the ‚ÄúChoose an action‚Äù step choose the only available option that is ‚Äúsend me an SMS‚Äù.
Step 9: In next step click on ‚ÄúCreate action‚Äù
Step 10: And in next step click on ‚ÄúCreate Recipe‚Äù
Here is what we have done, we have made a recipe in IFTTT that will do what the above image shows. Decoding the image is simple. ‚ÄúIf my gig is ordered in fiverr then send me a text message on my number‚Äù

I don‚Äôt believe there is any single path to success. Everyone needs to find what works best for them.
I will never even attempt to stay connected 24 hours a day. It doesn‚Äôt work for me. But, I still have managed to be fairly successful on Fiverr and in my life outside of the platform.
In general, I try and respond to every message, even spam, because I don‚Äôt want to take risks with my level. I use a quick response for spam and then block (or re-block) the sender. Messages that want work I don‚Äôt offer or just aren‚Äôt a good fit also get a quick response. I only care about response rate as it relates to my level.
Messages from potential clients get personalized responses, even if they are asking information in my gig description. I clearly communicate my price and turnaround times. This chases away buyers who can‚Äôt afford me. My goal with my responses is to convert as many of these potential buyers that are a good fit for me into actual buyers.
I think response time may matter more to some buyers than others. My response time is usually 3-5 hours. I never interrupt my work to deal with messages. When I am very busy, I only check messages twice a day. Once in the morning and once I‚Äôm done with billable work.
Early in May my orders dried up. During that time I was doing marketing, retoooing gigs, adding gigs, etc. I did respond immediately during that time to messages and was able to quickly convert some prospects before they moved on. As a consequence, my response time dropped to 1 hour, the lowest it has ever been. But, now I get more messages than ever, most of them from buyers I will never work with. I am now busy again and back to my old twice a day routine for checking messages. I expect my response time to drop.
For me, quality of the communication with prospects matters much more than speed. Your mileage may vary.",,"Jun 2, 2018 4:27 pm",2020-08-14 22:40:14.751518

Every week I get a few messages from buyers asking if I could show them a rough sketch as it would help them purchase my services and the answer is always No!
It is important not to work for free, ever! What they are asking is just like going into a restaurant and asking for a small piece of steak saying that if you like it then you would order. That is just stupid.
Trust me, nothing good can come from you working for free. It just sends the message that the buyer can take advantage of you.
Here is a list of reasons why you should decline such a buyer:
They come from an unhealthy work ethic.
If you make the sketch super quick then probabilly it wouldn‚Äôt look really good and they would reject it.
If you spend a lot of time working for a ‚ÄúPossible Order‚Äù then that is simply not efficient.
If they like the sketch and think your price is too high they might go to another cheaper priced designer and have them recreate it.
If they like the sketch and your price is too low, that is underselling your work.
A buyer who asks for free work in 99% of cases will bargen with you on prices.
Copyright Issues, you have no idea where that sketch, concept, idea came from.
Take care!

Tip to keeping a buyer responding to your questions as regards to any order,"Fiverr Tips

     I recently found out that as soon as I get an order, most of the time, a good number of buyers respond very late each time I ask any question. For this reason, I decided to remind my client of the importance of always keeping in touch. I would always put up a write-up like this ""Please friend, endeavor to always check your mobile or PC in case I have any question as regards to your order. With this, I would be able to serve you better, thanks."" That's it! Since then all my clients have always been very responsive, and in most cases, they would be the ones first to ask if I have any question. I believe this would also work for other sellers. 
Thanks, Stacy.",,,,,,,,,2020-08-14 22:40:29.795629
