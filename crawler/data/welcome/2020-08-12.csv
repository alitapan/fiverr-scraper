None of this suggests credibility or ethics or that the person would be decent to work with.

There is no need to give out your number in order to download an Android app. The buyer is most likely a scammer or ignorant as @humanissocial also said.
Of course, it is allowed to do the work required in the Android app, but there is no reason to give out his personal contact details, nor is there any reason to communicate outside of Fiverr.

Fiverr Staff",47,"Hi Everyone,
In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.
You will receive a notification on the Fiverr website and an email message asking you to check your status within 30 days, in a form of a short questionnaire.
If in fact you are classified as a US Person*, you will undergo a short process in which you will fill in Form W-9 that contains standard business information to include your contact information, full address and tax forms.
Fiverr will not use the information submitted as part of filling the Form W-9 for any purpose, apart from sending a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities and update your billing address on Fiverr.
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
Please read this article 31 carefully for all the information.
FAQ -
Why are you doing this?

Please read this article 31 carefully for all the information.
FAQ -
Why are you doing this?
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.
Is “tip” considered a transaction?
Any transaction, including tips is counted toward the 200 transactions. An order and a tip are each seperate transatctions.
Is this for money earned or money withdrawn?
Money earned.
Will Fiverr will start to display our legal names anywhere, or is this all internal only?
In certain circumstances, we may disclose the data in your W-9 form, with applicable US tax authorities, or as otherwise required by applicable law. None of this information will be displayed publicly on Fiverr.

I completed the basic English test … No doubt that I am fluent in English and ready for any task that will be allotted to me in the not too distant future. Is there any other Fiverr users who achieved an average of 9 to 10 for the basic English test?
Your comments would be highly appreciated …
Regards from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.

No, you can get banned for review exchange, not favorite exchange.
Favorite exchange does nothing, so it’s not strictly forbidden, it’s just useless.
As for the clicks and views you’d get (probably just from those who favorite your gigs), if they don’t result in sales (and they won’t, because those people don’t want to buy from you), your conversion rate will drop, and then your gig ranking might drop, too.

Thoughts???",N/A,N/A,N/A,celticmoon,0,"Some sellers are asked to sign nondisclosures because in order to perform their gig they have to view material which is sensitive, involves legal or medical matters, has to do with unresolved criminal matters or not-yet-published materials. I’m sure there are lots of other reasons, too. The jobs could be editing, creating PDF’s, transcription, things like that. Not signing the non-disclosure I’m sure will result in not getting the job. By signing it, you agree to keep the information it contains private, not discuss it with or allow it to be viewed by others, or do anything to benefit yourself with the information it contains. All pretty straightforward.



I recall someone here on Fiverr posting that she signed a non-disclosure before doing something - I think it was edit - a police document.



You will have to put personal information on the form, to what extent I don’t know, but some exchange of this type of info is allowed by Fiverr, for example mailing addresses for items that must be shipped, and I don’t think filling out a non-disclosure is against the TOS because of what it’s for, but to assure yourself completely, in case things have changed or the person whose post I read was incorrect and therefore I’m giving you the wrong information, you should contact CS.",N/A,"May 19, 2014 4:36 pm",2020-08-12 18:36:54.920308

When issues like this happen, you don’t have to cancel orders, as that would affect your completion rate. All you have to do is to go to the resolution center and extend the date. It is as easy as that.
Secondly, you do not need to go to the Customer Support for rectification. The process is an automated one and can’t be controlled manually by an individual.

I’m currently in a situation where I got an order which I’m to delivered it within 24 hours and I completed the project and delivered it within 6 hours.
And later the buyer asked for a revision which I also delivered it in no time. But the buyer has accepted the order and hasn’t said anything about the order although they kept coming online.
What I’m afraid of is that will it affect my on-time-delivery percentage if the buyer later asked for another revision?
Because currently this is my 7th order and I have.
100% on-time-delivery
100% order completion
100% respond time

I was doing freelancing on my own, in my hometown (THE hometown of POUTINE! Yeah, I know, so cool hein?), but now I am moving to the next level by offering my services on the web. I am totally new on Fiverr and would be happy to hear about freelancers experiences here.
Bien le bonjour à tous et à toutes!

Avant d’arriver sur Fiverr, je travaillais déjà à mon compte comme rédactrice freelance. Maintenant que j’ai établi ma clientèle autour de moi, je me lance dans l’aventure du freelancing sur le web!

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 1:44 pm",2020-08-12 18:41:25.226171

Hope you all are doing good.
Well, as being a member of fiverr from last more than 2 years, I faced alot of things and got alot of experience and being a member of this platform fiverr forum I see many open topics specially from newbies asking only thing How to get order?
As being a responsible member or to maintain my trust on others on this forum I replied on many topics, help others in many ways which are possible from my side. But reading alot of questions on same topic, I conclude that there are few tips that I have to share separately instead of giving reply on all the post or the things that you should follow before posting a topic related to how to get order as I see in almost all the topics, people are asking how to get but haven’t implement any of the thing from the following which are so important specially for newbie and much common for the one who is aware with all that.
Please go through the following tips as these are the most important for those who are asking how to get first order or since (this month) haven’t receive any order etc etc.
1- First, and the most childish act which many of you are doing and asking for reviewing your profile,
Description on your profile means, a brief description of what you are and why you are here and what you will do or give to your client.
It doesn’t mean you start writing I am new here and want some work and I will do in free of cost etc etc as I see many newbies are doing this childish acts which is totally wrong and give a bad impact on buyers. So, use this description option to show yourself, not for begging purpose.
2- At No Level fiverr allow to make 5 gigs, so create all 5 gigs even if you have same category.
3- Place a cover photo “eye catching” which can grab the people’s attention easily. Gig covers are the best thing to grab some one’s attention so never try to copy covers from others, always try to come up with something unique.
4- Don’t copy the material from other gigs (specially pictures in graphics designing gigs).
May be this is common for you but buyers notice this alot if you are copying data while creating a gig then how less percent chances there will be that you will deliver something unique.So, try to come up with unique ideas .
5- Just mention the things in your gigs which you can do easily (be HONEST, don’t mention more than your expertise).
6- Use common search tags while creating a gigs. Don’t use unique keywords, because search tags are the most important thing as buyers use the search tags while searching for gigs.
7- As a beginner, start your gig packages with a less amount as this time you have to gain the buyer’s trust. So try to provide your service in a discounted price.
Less amount never means you start offering all the services in 5$, you have to check the market value by visiting multiple gigs, just try to offer little less amount than others.
8- Refresh your gigs on daily basis.
9- Check Buyers Requests frequently.
10- Also, you can share your gig link on social sites like linkedin, facebook pages etc. It can also help you.
All the above points are the most common and important that you should follow before asking for how to get order. These are things I noticed, from the very start nothing is implemented in the profile and in gigs but sellers are pretending like they did alot of efforts but not receiving any order.
After all of this, one thing which is the most important and that is Time. Keep this thing in your mind freelancing is not that easy as you think. You have to give alot of time, you have to gain alot of trust and also you have to wait alot too.
In no any business, no one start getting profit after a month or two. Struggle is the most important thing, indeed. And it is your business, so you have to be motivated, always!
I’m sure, after following all the above points you will receive your order soon. And, after receiving your order, try to give your best to your client, try to do some chit chat with your client to gain his trust, ask everything in detail and deliver your best as much as possible. Because, first review on your profile will be the first impression of your profile.
In the end, I wish you all a very best of luck and yes, Thanks alot for reading this post.
Always be motivated, Never lose Hopes!

On a personal note, I’m recently on Maternity Leave from my full-time (and then some!) job as a Project Manager for a trucking company.

I’m strongly considering not returning to my corporate 9-5 and going back to freelancing, which I did full-time a number of years ago.
Professionally, my skills are quite versatile, and I’ve yet to decide which of them I’ll focus on offering to start with.

As the post title suggests, I’m new around here and I’m interested and open to any constructive criticism from more experienced users.
On a personal note, I’m recently on Maternity Leave from my full-time (and then some!) job as a Project Manager for a trucking company. This will be baby number 3 for me, and I also have 2 step-children. In case math isn’t your strong point, that’s 5 children all under the age of 12! I also have 4 cats, a couple of birds and a husband… I’m not sure which category he fits into… (haha!) I’m strongly considering not returning to my corporate 9-5 and going back to freelancing, which I did full-time a number of years ago.
Professionally, my skills are quite versatile, and I’ve yet to decide which of them I’ll focus on offering to start with.
I look forward to getting to know some of you through this forum, and any feedback concerning what I’ve put together so far in terms of gigs or my profile is welcome and appreciated.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:11 pm",2020-08-12 18:45:36.007476

This is the Fiverr trap. You can complain all you want but Foverr pretty much has no care or concern about rip off gigs. Your money will stay there and if you push hard enough, they will move the money to look like it was EARNED by you which means you pay a commission to Fiverr on withdrawing it.

It doesn’t work like that. The CRM (customer relationship management) system knows whats going on because the buyer and seller are logged in.
All you have to do is define the policies/rules. If you go to open a new dispute it will tell you that one is in progress so you cannot open another and the button is gone. It is a similar principle for other rules.
Its very easy really as long as your software supports you.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 8:09 am",2020-08-12 18:47:18.262182

It’s like why would someone do a book promotion if they needed many reviews of the book already? They do book promotion to start the sales off and get the reviews really. So Fiverr requiring a minimum of 30 reviews for a gig to be promoted doesn’t seem the best thing to do really.

donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-08-12 18:47:54.093123

Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom. And I qualify for the program. Not saying it’s intentional or anything, but it’s certain some popular gigs are at the bottom and they are obviously encouraged to pay for exposure since they are not getting new messages or customers.
My most popular gig is currently not on the first page of search results, but it does not qualify for this program, since it isn’t within a category currently open to ads. I do have a logo design gig that qualifies, but I do not yet have access to the ads platform. Where a seller’s gigs are, right now, clearly does not relate to the potential for a seller within the ads program. As you know, gigs rotate around regularly. I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-08-12 18:48:09.405838

in the past two weeks the inquiries dropped, with me, with you and with others people. I’m almost sure that the reason is because the new Promote Gig feature.
Please don’t make assumptions. The new ad promotion feature was officially released YESTERDAY. It doesn’t have anything to with your loss of sales over the PAST TWO WEEKS. It is unwise to cast blame on other things, when, in reality, the only person who can make you successful and earn you orders is YOU. If your sales are low, no one else is to blame. Do some marketing research, and figure out how to better connect to your target customers. That’s how you earn orders.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:04 pm",2020-08-12 18:48:09.795657

It is super unfair that there are some newly joined sellers that have waay more experience in a certain area than say one “top rated seller”.
Claimed experience in the past, has very little to do with what buyers see in the present. When buyers look at the services of a TRS, they see a hard-built reputation on this site, with reviews, testimonials, buyer samples, etc. When buyers look at a new seller, they see an unproven risk, and a seller with no social proof of his/her claimed skills. More often than not, a buyer is going to hire the proven professional with reviews, samples, and social proof. That’s usually how business works no matter where you go. It is, therefore, unrealistic to claim this to be unfair. We all start at the bottom and work our way up. New sellers need to work hard to prove themselves… TRS sellers have already done this. That’s just how business works.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-08-12 18:48:10.207509

I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.
Maybe not. However, since the day the program was released I didn’t receive any message from any new customer. Usually I get at least 2-3 per day. So… that’s strange since this is the third day.

eg. in the “Video & Animation” category they only allow promoted gigs for the “Whiteboard & Animated Explainers” subcategory, not the “Character Animation” subcategory currently.
Also if your gigs are okay re: the requirements, another reason you might not be able to see it is because sellers are manually picked for it currently according to the help page (it says “only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics…”).",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:14 am",2020-08-12 18:48:14.922047

I really don’t work on other platforms because Fiverr is superior in every way. So to have a scare like this is unfortunate. Literally the entire world has so much to worry about, this was one place I felt a little bit secure.
Hopefully, time will work out the kinks.
I have put so much effort into my gigs and portfolio and it would be a shame for new buyers to not have many choices on the first pages. As of now the same people are showing up day after day in the front pages. Great for them! Not so great for the rest. I just wonder how much more the revenue is from ads rather than TRS bringing in their normal revenue.
Well let’s try to stay positive. This too shall pass.
I have been on Fiverr long enough to realize there are ups and downs. When I have a down turn it gives me a much needed chance to catch my breath and relax.

Competitors can easily click on your gig and make you pay for basically nothing.
That happens on Google sometimes. Some competitors want to exhaust your advertising budget so they click on your ads. Don’t know if that will happen on Fiverr. Sometimes when I search using filters, I can find my gig on the first three rows.
creativezoone:
If my gig has been deleted - How could be show in promoted gig? - even i’m not able to view that gig.
Can your deleted gig be rescued? Or was it deleted forever? Maybe they want you to activate it again, perhaps with higher prices (I’m assuming you were charging $5 or $10 before, I could be wrong)
donnovan86:
Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom.
If you ever gotten an order from a stranger, chances are your gig was on page 1, at least for a while. I think that’s what happen to me with my other gigs, the ones that don’t get enough impressions. Today I got an order for Google ads, I haven’t gotten an order from that gig in three months, maybe longer.

My average sale price is $94. All I can say is I hope it’s financially worth it for Fiverr to loose out on our incoming revenue.
Fiverr isn’t like a traditional company where profitable employees are protected. Fiverr has inflexible standards, you could be a TRS, you could be making $10,000 a month, but if your Order Completion Rate falls to 89%, you’ll be demoted to level 2.
It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.

It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
You said it perfectly! My order requirements are a bit more strong because it forces buyers to think about what they are giving me. It’s a total team effort and buyers have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the project too. I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue. The quality of your work and your buyers who love your work, will in time, be a repeat-business machine! That is what all business owners want… 80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Ads will only get you poised in the right spot but you better be ready to serve as a professional.
I have changed my mind on the ads. At first it seemed like things were changing on the first two pages. But like always, I was just patient and used my down time to improve my portfolio, gigs and demo. I am actually grateful for those few weeks. I see an increase in new and great buyers. So somehow they are still finding me.
I already know sellers who are opting out of the Ad program after paying for ads because the results are not as organic. I am sure it’s paying off for others. I am just going to stay positive and hope the ads are successful.
My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night. You build it and they will find you.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 2:03 pm",2020-08-12 18:48:41.999558

I used to have 5 to 15 in my queue and always rushing since I had to deliver in 3 days or less. Then 4 or 5 days later, I would get revision requests.

So to get results with the ADS you need follow your statics, the ADS don’t will help you if you don’t see this statics to keep improving it. I geted a good order with the Ads and spended just $3.39 of the $10 gift from Fiverr.

I don’t have the option, so such experience posts are really interesting. Did you or do you think you got orders out of it?
What I’m wondering is, if, as I’ve read, you can only use ads with already popular gigs, wouldn’t actually interested buyers keep clicking your gig anyway, promoted or not, and would you perhaps rather pay for curious or malicious sellers clicking them?
If someone could clearly say they got orders from advertising, that would be good to know.
I’m assuming you might be able to see it, like you can also see when you got an order from a gig while it was ‘Fiverr’s Choice’.
And do you get a bill from Fiverr for the ads, so that you would be able to file the cost as expenses for income tax?",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-12 18:48:46.197825

Yes i received one order, you can track the order that came from ads. The Promotion Ads still in beta, so certainly they will fix eventualy problems… i’m using the Gift from Fiverr to test Ads. I recommend read all this topic: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/promoted-gigs 5
I don’t know how will work for “Fiverr’s Choice”, but i think that the better way is be able to track where the order came from… like the ads you can see what order came from ads.
Everything is about test, i think that ADS is more one option to get orders, i believe too that how much early you start to use it better will be for you or maybe this feature can become more difficulty to use in future because the number of the users that will be using it (i don’t know)… but i hope be able to promote my others GIG too, i don’t wanna promote my best seller gig.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:05 am",2020-08-12 18:48:46.612267

that will suppress the exposure to new sellers
New sellers need to learn how to build their own exposure, instead of expecting Fiverr to do it for them. If new sellers were allowed to participate in the ads program, they would quickly swamp the system, and make it useless for it’s intended purpose. Fiverr clearly wants successful, experienced sellers to be the only sellers who are allowed to purchase promotion within their categories.
It’s also worth noting that new sellers don’t have the funds in their Fiverr accounts to purchase promotion. Level 2 and TRS sellers already have earned funds within their accounts to purchase the optional promoted visibility.
bumblepixco:
Already we r not getting enough.
New sellers already have a short-term bump in the search algorithm. It is their responsibility to build upon that, and keep the momentum going. There is no such thing as new sellers, “not getting enough”. New sellers do not deserve everything that they want, just because they want it. New sellers need to earn their success, just like the veteran sellers have done.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:59 am",2020-08-12 18:48:49.357768

I wrote to fiverr support and they never got back to me about this, and as far as I can see nobody has a clear correct answer about this.
I did a video for my gig description and when I watch it on my PC it’s top quality, uploaded to fiverr as a gig description video, and the video has lost a lot of quality and looks very blurred. Pointless to have it there at that quality.
does anyone know a clear answer to this?
Thank you

You cannot see what review your buyer gave you before you leave them a review, so I don’t get why you thought they left you a 1-star review.
I suggest you take some time to figure out how Fiverr works. In fact, you should have done so before you started selling. Start here: sellers.fiverr.com/en/ 1
You should also read the Terms of Service. You agreed to them when signing up: https://www.fiverr.com/terms_of_service",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 11:36 am",2020-08-12 18:49:41.166444

You are not permitted to discuss with buyer about review
I had a buyer who gave me a 3.7 even after we had a great outcome. She said she would have like more attention. ??? The only review ever below 4.7! I was completely shocked when she showed up again in my custom request! I explained that I was confused about her rating and would she be so kind to explain so I could learn from her experience. She really didn’t offer any advice or feedback. I explained based on her review I was probably not the voice she was looking for. I did what I fondly call, “the take away”
She was also confused and said she is new to Fiverr and wasn’t aware of the importance of the star system. I further explained that based on her first impression I was not willing to move forward. She was totally shocked and apologized for her lack of awareness.
I explained that I understand and that all
of us on Fiverr were new at one point and we have learned a few things along the way.
She was so real with her explanation that I gave her another try. I said NOTHING about giving me a better review. Our discussion allowed her to think through her feedback to sellers. I was so nervous the entire time but did my best.
She left me a 5 star review and we both left with a few learned lessons.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:05 am",2020-08-12 18:49:47.529870

The best place to lower the file size of the video file is when you encode your video in the video encoding software (such as Adobe media encoder). Choose a lower bitrate there if you want it a lower file size, but don’t lower it so much that the picture quality looks too bad and starts showing artefacts. Also use variable bitrate if you weren’t (eg. 2 pass encoding - though it will take longer to render. You could also do 1 pass variable bitrate for speed).
edit: Technically maybe there could be a way to do it that takes advantage of the fact that it’s video of stuff repeating over and over again. But unless there’s some way for you to alter the files uploaded to to dropbox (run some operation on them), maybe you’d need to get the buyer’s permission to do whatever needs doing and that might mean concatenating files somehow. eg. if there’s a video header and then sections of video that repeat (I don’t know if there’s also a footer in the file) maybe the repeated section could be sent once (if the bytes are identical) and then concatenated by the buyer if that worked (eg. using windows copy command with the “/b” for binary?). eg. so the buyer adds (or runs a script/batch file that adds) the header file+the repeated section x number of times+any footer. Or maybe that would be too risky/difficult for the buyer to do. But in theory it might work.
Also I agree that you should ask for a delivery extension to give you more time if you need it.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 11:37 am",2020-08-12 18:52:26.663817

It’s a 3 hour video which has a stock footage repeating again and again for relaxing
Since it is a repeating video, you can do one more thing. (but fist Ask your client for it).
Ask your client which editing software he/she uses (Mac have free BTW). Now use that software yourself and repeat the video in it. (as long as you want). Now send the project file to the client. and guide him or her to render it himself/herself.
You will be just uploading the basic vid file (around 100 MB I guess) and the project file (Not more than 1 Mb).
Though it is a complex process, Confirm from your client if it’s ok with him/her.

Welcome to Fiverr! I would love to help you grow on the platform. It has everything to do with SEO-optimization of your GIG’s description, title, and your whole profile. Fiverr’s algorithm gives your gigs a score depending on several factors. Here a few quick tips:
Use 2-3 keywords that are related to your service and include them in the title as well.
Check out the tags your biggest competitors use and test them with your gig.
Don’t say: “send me a message before ordering.” This will let people bounce.
Offer the exact right price, not too low ($5) and not too high.
Treat people like your friends rather than your pay check.
Design a cover photo that draws eyes so people click on it.
My name is Oliver and I am the CEO of Dadema Internet Agency. I’ve lived in Miami and I’m now located in Amsterdam. I help new businesses grow online, by effective social media marketing. If you want me to help you, I would love to assist! Send me a pm or take a look at the gig I’m selling.

For sellers with no level, the BRs that appear for them get automatically removed by Fiverr once that particular BR receives a certain number of offers from other new sellers/sellers with no level (I think it is 10? Not entirely sure about the number though). More often than not, it is not the buyer who is removing the request.
So, once you see a couple of BRs, DO NOT refresh the page until you are done sending the offers to all the BRs you wanna respond to. Because if a BR reaches that limit of 10* applications received from sellers with no level, it WILL get removed automatically.

Is fiverr income taxable?
Yes, everywhere in the world. Only the amount for which you should register/be taxed differs from country to country.
In some places like the UK you need a VAT for nearly every digital service so that you can report every income source, while here in Italy for example if you make less than 8.145,32€ yearly on occasional work you’re in the No Tax bracket, meaning you don’t have to report any income to the State or to register yourself as a single worker.
zombiesmasher:
As in my country, when a person passes a certain threshold, the taxed imposed on them increases. I want to withdraw using Paypal and if Fiverr payment is added to my net income then the tax imposed on me will be increased.
Yeah, it’s called a bracket system. See if you can circumvent it legally or if there are any deductions, or ask how other sellers from your country behave in this situation. Maybe you don’t have to lump all your income in the same report form as your day job’s.
Also please note that on paper, you’re not a freelancer for Fiverr, you’re a Fiverr subcontractor, so you’re technically “employed” twice. You need to see for yourself how your government handles this.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 2:12 pm",2020-08-12 18:53:32.265838

Whether you treat Fiverr as a part time business (like I do), or a full time concern - you should be declaring your earnings for tax purposes.
This is another reason I have an issue with $5 gigs. I can’t imagine that most $5 sellers genuinely declare their earnings. If they did, then after commission and tax it would hardly be worth the effort - particularly in non-US countries that also have to allow for exchange rate and transfer fees.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:30 pm",2020-08-12 18:53:33.282756

I’m an ex CEO of a venture capital company, commodities trader and investment banker, and all round entrepreneur with several companies under my belt. Nowadays I prefer to live a more simple off-grid life with my uber permaculture, biodynamic, organic partner. Together with chainsawing down trees and tending our goats and pigs, she keeps me sane and healthy, with time to write and assist others on their journeys.
Out of interest, a rough ashlar is a masonic symbol meaning a rough hewn stone, that needs to be dressed by the stonemason to become a perfect ashlar. It is symbolic of our journey through life as we continually improve ourselves. I’m also a 30th degree freemason and that path has been philosophically useful and fun. However, I am more interested in the new world order that society is busy creating, one where we drop the ego and work with Nature, instead of against her for our own selfish gain.
All the best to you and your families in these difficult times.

You get and order from a client who does not know exactly what he wants. He did not read the gig description carefuly. He did not provide you with gig requirements as he should.
So you as a seller get an order that you can not complete and its not your fault. You can not do nothing else and cancel the order. When you do that you get deranked at order completition and its not your fault… now you tell me how is that NOT stupid?
I mean you cancel order in resoltion center. If you have an option, that buyer did not provide you with right info or did not buy the right gig, and buyer accepts this in resolution center. Why is then the seller penalised with percent drop in order completion and can get deranked from for ex. level 2 seller to lvl 1?
I am just saying if buyer agrees he maid a mistake or he said I am not ready for this I will buy in 1 month, than you should not get percentage drop. If you can not deliver your order or something simmilar thats another case.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:48 am",2020-08-12 18:54:49.439515

In resoltion center there is an option to pick CANCLE ORDER --> BUYER WILL BUY AGAIN
And when you pick this option, buyer can ACCEPT it or DENIE it. Even though the buyer does not buy again all I am saying, when picking this option, your percentage should not be droped because its clearly shown that something “unpredictable” went wrong.
In my case buyer bought something and did not fulfill the requirements and gave faulty ones. So he agreed he will come back to me when he has everything he needs, so we picked this option…

Buyer will order again simply means he or she May order but still not guaranteed, so if he orders later when you reach back to your 100% order completion rate it wouldn’t make any sense !

Sir or madam is only appropriate in the context of servitude, even in India and you should know that a freelancer isn’t a servant to their client.
And regardless, your clients aren’t India necessarily and neither are the people you are speaking to here. It is quite silly to think everyone should find you professional for calling them things they don’t like.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 7:06 am",2020-08-12 18:54:53.695081

I could not start with order, because he did not provide me with all information needed

I said yes, but order is due in 3 days so we need to cancle the order
I went to resolution center. Picked option CANCLE ORDER, picked option BUYER AND SELLER AGREED, picked option BUYER WILL BUY AGAIN (this is all Fiver predefined options)
Buyer got the resolution center “offer” and he accepted it. The order was canceled.
I got order completition percentage droped
All I am saying is, that in some cases, few predefined resolution center options, should not do the percentage drop.

If fiverr adds some option where Order completion rate wont drop, everyone would start picking that option even if real reason behind cancellation is different, and start taking advantage of this and this would be abuse of system !

Blame it on Covid, a lot more people came to the platform to create gigs, and Fiverr’s algorithm has to cover everyone.

Neither. You are not allowed to ask for reviews, or for reviews to be changed, or to refund the buyer in exchange for having the review removed which wouldn’t work anyways, the review stays even if the buyer cancels the order through CS after completion.
The buyer - according to the TOS- has the right to review the seller according to the experience they’ve made. I think in some cases if the buyer is actually lying in the review, you can ask CS to have the review removed but this is always a bit of a tricky subject, they will probably also quote the TOS on it.
I would leave it at that and move on, though you can respond to any review you receive which will be shown on your profile but the buyer doesn’t actually see it unless they go to your profile. You could respond mentioning that the client was difficult to deal with or something along the lines.
A 1 star review would always affect your ratings, may or may not lead to your ranking dropping and possibly can also decrease the number of requests / orders you receive temporarily. If you have still have the choice to do something about it, I’m not saying I would recommend it necessarily, but you could cancel the order before delivering so the buyer gets a refund and can’t write a negative review to begin with. But then you also don’t get paid and your order completion rate drops a bit.",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 7:40 pm",2020-08-12 18:56:05.301253

Take time to carefully review the buyer’s request. Buyers will often spend time describing the service they need in detail, and some may even attach a file for reference.
Personalize your offer and include a detailed description. This is a good place to let them know who you are and how you can do the job.
When describing your offer, address all relevant information the buyer included in their initial request.
Include only Gig Extras that actually answer the buyer’s needs.
Set a reasonable price and delivery time for the service requested.
Avoid contacting a buyer directly via inbox message. Buyers may view this as spam, and if reported, it will affect your communication flexibility.
This is not a promotional tool. Only share your Gig if it is relevant to a specific Buyer Request.",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 7:25 pm",2020-08-12 18:56:16.661363

You have already linked your local bank account. so use other option na. If you wanna use jazzcash withdraw through “Fiverr revenue card” stop clicking on “withdraw to bank”.
Bank withdrawal will transfer it to your bank not payoneer account.
“Fiverr revenue card” will keep your funds in payoneer account. Use Jazzcash then.",N/A,"Jul 14, 2020 4:02 pm",2020-08-12 18:56:27.504854

Like if the market rate is $1= Rs 167, they’ll offer $1= Rs 164. So if you’re withdrawing $100, you’ll get Rs 16400 instead of Rs16700.
Jazzcash offers you the market rate, $1= Rs 167 as per our example. But it’s more upfront about the deduction and tells you it’ll take 2% of what you transfer.
So if you’re converting $100 via Jazzcash, it will take 2% of 16700 which is Rs. 334 which leaves you with Rs 16366 in your Jazzcash account, almost the same amount as the bank is offering.

It’s a simple 5th grade math. You just need to calculate “average”. Basically sum of all stars divided by amount of orders, that will be your current rating and from there you can start adding more and more completed orders into your calculation to see how many you need.
Or you can google how to do that calculation.",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 5:57 am",2020-08-12 18:57:49.679093

Why can you not just do it yourself?
Here, I’ll hold your hand this time (I’m curious on the exact numbers myself), but you need to learn how to follow simple instructions:
5 orders with 5 star reviews = 5 x 5 = 25
1 order with 4.3 stars = 4.3
1 order with 1.3 stars = 1.3
25 + 4.3 + 1.3 = 30.6
You have 7 reviews, so 30.6 divided by 7 = 4.37
From that, you can just add x amount of 5 star reviews until you end up with whatever star rating you’re looking for.
Do it yourself next time. It’s not hard.",N/A,"Aug 7, 2020 6:34 am",2020-08-12 18:57:52.215018

Keep sharing the gigs
And with requests it’s not show to new sellers bcz it depend upon the level

With no level buyer request is not show…with no level request shows only sometime with one or two requests.
Hope you got what you need.

Much love!",N/A,N/A,N/A,insects44,1,"Hi, I had my first order in exactly 2 months after I started. I guess I was lucky because I did nothing but wait, and I somehow got it. Your gig looks nice, but I think it will be better if your gig images were more light, the photos are kinda dark. Anyways, I hope you get your first order faster than me. If you want to get some orders faster, here is what I, considering myself a successful seller, do and I recommend you to do too:
If you don’t get any orders, update your Gig in every 2 weeks until you get an order. Add better, modern-looking images, descriprion, and a video if possible. If they are already good enough, then you can add some SEO (search engine optimization), so you get in front of other gigs when someone searches for your service in the search bar:
Make sure your tags are what people will search in the search bar. Then:
Use tags all separated, no two words in one tag. Try to use synonyms instead of 2-worded tags. This is what I use:
Use your tags in your title:
Use more of your tags in your description, without making them way too many (I tried my best to add as many tags as possible without making it too much.):
Once you edit a gig, it may disappear from the search for about 24 hours, but you have a chance to get it in front of other gigs once it appears again. If your gig becomes viral (receives a lot of orders), NEVER edit your gig, as it may go back in the search results page.
Apply for buyer requests, they may bring someone to you. If there are no buyer requests, stay online more, and refresh the page more often. If you tried to send proposals and never succeed, here are some tips on how to make your offers work:
Tips For Buyer Requests- From a Seller
Tips for Sellers
One piece of advice commonly given to new sellers is to send buyers an offer over buyer requests. However, often people ask how to send a good offer. Here are some tips I compiled from others and from my own experience. -Make sure to add a friendly greeting -Offer a special deal to the customer that they wouldn’t get otherwise -Make sure your grammar and spelling is top-notch -DO NOT use the same offer letter for every customer. You want to customize the offers to their needs. -Add relevant…
A common problem to new members like you is that they don’t get any buyers. Here are a few reasons:
• There are a lot of gigs offering the same services as yours
• There have better advertisement
• You are not active on Fiverr
○ Covid-19 (Corona Virus)
