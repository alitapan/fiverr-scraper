Now, to have USA listed on their profiles, they have to legally prove it, and pretenders in other parts of the world aren’t going to be able to do that.

Ok, I am so confused now, can anyone explain me what is W9 form and what does it mean to someone who is not in US?
It is only for US citizens. No need to worry about it. It is our tax laws in action. Our government wants to make sure we are paying our taxes. Fiverr will be sending in how much we earn to our tax department.
For U.S. sellers: In case you are new to this, you will be seeing a 1099 form at the start of next year on fiverr in your account. It will be necessary to print that or make a digital copy if you e-file your taxes and include it with your tax return.",N/A,"Aug 11, 2020 11:54 am",2020-08-18 19:19:23.045262

I have a very important question and my account depends on it.
I was born in 2007 june 9th in North America/California/Freemont is Washington dc hospital.
This makes me a U.S citizen, But I lived in the states until I was around 8-9 months old.
Both my parents are Indians so I at the age of 8-9 months I had to move from the states to India .
Now I am 13 years old and have an aadhar card which you get when you live in india for around 5-7 years i think.
This makes me both Indian as well as american.According to a law in india I can live in India legally until im 18 as I am under my fathers visa i think.
I am using a indian number as I have been here for the past 12 years so I have a number that is indian.
Also my parents told me they had to move from freemont to san jose then san jose to san Francisco so we dont have any specific zip code.
So here is the question do I still have to take the test?
Is there anything I can do?
I have already contacting customer support

You can ask for them to help you fill it out, yes, but it’s your account, so the information must be about you. (If, IF, your income is large enough, you’ll be filed as a dependent under their taxes for the 2020 tax-year. For now, all you need to do is submit the info correctly and completely.)

Fiverr Staff",99,"Hi Everyone,
In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.
You will receive a notification on the Fiverr website and an email message asking you to check your status within 30 days, in a form of a short questionnaire.
If in fact you are classified as a US Person*, you will undergo a short process in which you will fill in Form W-9 that contains standard business information to include your contact information, full address and tax forms.
Fiverr will not use the information submitted as part of filling the Form W-9 for any purpose, apart from sending a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities and update your billing address on Fiverr.
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
Please read this article 124 carefully for all the information.
FAQ -
Why are you doing this?

Is “tip” considered a transaction?
Any transaction, including tips is counted toward the 200 transactions. An order and a tip are each seperate transatctions.
Is this for money earned or money withdrawn?
Money earned.
Will Fiverr will start to display our legal names anywhere, or is this all internal only?

The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need.

One thumbnail states ‘EYE-CATCHY’. There is no such phrase. I assume you mean ‘EYE-CATCHING’. No respectable native English speaker is going to hire you if you make such a glaring error.
The other thumbnail states ‘Wordpress’. The brand - one of the most famous in the world is ‘WordPress’. You are selling yourself as a professional WordPress developer, at least get the brandname correct. Note the uppercase ‘P’.

You say you’ve “tried everything”. But you haven’t.
By the way, I’ve not clicked on your gigs to actually read them. As a buyer, the fact you’ve made mistakes on both your thumbnails would be enough to make me look elsewhere.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 5:48 pm",2020-08-18 19:20:38.353446

Welcome to my post. Here is some tips for you.
Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.
Wish you good luck with that

My question from fellow sellers is that can we use 2 seller accounts on the same internet? For almost 8 hours I have to stay at my workplace where we use shared internet. 4 of us have fiver selling accounts. Two of us are offering the same services while the other 2 have different services on Fiver. So can you tell me if it is allowed? If it is not allowed what are its consequences and bad effects on my account?

You can use multiple accounts on the same internet and on same pc/laptop there is no problem with it, but those accounts cannot provide same services, cannot buy/exchange orders and can’t use same withdraw account.
If you use it then all your accounts will get BAN with any notice.
So please make sure about it.
To summarize
The most important rules to take note of in this situation are:
The accounts cannot sell similar services.
The accounts cannot purchase from one another.
The accounts cannot share a withdrawal provider (Paypal/Payoneer).
Thank You.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 3:00 am",2020-08-18 19:21:45.270238

The points I wrote about the same withdrawal account means you cannot use the same PayPal/Payoneer account with same name and same bank account.
If you have your separate accounts with respective names and bank accounts then there is no issues with it you can go head then.
Hope you this clear your doubt.

Your question is on point and the points you said above this may be issue in day to day life with sellers.
But this Fiverr policy has both their advantage and disadvantage at some level to protect buyers.
I think Fiverr need to allow multiple accounts on same internet/IP providing similar gigs by verifying their legal documents.

If you can’t find a seller who provides what you are looking for by browsing the relevant categories/subcategories (the method most forum users recommend), you can use the Buyer Request feature (1st link: how it works) to ask for specific things; sellers who think they can provide it will send you an offer then.

Although you have read, agreed to and accepted the Fiverr Terms of Service (ToS), you have probably not paid enough attention to it.
So the first tip is to read https://www.fiverr.com/terms_of_service. I know it is long, maybe hard to understand, full of new words, etc but still worth to do it.
You would also find there that it is allowed to post 7 Gigs for Sellers without a Level status (means you).
You would not have any problems with your Account and/or Gigs if you do not violate ToS, therefore it is so essential to read it at least and understand as best.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 4:58 am",2020-08-18 19:22:20.696397

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:20 am",2020-08-18 19:22:34.939788

Moderator",1,"Stricktly speaking, Jon, the two are different. Reviews here are visible whether or not you’re logged in. On downverk not so much.
My feeling about it is that you can probably take screenshots of reviews on Fiverr and put them on other sites - like a website or youtube, for example. However, I think that the need to log in to downverk probably means they consider everything published on their platform to be their copyright.
Either way - yours or mine! - the OP should probably not post downverk reviews on Fiverr … although they may be able to add images of that work to their portfolio, so long as the images don’t compromise client confidentiality …",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 6:17 am",2020-08-18 19:22:45.684998

@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.

You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

That’s why I always thought that the ability to post on the forum should be restricted until you reach level 1.

there’s no secret formula for secured success on Fiverr and that’s what these people are basically asking. “Hey give me the recipe and I’ll make you a pie!” – it doesn’t work like this.
People who don’t spend 2 seconds looking up the solution to their own problems aren’t going to listen to you, whatever advice you give. Yes they will say “Thank you for your great advice” and then forget about it. And let’s be honest, most advice is about working harder and making your Gigs better, and that’s just something you know these people aren’t going to do because they’re looking for the Pie Recipe of Point 1.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:04 am",2020-08-18 19:24:06.014536

some of the pros and cons of the job
Hmmm that’s a tough one.
Pros
I guess having a voice in how things are to be handled would be the biggest pro for me. It didn’t lead to any sales but I guess there was some kind of gratitude or respect from decent forum people.
The ability to close threads with a sarcastic closing comment was probably my favorite thing.
That and working alongside a great team of mods which is something I hasn’t realised I missed since starting freelancing.
Cons
People assuming that you will wrap them in bubble wrap and kiss all their booboos away. The type that when you respond naturally as you should, they say things like ""but you’re a mod, you can’t…""
Having to take action on people you actually like and respect is a tough one.
Having to close interesting threads because there are rules being repeatedly broken, although I tried to avoid that as much as possible.
And the time it can take up although that was my own fault for lacking the discipline to just leave stuff.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:08 am",2020-08-18 19:24:07.975509

I was a moderator for a few weeks. I found it too time intensive. It’s not about looking at the forum for 15-minutes a day. You have to get updates from other Mods, stay up to speed with the Mod scene, double check rules and guidelines, etc. All that is fine if you have the time for it. However, I didn’t and I definitely wouldn’t these days.
Now I’m actually of the opinion that it is a bit cheeky for Fiverr to just not hire a few Mods.
Think about it this way. If the perks are so awesome, why aren’t all the old Mods still Moderating?

I love how one former Mod and one aspiring Mod liked my since flagged post.
This does bring up an interesting aspect of mods - there are set rules of course but personal opinion and common sense are far more important. If I were modding I would have laughed at your post as I did when I saw it and read it in the context and tongue-in-cheekness that it was intended.
However, someone may have then flagged it and I would then have to reconsider it in the light of the rules. In that case you have to weigh up the rules broken and stuff, maybe discuss it with another mod etc. That’s when it gets time consuming as you can imagine.",N/A,"May 28, 2020 2:26 pm",2020-08-18 19:24:22.264644

@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.

Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Did you receive notifications from Fiverr to your email regarding money withdrawal ?
Did you receive notifications from Paypal to your email regarding Fiverr sending you money ?
You need to talk to Paypal customer support directly, Paypal India team on Facebook is active and responds. You can also try to contact them through other social media accounts like Twitter, etc
If you have not filled the essential information like bank details etc which is important for PayPal then fill it out and if you have no knowledge then try to ask Paypal support team or someone Freelancers who are active of FB, etc that may help you.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:21 am",2020-08-18 19:25:28.588630

Here is some tips for you.These will help you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Because there’s tons of amazing talent to be discovered on Fiverr. But today we’re launching a simple way to help your Gig stand out from the rest, introducing Promoted Gigs.
Promoted Gigs provides talented and experienced freelancers on Fiver the opportunity to grow and expand their business with only a few clicks. With Promoted Gigs, high-quality freelancers on Fiverr now have the chance to amplify and enhance their business as well as grow their revenue.
What are the other benefits of Promoted Gigs?
Show your Gigs in prime locations. Once your bid is accepted, it will appear in the most desirable area of the page — the top.
Pay only for results. You’ll only pay for valid clicks, not traffic — so you won’t be charged unless someone clicks on your Gig.
Control the amount you spend . Set a daily limit to help control how much you spend, and update your daily limit daily to continue to outbid your competitors for prime placements.
Boost your revenue, maximize your visibility, and get your Gig in front of more buyers.

If it’s to make things more appealing for buyers in general that’s something Fiverr could do with the search results by themselves.
It’s like why would someone do a book promotion if they needed many reviews of the book already? They do book promotion to start the sales off and get the reviews really. So Fiverr requiring a minimum of 30 reviews for a gig to be promoted doesn’t seem the best thing to do really. I might want the promotion to start a new-ish gig off, to start getting sales on it (assuming I was one of the people who had this feature).",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 2:21 pm",2020-08-18 19:26:54.859104

There was no search problem, it was all made up by fiverr.
Secondly, i personally think that this feature wont work.

So basically you gonna put Level 2 and TRS against one another in bidding to place their GIGs on the first page?
We shall see the outcome.
donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-08-18 19:27:05.522775

My most popular gig is currently not on the first page of search results, but it does not qualify for this program, since it isn’t within a category currently open to ads. I do have a logo design gig that qualifies, but I do not yet have access to the ads platform.

It is super unfair that there are some newly joined sellers that have waay more experience in a certain area than say one “top rated seller”.
Claimed experience in the past, has very little to do with what buyers see in the present. When buyers look at the services of a TRS, they see a hard-built reputation on this site, with reviews, testimonials, buyer samples, etc. When buyers look at a new seller, they see an unproven risk, and a seller with no social proof of his/her claimed skills. More often than not, a buyer is going to hire the proven professional with reviews, samples, and social proof. That’s usually how business works no matter where you go. It is, therefore, unrealistic to claim this to be unfair. We all start at the bottom and work our way up. New sellers need to work hard to prove themselves… TRS sellers have already done this. That’s just how business works.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-08-18 19:27:21.047277

Also if your gigs are okay re: the requirements, another reason you might not be able to see it is because sellers are manually picked for it currently according to the help page (it says “only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics…”).",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:14 am",2020-08-18 19:27:25.696452

I really don’t work on other platforms because Fiverr is superior in every way. So to have a scare like this is unfortunate. Literally the entire world has so much to worry about, this was one place I felt a little bit secure.
Hopefully, time will work out the kinks.
I have put so much effort into my gigs and portfolio and it would be a shame for new buyers to not have many choices on the first pages. As of now the same people are showing up day after day in the front pages. Great for them! Not so great for the rest. I just wonder how much more the revenue is from ads rather than TRS bringing in their normal revenue.
Well let’s try to stay positive. This too shall pass.
I have been on Fiverr long enough to realize there are ups and downs. When I have a down turn it gives me a much needed chance to catch my breath and relax.

Competitors can easily click on your gig and make you pay for basically nothing.
That happens on Google sometimes. Some competitors want to exhaust your advertising budget so they click on your ads. Don’t know if that will happen on Fiverr. Sometimes when I search using filters, I can find my gig on the first three rows.
creativezoone:
If my gig has been deleted - How could be show in promoted gig? - even i’m not able to view that gig.
Can your deleted gig be rescued? Or was it deleted forever? Maybe they want you to activate it again, perhaps with higher prices (I’m assuming you were charging $5 or $10 before, I could be wrong)
donnovan86:
Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom.
If you ever gotten an order from a stranger, chances are your gig was on page 1, at least for a while. I think that’s what happen to me with my other gigs, the ones that don’t get enough impressions. Today I got an order for Google ads, I haven’t gotten an order from that gig in three months, maybe longer. I wonder if the buyer used a filter, maybe he searched for sellers that were online or wanted someone that delivers in 5 days instead of 7.

My average sale price is $94. All I can say is I hope it’s financially worth it for Fiverr to loose out on our incoming revenue.
Fiverr isn’t like a traditional company where profitable employees are protected. Fiverr has inflexible standards, you could be a TRS, you could be making $10,000 a month, but if your Order Completion Rate falls to 89%, you’ll be demoted to level 2.
It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
Also, Fiverr has taught me they don’t believe in tradition, they’re willing to change anything and everything at any time for any reason.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 5:55 pm",2020-08-18 19:27:30.680117

Truth be told, the ads program would be completely overwhelmed if New Sellers and Level 1 sellers – most of whom don’t have any experience as freelancers – started spamming their gigs in ads. The program is a way to supplement a seller’s marketing efforts, not a substitute for sellers who have done nothing to reach out to their target markets.

It looks like Fiverr views the program as a bonus for sellers who have worked hard to become higher level sellers.
I don’t see how it’s a bonus when my views have plummeted and got lower every day since the program has launched. It seems to become a necessity. I am curious if other level 2 and top rated sellers have less views and no messages from new customers. It’s definitely happening to me.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 5:21 am",2020-08-18 19:27:34.370575

Fiverr says:
To ensure a quality ad experience for the buyers, only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics can participate in this program.
Fiverr Pros are hand-vetted for different subcategories but many or most Pro gigs seem to have less than 30 reviews (maybe especially the higher priced ones) so many wouldn’t be able to be promoted with this, despite them being hand-vetted/quality gigs according to Fiverr.
Maybe they might make a different rule for Pro services or maybe Fiverr don’t want them promoted with this (eg. because Fiverr promote them enough in other places).",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 6:39 am",2020-08-18 19:27:35.125674

It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
You said it perfectly! My order requirements are a bit more strong because it forces buyers to think about what they are giving me. It’s a total team effort and buyers have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the project too. I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue. The quality of your work and your buyers who love your work, will in time, be a repeat-business machine! That is what all business owners want… 80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Ads will only get you poised in the right spot but you better be ready to serve as a professional.
I have changed my mind on the ads. At first it seemed like things were changing on the first two pages. But like always, I was just patient and used my down time to improve my portfolio, gigs and demo. I am actually grateful for those few weeks. I see an increase in new and great buyers. So somehow they are still finding me.
I already know sellers who are opting out of the Ad program after paying for ads because the results are not as organic. I am sure it’s paying off for others. I am just going to stay positive and hope the ads are successful.
My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night. You build it and they will find you.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 2:03 pm",2020-08-18 19:27:51.460730

My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night. You build it and they will find you.

I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue.
I used to have 5 to 15 in my queue and always rushing since I had to deliver in 3 days or less. Then 4 or 5 days later, I would get revision requests. Sometimes I was so impatient I would simply refund an order, or refuse to revise, get a bad review, then write an insulting response. It was a different Fiverr, the Wild West era.
melissaharlowvo:
80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Now when you create brand names, unless you get those buyers to order your other gigs.

So to get results with the ADS you need follow your statics, the ADS don’t will help you if you don’t see this statics to keep improving it. I geted a good order with the Ads and spended just $3.39 of the $10 gift from Fiverr.

I don’t have the option, so such experience posts are really interesting. Did you or do you think you got orders out of it?
What I’m wondering is, if, as I’ve read, you can only use ads with already popular gigs, wouldn’t actually interested buyers keep clicking your gig anyway, promoted or not, and would you perhaps rather pay for curious or malicious sellers clicking them?
If someone could clearly say they got orders from advertising, that would be good to know.
I’m assuming you might be able to see it, like you can also see when you got an order from a gig while it was ‘Fiverr’s Choice’.
And do you get a bill from Fiverr for the ads, so that you would be able to file the cost as expenses for income tax?",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-18 19:27:55.572137

Yes i received one order, you can track the order that came from ads. The Promotion Ads still in beta, so certainly they will fix eventualy problems… i’m using the Gift from Fiverr to test Ads. I recommend read all this topic: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/promoted-gigs 6
I don’t know how will work for “Fiverr’s Choice”, but i think that the better way is be able to track where the order came from… like the ads you can see what order came from ads.
Everything is about test, i think that ADS is more one option to get orders, i believe too that how much early you start to use it better will be for you or maybe this feature can become more difficulty to use in future because the number of the users that will be using it (i don’t know)… but i hope be able to promote my others GIG too, i don’t wanna promote my best seller gig.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:05 am",2020-08-18 19:27:55.918874

that will suppress the exposure to new sellers
New sellers need to learn how to build their own exposure, instead of expecting Fiverr to do it for them. If new sellers were allowed to participate in the ads program, they would quickly swamp the system, and make it useless for it’s intended purpose. Fiverr clearly wants successful, experienced sellers to be the only sellers who are allowed to purchase promotion within their categories.
It’s also worth noting that new sellers don’t have the funds in their Fiverr accounts to purchase promotion. Level 2 and TRS sellers already have earned funds within their accounts to purchase the optional promoted visibility.
bumblepixco:
Already we r not getting enough.
New sellers already have a short-term bump in the search algorithm. It is their responsibility to build upon that, and keep the momentum going. There is no such thing as new sellers, “not getting enough”. New sellers do not deserve everything that they want, just because they want it. New sellers need to earn their success, just like the veteran sellers have done.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:59 am",2020-08-18 19:27:58.458302

Challenge yourself to look beyond the obvious.

And to prove my quality of service, fiverr fails to even give me a chance.
It is not Fiverr’s responsibility to “give you a chance”. You make your own chances. Fiverr does not guarantee sales or top visibility to any seller here on Fiverr. If you want to be successful, YOU need to learn how to make that happen. No one is going to provide you any chances or sales. You need to take creative steps to build your own success. Those who do, achieve.

So only for members who have already found success. While newcomers fumble around in the dark. There is nothing to help new sellers like this program?
For what it’s worth, we don’t have it - we’ve been a Top Rated Seller for about a year now, with gigs in the relevant categories. So right now, I couldn’t tell you why some are being chosen, while others aren’t.
In terms of this not being open to newcomers - whilst this might be a bitter pill to swallow, the decision does make sense. Have a look at the main page of this forum, and count in a day the number of people posting “How do I make more sales?” posts. Then look at the quality of their gigs. 9 times out of 10, they are sub-par (to be polite). Now think of how many people don’t post on the forum, but still slap together some garbage gigs and assume they should be getting sales. Hundreds, if not thousands every day. Do you really think Fiverr want those gigs on their front search pages?
Promoting gigs gives you the potential to be the first thing a buyer sees when they come to Fiverr, potentially a buyer who is brand new to Fiverr. Fiverr want those buyers to have a good impression of the site. So yeah, I think it makes sense to only allow sellers and gigs with a proven track record to take those spots, at least for the time being. Fiverr want to do all they can to make the experience for the buyer positive, and that benefits all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats.
Is it fair? Yes, and no. No because I get that there are some amazing new sellers who would love to pay their way to the top spot, but won’t be able to. And Yes, because new members will just have to prove themselves the old-fashioned way, just like the rest of us did when we started out.
It may not be like this forever - perhaps, as time goes on, they’ll open this up to more people. But right now, I think it’s the right call.",N/A,"Aug 13, 2020 11:10 am",2020-08-18 19:28:01.876626

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:23 am",2020-08-18 19:28:31.633813

In my payoneer account there is a card created under USD currency from some bank or america or something.
My issue is that everytime i make a withdrawal from my fiverr account it gives me the option to select a payment method out of the two options of which one charges $3 and transfers money within a couple of hours and the other for $1 and sends the money in like 2 days!!
My problem is that even though when i select the “BANK TRANSFER” option on fiverr, My money only goes to THIS CARD THEY HAVE created!!!
Please tell me a way to get rid of that card and how i directly transfer my money to my bank account !!
P.S- I have already added 3 bank accounts to my payoneer account which have been already approved !
Thank you !",N/A,"Nov 13, 2019 8:26 pm",2020-08-18 19:29:00.411598

I do not know a whole lot about these payment systems but it seems that when you selected a payment method for your revenue, you selected the fiverr revenue card instead which would be the payoneer account. If that is the case, you can’t use the bank transfer. Only one method out of the other methods you would have the option to use. Perhaps you could login to your payoneer account and select the option to transfer to your bank account instead. If it possible to do in your region/country.",N/A,"Nov 14, 2019 10:32 am",2020-08-18 19:29:00.803937

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:18 am",2020-08-18 19:29:34.076966

The order states ‘delivered’ in the sales tab. I’ve read on forums that once an order has been delivered, and the buyer hasn’t left a review, it auto completes after three days unless he rejects it.
