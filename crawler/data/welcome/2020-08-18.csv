Fiverr Staff",97,"Hi Everyone,
In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.
You will receive a notification on the Fiverr website and an email message asking you to check your status within 30 days, in a form of a short questionnaire.
If in fact you are classified as a US Person*, you will undergo a short process in which you will fill in Form W-9 that contains standard business information to include your contact information, full address and tax forms.
Fiverr will not use the information submitted as part of filling the Form W-9 for any purpose, apart from sending a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities and update your billing address on Fiverr.
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
Please read this article 122 carefully for all the information.
FAQ -
Why are you doing this?
When Fiverr is required under applicable laws, it will send a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities. Currently, this applies to US-based sellers who earned at least $20,000 in that year and had at least 200 separate orders.
Is “tip” considered a transaction?
Any transaction, including tips is counted toward the 200 transactions. An order and a tip are each seperate transatctions.
Is this for money earned or money withdrawn?
Money earned.
Will Fiverr will start to display our legal names anywhere, or is this all internal only?
In certain circumstances, we may disclose the data in your W-9 form, with applicable US tax authorities, or as otherwise required by applicable law. None of this information will be displayed publicly on Fiverr.

I was thinking the very same thing. With this requirement, there is no possible way for fraudsters to keep pretending they are from the USA. Now, to have USA listed on their profiles, they have to legally prove it, and pretenders in other parts of the world aren’t going to be able to do that. They’ll either have to be listed with their native country, or their accounts will be banished from Fiverr.

I have a very important question and my account depends on it.
I was born in 2007 june 9th in North America/California/Freemont is Washington dc hospital.
This makes me a U.S citizen, But I lived in the states until I was around 8-9 months old.
Both my parents are Indians so I at the age of 8-9 months I had to move from the states to India .
Now I am 13 years old and have an aadhar card which you get when you live in india for around 5-7 years i think.
This makes me both Indian as well as american.According to a law in india I can live in India legally until im 18 as I am under my fathers visa i think.
I am using a indian number as I have been here for the past 12 years so I have a number that is indian.
Also my parents told me they had to move from freemont to san jose then san jose to san Francisco so we dont have any specific zip code.
So here is the question do I still have to take the test?
Is there anything I can do?
I have already contacting customer support

You can use multiple accounts on the same internet and on same pc/laptop there is no problem with it, but those accounts cannot provide same services, cannot buy/exchange orders and can’t use same withdraw account.
If you use it then all your accounts will get BAN with any notice.
So please make sure about it.
To summarize
The most important rules to take note of in this situation are:
The accounts cannot sell similar services.
The accounts cannot purchase from one another.
The accounts cannot share a withdrawal provider (Paypal/Payoneer).
Thank You.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 3:00 am",2020-08-18 14:51:18.442588

The points I wrote about the same withdrawal account means you cannot use the same PayPal/Payoneer account with same name and same bank account.
If you have your separate accounts with respective names and bank accounts then there is no issues with it you can go head then.

Your question is on point and the points you said above this may be issue in day to day life with sellers.

I think Fiverr need to allow multiple accounts on same internet/IP providing similar gigs by verifying their legal documents.

If you can’t find a seller who provides what you are looking for by browsing the relevant categories/subcategories (the method most forum users recommend), you can use the Buyer Request feature (1st link: how it works) to ask for specific things; sellers who think they can provide it will send you an offer then.

Although you have read, agreed to and accepted the Fiverr Terms of Service (ToS), you have probably not paid enough attention to it.
So the first tip is to read https://www.fiverr.com/terms_of_service. I know it is long, maybe hard to understand, full of new words, etc but still worth to do it.
You would also find there that it is allowed to post 7 Gigs for Sellers without a Level status (means you).
You would not have any problems with your Account and/or Gigs if you do not violate ToS, therefore it is so essential to read it at least and understand as best.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 4:58 am",2020-08-18 14:51:54.576142

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:20 am",2020-08-18 14:52:09.144865

Moderator",0,"Stricktly speaking, Jon, the two are different. Reviews here are visible whether or not you’re logged in. On downverk not so much.
My feeling about it is that you can probably take screenshots of reviews on Fiverr and put them on other sites - like a website or youtube, for example. However, I think that the need to log in to downverk probably means they consider everything published on their platform to be their copyright.
Either way - yours or mine! - the OP should probably not post downverk reviews on Fiverr … although they may be able to add images of that work to their portfolio, so long as the images don’t compromise client confidentiality …",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 6:17 am",2020-08-18 14:52:20.175658

While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.

You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.

some of the pros and cons of the job
Hmmm that’s a tough one.
Pros
I guess having a voice in how things are to be handled would be the biggest pro for me. It didn’t lead to any sales but I guess there was some kind of gratitude or respect from decent forum people.
The ability to close threads with a sarcastic closing comment was probably my favorite thing.
That and working alongside a great team of mods which is something I hasn’t realised I missed since starting freelancing.
Cons
People assuming that you will wrap them in bubble wrap and kiss all their booboos away. The type that when you respond naturally as you should, they say things like ""but you’re a mod, you can’t…""
Having to take action on people you actually like and respect is a tough one.
Having to close interesting threads because there are rules being repeatedly broken, although I tried to avoid that as much as possible.
And the time it can take up although that was my own fault for lacking the discipline to just leave stuff.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:08 am",2020-08-18 14:54:01.713095

Can a moderator tell me how much time they dedicate to this each week?
I was a moderator for a few weeks. I found it too time intensive. It’s not about looking at the forum for 15-minutes a day. You have to get updates from other Mods, stay up to speed with the Mod scene, double check rules and guidelines, etc. All that is fine if you have the time for it. However, I didn’t and I definitely wouldn’t these days.
Now I’m actually of the opinion that it is a bit cheeky for Fiverr to just not hire a few Mods.
Think about it this way. If the perks are so awesome, why aren’t all the old Mods still Moderating?

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Fiverr Staff",93,"Moderators help ensure the success of your community by monitoring user activity and flagged items. This forum would not be what it is without active volunteers helping monitor and moderate conversations that happen here.
Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

I guess this exemplifies the true test of Mod-hood. Can you handle being a Mod in a world where there are a lot of very easily offended people? - And can you handle and justify doing that for free?
Or if you yourself are an arguably easily offended person who feels like being a Mod is your true calling, do you think you can pull it off without burning out?",N/A,"May 27, 2020 1:33 pm",2020-08-18 14:54:11.609082

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

I love how one former Mod and one aspiring Mod liked my since flagged post.
This does bring up an interesting aspect of mods - there are set rules of course but personal opinion and common sense are far more important. If I were modding I would have laughed at your post as I did when I saw it and read it in the context and tongue-in-cheekness that it was intended.
However, someone may have then flagged it and I would then have to reconsider it in the light of the rules. In that case you have to weigh up the rules broken and stuff, maybe discuss it with another mod etc. That’s when it gets time consuming as you can imagine.",N/A,"May 28, 2020 2:26 pm",2020-08-18 14:54:16.648190

And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.

Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

Fiverr Staff",93,"Moderators help ensure the success of your community by monitoring user activity and flagged items. This forum would not be what it is without active volunteers helping monitor and moderate conversations that happen here.
Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Did you receive notifications from Fiverr to your email regarding money withdrawal ?
Did you receive notifications from Paypal to your email regarding Fiverr sending you money ?
You need to talk to Paypal customer support directly, Paypal India team on Facebook is active and responds. You can also try to contact them through other social media accounts like Twitter, etc
If you have not filled the essential information like bank details etc which is important for PayPal then fill it out and if you have no knowledge then try to ask Paypal support team or someone Freelancers who are active of FB, etc that may help you.
I hope this helps",N/A,"Aug 15, 2020 4:50 am",2020-08-18 14:54:36.466431

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:21 am",2020-08-18 14:55:24.123716

Here is some tips for you.These will help you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Because there’s tons of amazing talent to be discovered on Fiverr. But today we’re launching a simple way to help your Gig stand out from the rest, introducing Promoted Gigs.
Promoted Gigs provides talented and experienced freelancers on Fiver the opportunity to grow and expand their business with only a few clicks. With Promoted Gigs, high-quality freelancers on Fiverr now have the chance to amplify and enhance their business as well as grow their revenue.

Pay only for results. You’ll only pay for valid clicks, not traffic — so you won’t be charged unless someone clicks on your Gig.
Control the amount you spend . Set a daily limit to help control how much you spend, and update your daily limit daily to continue to outbid your competitors for prime placements.
Boost your revenue, maximize your visibility, and get your Gig in front of more buyers.

So basically you gonna put Level 2 and TRS against one another in bidding to place their GIGs on the first page?
We shall see the outcome.
donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-08-18 14:57:01.179688

Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom. And I qualify for the program. Not saying it’s intentional or anything, but it’s certain some popular gigs are at the bottom and they are obviously encouraged to pay for exposure since they are not getting new messages or customers.
My most popular gig is currently not on the first page of search results, but it does not qualify for this program, since it isn’t within a category currently open to ads. I do have a logo design gig that qualifies, but I do not yet have access to the ads platform. Where a seller’s gigs are, right now, clearly does not relate to the potential for a seller within the ads program. As you know, gigs rotate around regularly.

Please don’t make assumptions. The new ad promotion feature was officially released YESTERDAY. It doesn’t have anything to with your loss of sales over the PAST TWO WEEKS. It is unwise to cast blame on other things, when, in reality, the only person who can make you successful and earn you orders is YOU. If your sales are low, no one else is to blame.

It is super unfair that there are some newly joined sellers that have waay more experience in a certain area than say one “top rated seller”.
Claimed experience in the past, has very little to do with what buyers see in the present. When buyers look at the services of a TRS, they see a hard-built reputation on this site, with reviews, testimonials, buyer samples, etc. When buyers look at a new seller, they see an unproven risk, and a seller with no social proof of his/her claimed skills. More often than not, a buyer is going to hire the proven professional with reviews, samples, and social proof. That’s usually how business works no matter where you go. It is, therefore, unrealistic to claim this to be unfair. We all start at the bottom and work our way up. New sellers need to work hard to prove themselves… TRS sellers have already done this. That’s just how business works.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-08-18 14:57:16.624314

Maybe not. However, since the day the program was released I didn’t receive any message from any new customer. Usually I get at least 2-3 per day. So… that’s strange since this is the third day.

eg. in the “Video & Animation” category they only allow promoted gigs for the “Whiteboard & Animated Explainers” subcategory, not the “Character Animation” subcategory currently.
Also if your gigs are okay re: the requirements, another reason you might not be able to see it is because sellers are manually picked for it currently according to the help page (it says “only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics…”).",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:14 am",2020-08-18 14:57:21.097032

I really don’t work on other platforms because Fiverr is superior in every way. So to have a scare like this is unfortunate. Literally the entire world has so much to worry about, this was one place I felt a little bit secure.
Hopefully, time will work out the kinks.
I have put so much effort into my gigs and portfolio and it would be a shame for new buyers to not have many choices on the first pages. As of now the same people are showing up day after day in the front pages. Great for them! Not so great for the rest. I just wonder how much more the revenue is from ads rather than TRS bringing in their normal revenue.
Well let’s try to stay positive. This too shall pass.
I have been on Fiverr long enough to realize there are ups and downs. When I have a down turn it gives me a much needed chance to catch my breath and relax.

Competitors can easily click on your gig and make you pay for basically nothing.
That happens on Google sometimes. Some competitors want to exhaust your advertising budget so they click on your ads. Don’t know if that will happen on Fiverr. Sometimes when I search using filters, I can find my gig on the first three rows.

If my gig has been deleted - How could be show in promoted gig? - even i’m not able to view that gig.
Can your deleted gig be rescued? Or was it deleted forever? Maybe they want you to activate it again, perhaps with higher prices (I’m assuming you were charging $5 or $10 before, I could be wrong)

My average sale price is $94. All I can say is I hope it’s financially worth it for Fiverr to loose out on our incoming revenue.
Fiverr isn’t like a traditional company where profitable employees are protected. Fiverr has inflexible standards, you could be a TRS, you could be making $10,000 a month, but if your Order Completion Rate falls to 89%, you’ll be demoted to level 2.
It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.

Fiverr Pros are hand-vetted for different subcategories but many or most Pro gigs seem to have less than 30 reviews (maybe especially the higher priced ones) so many wouldn’t be able to be promoted with this, despite them being hand-vetted/quality gigs according to Fiverr.
Maybe they might make a different rule for Pro services or maybe Fiverr don’t want them promoted with this (eg. because Fiverr promote them enough in other places).",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 6:39 am",2020-08-18 14:57:30.758189

It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
You said it perfectly! My order requirements are a bit more strong because it forces buyers to think about what they are giving me. It’s a total team effort and buyers have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the project too. I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue. The quality of your work and your buyers who love your work, will in time, be a repeat-business machine! That is what all business owners want… 80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Ads will only get you poised in the right spot but you better be ready to serve as a professional.
I have changed my mind on the ads. At first it seemed like things were changing on the first two pages. But like always, I was just patient and used my down time to improve my portfolio, gigs and demo. I am actually grateful for those few weeks. I see an increase in new and great buyers. So somehow they are still finding me.
I already know sellers who are opting out of the Ad program after paying for ads because the results are not as organic. I am sure it’s paying off for others. I am just going to stay positive and hope the ads are successful.
My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night.

I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue.
I used to have 5 to 15 in my queue and always rushing since I had to deliver in 3 days or less. Then 4 or 5 days later, I would get revision requests. Sometimes I was so impatient I would simply refund an order, or refuse to revise, get a bad review, then write an insulting response. It was a different Fiverr, the Wild West era.

I noticed that my promotion stop to receive clicks, the reason is the value of the BID… if you realize that you are not receiving more clicks, you need incrise the value.
So to get results with the ADS you need follow your statics, the ADS don’t will help you if you don’t see this statics to keep improving it. I geted a good order with the Ads and spended just $3.39 of the $10 gift from Fiverr.
The ADS will work as a auction, who are dispost to pay more per click will win the auction, but is not a guarantee of receive an order. This is why you will need improve your gigs to conquest new customers.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 10:27 am",2020-08-18 14:57:49.574137

I don’t have the option, so such experience posts are really interesting. Did you or do you think you got orders out of it?
What I’m wondering is, if, as I’ve read, you can only use ads with already popular gigs, wouldn’t actually interested buyers keep clicking your gig anyway, promoted or not, and would you perhaps rather pay for curious or malicious sellers clicking them?
If someone could clearly say they got orders from advertising, that would be good to know.
I’m assuming you might be able to see it, like you can also see when you got an order from a gig while it was ‘Fiverr’s Choice’.
And do you get a bill from Fiverr for the ads, so that you would be able to file the cost as expenses for income tax?",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-18 14:57:51.724135

Yes i received one order, you can track the order that came from ads. The Promotion Ads still in beta, so certainly they will fix eventualy problems… i’m using the Gift from Fiverr to test Ads. I recommend read all this topic: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/promoted-gigs 6
I don’t know how will work for “Fiverr’s Choice”, but i think that the better way is be able to track where the order came from… like the ads you can see what order came from ads.
Everything is about test, i think that ADS is more one option to get orders, i believe too that how much early you start to use it better will be for you or maybe this feature can become more difficulty to use in future because the number of the users that will be using it (i don’t know)… but i hope be able to promote my others GIG too, i don’t wanna promote my best seller gig.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:05 am",2020-08-18 14:57:52.071788

that will suppress the exposure to new sellers
New sellers need to learn how to build their own exposure, instead of expecting Fiverr to do it for them. If new sellers were allowed to participate in the ads program, they would quickly swamp the system, and make it useless for it’s intended purpose. Fiverr clearly wants successful, experienced sellers to be the only sellers who are allowed to purchase promotion within their categories.
It’s also worth noting that new sellers don’t have the funds in their Fiverr accounts to purchase promotion. Level 2 and TRS sellers already have earned funds within their accounts to purchase the optional promoted visibility.
bumblepixco:
Already we r not getting enough.
New sellers already have a short-term bump in the search algorithm. It is their responsibility to build upon that, and keep the momentum going. There is no such thing as new sellers, “not getting enough”. New sellers do not deserve everything that they want, just because they want it. New sellers need to earn their success, just like the veteran sellers have done.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:59 am",2020-08-18 14:57:54.682522

So only for members who have already found success. While newcomers fumble around in the dark. There is nothing to help new sellers like this program?
For what it’s worth, we don’t have it - we’ve been a Top Rated Seller for about a year now, with gigs in the relevant categories. So right now, I couldn’t tell you why some are being chosen, while others aren’t.
In terms of this not being open to newcomers - whilst this might be a bitter pill to swallow, the decision does make sense. Have a look at the main page of this forum, and count in a day the number of people posting “How do I make more sales?” posts. Then look at the quality of their gigs. 9 times out of 10, they are sub-par (to be polite). Now think of how many people don’t post on the forum, but still slap together some garbage gigs and assume they should be getting sales. Hundreds, if not thousands every day. Do you really think Fiverr want those gigs on their front search pages?
Promoting gigs gives you the potential to be the first thing a buyer sees when they come to Fiverr, potentially a buyer who is brand new to Fiverr. Fiverr want those buyers to have a good impression of the site. So yeah, I think it makes sense to only allow sellers and gigs with a proven track record to take those spots, at least for the time being. Fiverr want to do all they can to make the experience for the buyer positive, and that benefits all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats.
Is it fair? Yes, and no. No because I get that there are some amazing new sellers who would love to pay their way to the top spot, but won’t be able to. And Yes, because new members will just have to prove themselves the old-fashioned way, just like the rest of us did when we started out.
It may not be like this forever - perhaps, as time goes on, they’ll open this up to more people. But right now, I think it’s the right call.",N/A,"Aug 13, 2020 11:10 am",2020-08-18 14:57:58.159352

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:23 am",2020-08-18 14:58:27.734675

In my payoneer account there is a card created under USD currency from some bank or america or something.
My issue is that everytime i make a withdrawal from my fiverr account it gives me the option to select a payment method out of the two options of which one charges $3 and transfers money within a couple of hours and the other for $1 and sends the money in like 2 days!!
My problem is that even though when i select the “BANK TRANSFER” option on fiverr, My money only goes to THIS CARD THEY HAVE created!!!
Please tell me a way to get rid of that card and how i directly transfer my money to my bank account !!
P.S- I have already added 3 bank accounts to my payoneer account which have been already approved !
Thank you !",N/A,"Nov 13, 2019 8:26 pm",2020-08-18 14:58:56.627201

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:18 am",2020-08-18 14:59:30.661530

The order states ‘delivered’ in the sales tab. I’ve read on forums that once an order has been delivered, and the buyer hasn’t left a review, it auto completes after three days unless he rejects it.

Thank you",N/A,1,"Aug 16, 2020 2:22 pm",uk1000,1,"What subcategory of graphics & design is the gig in?
One of those is for the number of size variations you offer (maybe one could be 3000 pixels wide and another one could be 6000 pixels wide? ie. you could offer to deliver it in 2 different sizes) and the other the number of styles you offer (maybe one could be retro and one could be modern if that’s what you decided).
edit: the help for those 2 says:
“# of size variations: The seller will deliver x of size variations”
“# of styles: Number of different styles included in the package”",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 2:48 pm",2020-08-18 15:00:09.780614
