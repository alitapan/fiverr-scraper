It’s an incredible resource, even for a Top Rated Seller! I still haven’t even listened to all of the episodes yet. There is one about Fiverrs SEO and the Fiverr SEO rep tells you what to do!
It took about 6 months before I started to get business. You will get a little bump from Fiverr in the beginning. They will show your gig in the front pages for a few weeks so you better be ready to serve those buyers when that happens! You need to get some good reviews so you can start to climb the ranks!

Today I studied how Fiverr works from morning to evening. And I created my first tag!!!
I am delighted! ᕙ(＠°▽°＠)ᕗ I want to get better, I think I can get this new experience on this freelance platform.
I saw that beginners can be given advice. Could you share your experience?
I opened a tag by illustration and want to quickly open a tag by logos.
What can help me get my first orders?
“Zur rurhmәt” in advance! (Thank you so much)",N/A,N/A,N/A,sultana1245,1,"Hi! Absolutely right and thankyou a very very much for your valuable advise for me because i am also a newbie in Fiverr.
Thanks again, best of luck.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 10:23 am",2020-08-19 13:14:10.293994

Because there’s tons of amazing talent to be discovered on Fiverr. But today we’re launching a simple way to help your Gig stand out from the rest, introducing Promoted Gigs.
Promoted Gigs provides talented and experienced freelancers on Fiver the opportunity to grow and expand their business with only a few clicks. With Promoted Gigs, high-quality freelancers on Fiverr now have the chance to amplify and enhance their business as well as grow their revenue.
What are the other benefits of Promoted Gigs?
Show your Gigs in prime locations. Once your bid is accepted, it will appear in the most desirable area of the page — the top.
Pay only for results. You’ll only pay for valid clicks, not traffic — so you won’t be charged unless someone clicks on your Gig.
Control the amount you spend . Set a daily limit to help control how much you spend, and update your daily limit daily to continue to outbid your competitors for prime placements.
Boost your revenue, maximize your visibility, and get your Gig in front of more buyers.

I thought it was only for sellers who are level 2 and above (and only hand-picked ones out of those) and so those with lower levels won’t currently see it anywhere.
Correct.
Sellers below L2 are out of ads at the moment. Period.
My point was that some people do not bother to read and just ask question because they can.

If it’s to make things more appealing for buyers in general that’s something Fiverr could do with the search results by themselves.
It’s like why would someone do a book promotion if they needed many reviews of the book already? They do book promotion to start the sales off and get the reviews really. So Fiverr requiring a minimum of 30 reviews for a gig to be promoted doesn’t seem the best thing to do really.

So basically you gonna put Level 2 and TRS against one another in bidding to place their GIGs on the first page?
We shall see the outcome.
donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-08-19 13:15:24.294782

Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom. And I qualify for the program. Not saying it’s intentional or anything, but it’s certain some popular gigs are at the bottom and they are obviously encouraged to pay for exposure since they are not getting new messages or customers.
My most popular gig is currently not on the first page of search results, but it does not qualify for this program, since it isn’t within a category currently open to ads. I do have a logo design gig that qualifies, but I do not yet have access to the ads platform. Where a seller’s gigs are, right now, clearly does not relate to the potential for a seller within the ads program. As you know, gigs rotate around regularly. I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-08-19 13:15:39.412041

in the past two weeks the inquiries dropped, with me, with you and with others people. I’m almost sure that the reason is because the new Promote Gig feature.
Please don’t make assumptions. The new ad promotion feature was officially released YESTERDAY. It doesn’t have anything to with your loss of sales over the PAST TWO WEEKS. It is unwise to cast blame on other things, when, in reality, the only person who can make you successful and earn you orders is YOU. If your sales are low, no one else is to blame. Do some marketing research, and figure out how to better connect to your target customers. That’s how you earn orders.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:04 pm",2020-08-19 13:15:39.779012

It is super unfair that there are some newly joined sellers that have waay more experience in a certain area than say one “top rated seller”.
Claimed experience in the past, has very little to do with what buyers see in the present. When buyers look at the services of a TRS, they see a hard-built reputation on this site, with reviews, testimonials, buyer samples, etc. When buyers look at a new seller, they see an unproven risk, and a seller with no social proof of his/her claimed skills. More often than not, a buyer is going to hire the proven professional with reviews, samples, and social proof. That’s usually how business works no matter where you go. It is, therefore, unrealistic to claim this to be unfair. We all start at the bottom and work our way up. New sellers need to work hard to prove themselves… TRS sellers have already done this. That’s just how business works.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-08-19 13:15:40.167935

I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.
Maybe not. However, since the day the program was released I didn’t receive any message from any new customer. Usually I get at least 2-3 per day. So… that’s strange since this is the third day.

eg. in the “Video & Animation” category they only allow promoted gigs for the “Whiteboard & Animated Explainers” subcategory, not the “Character Animation” subcategory currently.
Also if your gigs are okay re: the requirements, another reason you might not be able to see it is because sellers are manually picked for it currently according to the help page (it says “only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics…”).",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:14 am",2020-08-19 13:15:44.777316

I really don’t work on other platforms because Fiverr is superior in every way. So to have a scare like this is unfortunate. Literally the entire world has so much to worry about, this was one place I felt a little bit secure.
Hopefully, time will work out the kinks.
I have put so much effort into my gigs and portfolio and it would be a shame for new buyers to not have many choices on the first pages. As of now the same people are showing up day after day in the front pages. Great for them! Not so great for the rest. I just wonder how much more the revenue is from ads rather than TRS bringing in their normal revenue.
Well let’s try to stay positive. This too shall pass.
I have been on Fiverr long enough to realize there are ups and downs. When I have a down turn it gives me a much needed chance to catch my breath and relax.

Competitors can easily click on your gig and make you pay for basically nothing.
That happens on Google sometimes. Some competitors want to exhaust your advertising budget so they click on your ads. Don’t know if that will happen on Fiverr. Sometimes when I search using filters, I can find my gig on the first three rows.
creativezoone:
If my gig has been deleted - How could be show in promoted gig? - even i’m not able to view that gig.
Can your deleted gig be rescued? Or was it deleted forever? Maybe they want you to activate it again, perhaps with higher prices (I’m assuming you were charging $5 or $10 before, I could be wrong)
donnovan86:
Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom.
If you ever gotten an order from a stranger, chances are your gig was on page 1, at least for a while. I think that’s what happen to me with my other gigs, the ones that don’t get enough impressions. Today I got an order for Google ads, I haven’t gotten an order from that gig in three months, maybe longer.

My average sale price is $94. All I can say is I hope it’s financially worth it for Fiverr to loose out on our incoming revenue.
Fiverr isn’t like a traditional company where profitable employees are protected. Fiverr has inflexible standards, you could be a TRS, you could be making $10,000 a month, but if your Order Completion Rate falls to 89%, you’ll be demoted to level 2.
It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
Also, Fiverr has taught me they don’t believe in tradition, they’re willing to change anything and everything at any time for any reason.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 5:55 pm",2020-08-19 13:15:49.718627

It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
You said it perfectly! My order requirements are a bit more strong because it forces buyers to think about what they are giving me. It’s a total team effort and buyers have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the project too. I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue. The quality of your work and your buyers who love your work, will in time, be a repeat-business machine! That is what all business owners want… 80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Ads will only get you poised in the right spot but you better be ready to serve as a professional.
I have changed my mind on the ads. At first it seemed like things were changing on the first two pages. But like always, I was just patient and used my down time to improve my portfolio, gigs and demo. I am actually grateful for those few weeks. I see an increase in new and great buyers. So somehow they are still finding me.
I already know sellers who are opting out of the Ad program after paying for ads because the results are not as organic. I am sure it’s paying off for others. I am just going to stay positive and hope the ads are successful.
My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night. You build it and they will find you.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 2:03 pm",2020-08-19 13:16:11.011106

I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue.
I used to have 5 to 15 in my queue and always rushing since I had to deliver in 3 days or less. Then 4 or 5 days later, I would get revision requests. Sometimes I was so impatient I would simply refund an order, or refuse to revise, get a bad review, then write an insulting response. It was a different Fiverr, the Wild West era.

So to get results with the ADS you need follow your statics, the ADS don’t will help you if you don’t see this statics to keep improving it. I geted a good order with the Ads and spended just $3.39 of the $10 gift from Fiverr.

I don’t have the option, so such experience posts are really interesting. Did you or do you think you got orders out of it?
What I’m wondering is, if, as I’ve read, you can only use ads with already popular gigs, wouldn’t actually interested buyers keep clicking your gig anyway, promoted or not, and would you perhaps rather pay for curious or malicious sellers clicking them?
If someone could clearly say they got orders from advertising, that would be good to know.
I’m assuming you might be able to see it, like you can also see when you got an order from a gig while it was ‘Fiverr’s Choice’.
And do you get a bill from Fiverr for the ads, so that you would be able to file the cost as expenses for income tax?",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-19 13:16:15.136533

Yes i received one order, you can track the order that came from ads. The Promotion Ads still in beta, so certainly they will fix eventualy problems… i’m using the Gift from Fiverr to test Ads. I recommend read all this topic: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/promoted-gigs 6
I don’t know how will work for “Fiverr’s Choice”, but i think that the better way is be able to track where the order came from… like the ads you can see what order came from ads.
Everything is about test, i think that ADS is more one option to get orders, i believe too that how much early you start to use it better will be for you or maybe this feature can become more difficulty to use in future because the number of the users that will be using it (i don’t know)… but i hope be able to promote my others GIG too, i don’t wanna promote my best seller gig.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:05 am",2020-08-19 13:16:15.554342

that will suppress the exposure to new sellers
New sellers need to learn how to build their own exposure, instead of expecting Fiverr to do it for them. If new sellers were allowed to participate in the ads program, they would quickly swamp the system, and make it useless for it’s intended purpose. Fiverr clearly wants successful, experienced sellers to be the only sellers who are allowed to purchase promotion within their categories.
It’s also worth noting that new sellers don’t have the funds in their Fiverr accounts to purchase promotion. Level 2 and TRS sellers already have earned funds within their accounts to purchase the optional promoted visibility.
bumblepixco:
Already we r not getting enough.
New sellers already have a short-term bump in the search algorithm. It is their responsibility to build upon that, and keep the momentum going. There is no such thing as new sellers, “not getting enough”. New sellers do not deserve everything that they want, just because they want it. New sellers need to earn their success, just like the veteran sellers have done.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:59 am",2020-08-19 13:16:18.195626

So only for members who have already found success. While newcomers fumble around in the dark. There is nothing to help new sellers like this program?
For what it’s worth, we don’t have it - we’ve been a Top Rated Seller for about a year now, with gigs in the relevant categories. So right now, I couldn’t tell you why some are being chosen, while others aren’t.
In terms of this not being open to newcomers - whilst this might be a bitter pill to swallow, the decision does make sense. Have a look at the main page of this forum, and count in a day the number of people posting “How do I make more sales?” posts. Then look at the quality of their gigs. 9 times out of 10, they are sub-par (to be polite). Now think of how many people don’t post on the forum, but still slap together some garbage gigs and assume they should be getting sales. Hundreds, if not thousands every day. Do you really think Fiverr want those gigs on their front search pages?
Promoting gigs gives you the potential to be the first thing a buyer sees when they come to Fiverr, potentially a buyer who is brand new to Fiverr. Fiverr want those buyers to have a good impression of the site. So yeah, I think it makes sense to only allow sellers and gigs with a proven track record to take those spots, at least for the time being. Fiverr want to do all they can to make the experience for the buyer positive, and that benefits all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats.
Is it fair? Yes, and no. No because I get that there are some amazing new sellers who would love to pay their way to the top spot, but won’t be able to. And Yes, because new members will just have to prove themselves the old-fashioned way, just like the rest of us did when we started out.

It’s no surprise that the demand for logos is on the rise. A great logo is memorable and helps leave a lasting impression. Creating the perfect logo is a journey. Sometimes there’s time for a brief, a brainstorm, and a few sketches, but other times the need for a logo is more immediate. But what if there was one tool that would help streamline the process for both the buyer and seller?
The new Fiverr Logo Maker uses AI-technology and machine learning to pair real, handmade logos from Fiverr designers with relevant buyers, instantly.
We’re determined to harness the power of AI and automation to enhance human productivity, because when used properly, technology can elevate human creativity. While AI plays a critical role in automating certain tasks like data entry and collection, certain skills that require human thinking such as creativity, innovation, storytelling, and social interaction will never be truly automated by machines. As a result, AI will make certain types of work more human, not less.
Fiverr sellers now have the opportunity to monetize their existing design portfolio by instantly producing hundreds of logo permutations using our AI-based tool.
For buyers, the powerful service streamlines the logo creation process allowing them to rapidly personalize and customize original, handmade designs created by Fiverr sellers. Recognizing the risk that automation and AI presents for the creative community, Fiverr Logo Maker is advancing a unique approach that preserves the integrity of human-made logo designs, while giving business buyers a fast and intuitive service to build a logo.

I hope to God you’ve made this copyright infringement bullet-proof.
By “existing design portfolio” do you mean logos sellers have created and uploaded to a design catalog, but not sold? Or do you mean that if I order a logo on Fiverr, I now might have to worry about the same concept art being sold with a few variations to other buyers?

It’s no surprise that the demand for logos is on the rise. A great logo is memorable and helps leave a lasting impression. Creating the perfect logo is a journey.

The new Fiverr Logo Maker uses AI-technology and machine learning to pair real, handmade logos from Fiverr designers with relevant buyers, instantly.
We’re determined to harness the power of AI and automation to enhance human productivity, because when used properly, technology can elevate human creativity. While AI plays a critical role in automating certain tasks like data entry and collection, certain skills that require human thinking such as creativity, innovation, storytelling, and social interaction will never be truly automated by machines. As a result, AI will make certain types of work more human, not less.
Fiverr sellers now have the opportunity to monetize their existing design portfolio by instantly producing hundreds of logo permutations using our AI-based tool.
For buyers, the powerful service streamlines the logo creation process allowing them to rapidly personalize and customize original, handmade designs created by Fiverr sellers. Recognizing the risk that automation and AI presents for the creative community, Fiverr Logo Maker is advancing a unique approach that preserves the integrity of human-made logo designs, while giving business buyers a fast and intuitive service to build a logo.

What happens though when you press the buy button? It looked like I wouldn’t be able to see the price of a logo until I did. In this case, I didn’t in case I stumbled into agreeing to buy before knowing how much I was paying.
Do you see the price before you finalize payment? I’m guessing so. However, it would be nice to know how much a design will cost a little earlier. A lot of the logo concepts the creator came up with for me were from Pro sellers. People might well use this expecting to create an affordable logo, but then feel put off if they suddenly find prices way beyond their budget.
Maybe add clear pricing at the logo customization stage, or at least an estimate to lower bounce rates.

In theory, there could be thousands of new logos added every day.
Over time, this COULD be good, if enough logos are poured in the back-end of the system to ensure that you really are getting a wide variety of options, tailored to your requirement. But how does the system identify a minimal vs a vintage logo for example? Are they tagged? If so, who tags them? The sellers can’t be allowed to do that, as the system would be abused by sellers wanting their logos to appear more than anyone else’s. So that surely means either AI, or a team of Fiverr staff constantly reviewing and categorising logos behind the scenes. Also, as others have mentioned, what happens when poor quality, and/or copyright infringing logos start to creep in? Perhaps Fiverr has controls for this, but they haven’t really mentioned them.
I’m not against this in theory. Let’s face it, Artificial Intelligence is the way the wind is blowing, and no amount of people disliking it is going to stop it. And as @skydesigner has already shown, you can make residual income (which, let’s face it, is the dream… money while you sleep for work you might have done months ago, over and over again).
I’m just not convinced that this has been launched as well as it could have been. The fact that people are already finding that the filters make no difference to your search results kind of proves that this wasn’t ready to come out of the oven just yet.

I still don’t see your point. You are saying that it’s not helpful for buyers? But at the same time you are proposing to get ideas from those “not helpful designs”?
It’s not helpful for buyers as designs are extremely generic and very similar to what you would expect from an existing logo generator.
As for getting ideas from designs, if I was a reseller who knows nothing about logos, I’d pop over to the logo generator. Once there, I’d screencapture some designs to show my end client. If they liked one, I’d then jump over to regular Fiverr and ask a few $5 sellers if they can knock me up asimilar version of te logo selected.
mariashtelle1:
That’s why its different from other logo makers because it’s fully designers vision on how to keep designs, which colours they want to use etc. It is not artificially generated.
Regular logo making software vendors also hire logo designers to come up with concept art. There really isn’t a difference here other than that defined by a bit of marketing spin.
visualstudios:
Am I correct in assuming that the logo marks get recycled and sold again and again, with the only change being the title/tagline?
This was my very first thought. However, the answer I got was:
mjensen415:
All logos must be original work designed by the seller and never previously sold. They are only sold through the logo maker.
However. there seem to be too few logo designs to really make this feasible. Also, if all logos sell for $60 and can only be sold once, I don’t see any incentive for sellers to keep on creating logos for the app. At least, not unless they are forced to because of the logo maker causing organic sales to flatline.
cubittaudio:
I wonder how long it will be before you can type in some text, and audition your voice over from a collection of Fiverr’s VO artists, all recreated in high quality audio…
The day has already arrived:
https://www.notjordanpeterson.com/ 8
With the right AI and enough voice samples, you can imitate anyone’s voice easily. I even heard a dark web rumor that an audio leak of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam during last years protests was an AI-generated audio recording.
All that said, there doesn’t seem to be anything AI about what Fiverr is doing here. They seem more to have just name-dropped AI tech to score PR and marketing points. The second you start using the ‘AI-powered’ logo maker, you realize all the sorting options you have do very little. There is just a standard search filter at work here. In this case, no one needs to call Fiverr Sarah Connor just yet.",N/A,"Feb 14, 2020 5:09 am",2020-08-19 13:16:58.742636

Fiverr Ambassador",13,"As a seller, I like the idea of creating a passive revenue using Fiverr and was selected to submit some designs to logo maker before launch. What I don’t like is that some of the designs uploaded are clearly ripped off or copied from elsewhere. Some of the designs are also poor in terms of just general use of colours, composition and fonts. I won’t show examples here, as I don’t want to call out any seller but there needs to be a better quality control.
I also don’t think this will take away from my own logo services as those who are likely to want to hire someone to make a logo just for them are still likely to want that. This tool is for a different market of buyers.",N/A,"Feb 14, 2020 6:27 am",2020-08-19 13:16:59.474648

non-exclusive
Yep, and there you lost 99% of serious business looking for a logo. A logo design DEMANDS exclusive rights. I won’t pay a cent for a logo mark that others can also buy. It’s worthless.
skydesigner:
For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller retains all ownership rights to the Logo Design, and no ownership or copyrights are granted to the Buyer.
Alright! So the terms are not bad - they are insane. I buy a logo and the designer keeps all ownership and copyright? LOL! Sign me right up!
Only people who are not thinking things through will use this. It’s literally throwing money away - what am I paying for?
Not for the work - that has already been done prior to my purchase.
Not for the rights - seller keeps those.
Not for a logo mark that reflects my unique brand - they are templated, catch-all designs.
I would be better served by just looking at the logos for free and copying them. There’s no way to stop me doing that, and there’s no way sellers have any copyright protection if some company on the other side of the world decide to use one of those logos. Who’s going to sue someone doing that? Not the seller, they don’t have the means or expertise. Will Fiverr start suing people who steal the logo concepts? With what money? And how can they prove I stole any logo that has been sold at least once? I can buy a logo there and then use it for 10 different companies, if I want. It’s a nightmare.
This is a complete, utter fail. Think about it - you said you sold a logo for $60. I just checked your page, and you sell logos for $40. Why would I buy a premade logo for $60, when I can see it, and get in touch with the designer and say “Make me something like this, but UNIQUE for me, and I KEEP THE RIGHTS, and I PAY 20 BUCKS LESS”.
Now, if each logo could only be sold ONCE and then the copyright got transferred to the buyer, I could see a use case for this. I want a logo, I don’t have ideas, I want to pick from a list of options and get it instantly. This would make sense. Some people would pay a premium to get it instantly and to be able to pick from multiple options.
Another way this can work is as a kind of live portfolio - people see a logo they like, and then instead of buying (which we have already established as being a very dumb decision), they’ll contact the designer and ask them for a unique logo.",N/A,"Feb 17, 2020 4:36 pm",2020-08-19 13:17:10.448251

Only idiots will use this. It’s literally throwing money away - what am I paying for?
Hold on a second. As a designer you know that everything (even a logo creation) starts from a target audience.
This logo maker simply has a different target audience. So I’m surprised to hear all this “it defeats the logo purpose”.
There are small businesses, there are local business without online presence, small hobby and crafts makers etc who simply don’t need to pay over 200$ to build a world wide recognised brand. All they need is a nice sign to attract some clients to their business, that’s it, a lot of them don’t care if that logo was sold before or not.
There are also control freaks who just don’t want to trust a designer and want to see what they are getting upfront. By the way, this logo maker allows customisation so clients might ask some changes on a logo for additional price and they will have now custom made logo.
I’m so surprised to see so many people forgetting simple but essential rule about target audiences.
Logo maker might not fit for bigger purposes and bigger brands who need to be unique they simply target different audience.
Logos should be affordable not only for big brands but also for smaller businesses who don’t need their logo to be super unique.
P.S I wouldn’t reply or debate and will leave it here for people to make their mind themselves what is best for their own business.",N/A,"Feb 17, 2020 8:39 pm",2020-08-19 13:17:10.835644

A logo there cost $60, the designer of that logo is selling original, unique logos that you will own for $40 on his gig. At any rate, the logos there must be cheap, because any business willing to spend more money will definitely be interested in owning the rights to the logo. Doesn’t make sense otherwise. The least they could do is, since they are charging as much as they are charging for a unique logo, to sell each logo only once, art gallery style. That would justify the pricing strategy (a bit higher than contacting the designer for the convenience and speed).
The logo maker I saw (maybe they changed it?) doesn’t allow for any real customisation.
It has fake sliders that do nothing. Then it allows you to pick a name and tagline. If there are any options they will be in terms of color palette, and that’s standard fare for logo design and doesn’t impact the logo mark at all. A logo mark in three different colors and text options is still one logo, it’s not 3 different ones. It’s all the same, I don’t call that customisation (maybe I missed something).
As for control freaks, they will surely love to not own their logo, and to see copies of it everywhere. Even their direct competitors can get the same logo if they want, different name and colors, and boom. It’s never a good idea not to own your logo if the project/business is serious at all.",N/A,"Feb 17, 2020 8:45 pm",2020-08-19 13:17:11.194656

It’s about lawyers making a lot of money here in the U.S. They bother with them.
Of course not. Lawyers can pursue if someone copied your logo. And if it’s not trademarked it’s still will be pretty difficult. (Bare in mind that even a lot of big businesses doesn’t trademark their logo because it’s a long and very costly process)
With logo makers it’s all strait forward. When people are buying a premade logo they are signing a contract upfront that others can use that logo. Simple as that.

It’s no surprise that the demand for logos is on the rise. A great logo is memorable and helps leave a lasting impression. Creating the perfect logo is a journey. Sometimes there’s time for a brief, a brainstorm, and a few sketches, but other times the need for a logo is more immediate. But what if there was one tool that would help streamline the process for both the buyer and seller?
The new Fiverr Logo Maker uses AI-technology and machine learning to pair real, handmade logos from Fiverr designers with relevant buyers, instantly.
We’re determined to harness the power of AI and automation to enhance human productivity, because when used properly, technology can elevate human creativity. While AI plays a critical role in automating certain tasks like data entry and collection, certain skills that require human thinking such as creativity, innovation, storytelling, and social interaction will never be truly automated by machines. As a result, AI will make certain types of work more human, not less.
Fiverr sellers now have the opportunity to monetize their existing design portfolio by instantly producing hundreds of logo permutations using our AI-based tool.
For buyers, the powerful service streamlines the logo creation process allowing them to rapidly personalize and customize original, handmade designs created by Fiverr sellers. Recognizing the risk that automation and AI presents for the creative community, Fiverr Logo Maker is advancing a unique approach that preserves the integrity of human-made logo designs, while giving business buyers a fast and intuitive service to build a logo.

I was thinking the very same thing. With this requirement, there is no possible way for fraudsters to keep pretending they are from the USA. Now, to have USA listed on their profiles, they have to legally prove it, and pretenders in other parts of the world aren’t going to be able to do that. They’ll either have to be listed with their native country, or their accounts will be banished from Fiverr.

I have a very important question and my account depends on it.
I was born in 2007 june 9th in North America/California/Freemont is Washington dc hospital.
This makes me a U.S citizen, But I lived in the states until I was around 8-9 months old.
Both my parents are Indians so I at the age of 8-9 months I had to move from the states to India .
Now I am 13 years old and have an aadhar card which you get when you live in india for around 5-7 years i think.
This makes me both Indian as well as american.According to a law in india I can live in India legally until im 18 as I am under my fathers visa i think.
I am using a indian number as I have been here for the past 12 years so I have a number that is indian.
Also my parents told me they had to move from freemont to san jose then san jose to san Francisco so we dont have any specific zip code.
So here is the question do I still have to take the test?
Is there anything I can do?
I have already contacting customer support

Fiverr Staff",104,"Hi Everyone,
In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.

Are “earnings” considered to be the full amount of the order or only the revenue earned by the seller less Fiverr’s fees?

As it is, though, I cannot rely on Fiverr’s very generic analytics, which cannot be exported into any sort of manageable report.

In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.

Fiverr Staff",104,"Hi Everyone,
In the next few day, some of you will see that we (Fiverr) will be asking sellers who are defined as a US Person* to complete a W-9 form regarding their activity on Fiverr.
You will receive a notification on the Fiverr website and an email message asking you to check your status within 30 days, in a form of a short questionnaire.
If in fact you are classified as a US Person*, you will undergo a short process in which you will fill in Form W-9 that contains standard business information to include your contact information, full address and tax forms.
Fiverr will not use the information submitted as part of filling the Form W-9 for any purpose, apart from sending a 1099 form at the end of the year to the applicable tax authorities and update your billing address on Fiverr.
Please note that all sellers are required to check if they need to fill out a Form W-9, regardless of their place of residence. By not doing so, within 30 days, your Gigs will be subject to automatic deactivation.
Please read this article 127 carefully for all the information.
FAQ -

Is “tip” considered a transaction?
Any transaction, including tips is counted toward the 200 transactions. An order and a tip are each seperate transatctions.
Is this for money earned or money withdrawn?

Will Fiverr will start to display our legal names anywhere, or is this all internal only?

The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need.

The other thumbnail states ‘Wordpress’. The brand - one of the most famous in the world is ‘WordPress’. You are selling yourself as a professional WordPress developer, at least get the brandname correct. Note the uppercase ‘P’.
The thumbnails show lack of attention to detail. Look at this way, if you can’t even get your own sales material correct - then you’re not in a position to get a client’s project correct.

Although you have read, agreed to and accepted the Fiverr Terms of Service (ToS), you have probably not paid enough attention to it.
So the first tip is to read https://www.fiverr.com/terms_of_service. I know it is long, maybe hard to understand, full of new words, etc but still worth to do it.
You would also find there that it is allowed to post 7 Gigs for Sellers without a Level status (means you).
You would not have any problems with your Account and/or Gigs if you do not violate ToS, therefore it is so essential to read it at least and understand as best.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 4:58 am",2020-08-19 13:19:42.854444

Welcome to my post. Here is some tips for you.
Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.
Wish you good luck with that

Tips for Sellers
If you want more orders, here’s what you need to do: You need to research, understand, and reach out to your target customers. You need to Study, Understand, and Connect. The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need.

You can use multiple accounts on the same internet and on same pc/laptop there is no problem with it, but those accounts cannot provide same services, cannot buy/exchange orders and can’t use same withdraw account.
If you use it then all your accounts will get BAN with any notice.
So please make sure about it.

The most important rules to take note of in this situation are:
The accounts cannot sell similar services.
The accounts cannot purchase from one another.
The accounts cannot share a withdrawal provider (Paypal/Payoneer).

The points I wrote about the same withdrawal account means you cannot use the same PayPal/Payoneer account with same name and same bank account.
If you have your separate accounts with respective names and bank accounts then there is no issues with it you can go head then.
Hope you this clear your doubt.

Your question is on point and the points you said above this may be issue in day to day life with sellers.
But this Fiverr policy has both their advantage and disadvantage at some level to protect buyers.
I think Fiverr need to allow multiple accounts on same internet/IP providing similar gigs by verifying their legal documents.
But Fiverr is always more supportive to the buyer rather than sellers.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 6:46 am",2020-08-19 13:21:41.193888

If you can’t find a seller who provides what you are looking for by browsing the relevant categories/subcategories (the method most forum users recommend), you can use the Buyer Request feature (1st link: how it works) to ask for specific things; sellers who think they can provide it will send you an offer then.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:20 am",2020-08-19 13:22:16.493285

My feeling about it is that you can probably take screenshots of reviews on Fiverr and put them on other sites - like a website or youtube, for example. However, I think that the need to log in to downverk probably means they consider everything published on their platform to be their copyright.
Either way - yours or mine! - the OP should probably not post downverk reviews on Fiverr … although they may be able to add images of that work to their portfolio, so long as the images don’t compromise client confidentiality …",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 6:17 am",2020-08-19 13:22:26.969390

“I’m sorry, but you’ve already used your one free revision that came with the order. I’m willing to provide one more for free since you’ve [been great at communicating], but any further revisions will cost $X.”

@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.

Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.

There are SO many and there’s so many replies to them already. Every new user can just spend 30 seconds looking up the older topics.
That’s why I always thought that the ability to post on the forum should be restricted until you reach level 1.
Let’s face it, most of the people who post these kinds of posts aren’t going to make it. More importantly, no one here actually wants to help these people. (Of course, no one will say that.)",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:00 am",2020-08-19 13:23:35.371883

there’s no secret formula for secured success on Fiverr and that’s what these people are basically asking. “Hey give me the recipe and I’ll make you a pie!” – it doesn’t work like this.
People who don’t spend 2 seconds looking up the solution to their own problems aren’t going to listen to you, whatever advice you give. Yes they will say “Thank you for your great advice” and then forget about it.

some of the pros and cons of the job
Hmmm that’s a tough one.
Pros
I guess having a voice in how things are to be handled would be the biggest pro for me. It didn’t lead to any sales but I guess there was some kind of gratitude or respect from decent forum people.
The ability to close threads with a sarcastic closing comment was probably my favorite thing.
That and working alongside a great team of mods which is something I hasn’t realised I missed since starting freelancing.
Cons
People assuming that you will wrap them in bubble wrap and kiss all their booboos away. The type that when you respond naturally as you should, they say things like ""but you’re a mod, you can’t…""
Having to take action on people you actually like and respect is a tough one.
Having to close interesting threads because there are rules being repeatedly broken, although I tried to avoid that as much as possible.
And the time it can take up although that was my own fault for lacking the discipline to just leave stuff.",N/A,"May 27, 2020 11:08 am",2020-08-19 13:23:37.540878

Can a moderator tell me how much time they dedicate to this each week?
I was a moderator for a few weeks. I found it too time intensive. It’s not about looking at the forum for 15-minutes a day. You have to get updates from other Mods, stay up to speed with the Mod scene, double check rules and guidelines, etc. All that is fine if you have the time for it. However, I didn’t and I definitely wouldn’t these days.
Now I’m actually of the opinion that it is a bit cheeky for Fiverr to just not hire a few Mods.
Think about it this way. If the perks are so awesome, why aren’t all the old Mods still Moderating?

You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

I love how one former Mod and one aspiring Mod liked my since flagged post.
This does bring up an interesting aspect of mods - there are set rules of course but personal opinion and common sense are far more important. If I were modding I would have laughed at your post as I did when I saw it and read it in the context and tongue-in-cheekness that it was intended.
However, someone may have then flagged it and I would then have to reconsider it in the light of the rules. In that case you have to weigh up the rules broken and stuff, maybe discuss it with another mod etc. That’s when it gets time consuming as you can imagine.",N/A,"May 28, 2020 2:26 pm",2020-08-19 13:23:51.608627

Fiverr Staff",93,"Moderators help ensure the success of your community by monitoring user activity and flagged items. This forum would not be what it is without active volunteers helping monitor and moderate conversations that happen here.
Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.

Over the last few years, there have been some amazing moderators who have, and continue to volunteer their time to help ensure that this community stays on task and conversations here are helpful and civil.
@wp_kid - @annai80 - @fonthaunt - @sue_mcl - @eoinfinnegan to name a few rockstars.
And it’s time we add more people to help us take this community to the next level. I’d love to be able to put together a moderation coalition of many sellers (and buyers) who represent many categories, countries, time zones and view points as this represents Fiverr as a whole.
While the platform (Discourse) has a lot of “self moderating” features built into it already, some human contact is always a good thing. Community members have been able to flag and report improper posts and comments. As well as the built in level system that have limits on posting.
Would you be a good fit to be a moderator?
You are active on the forum and have civil, helpful comments & posts.
You are an active Fiverr Seller or Buyer and have an account in good standing with Fiverr.
The tone of your posts are personable, helpful and welcoming.
You’re able to jump in and commit to moderating 10-15 min blocks, at least 3-4 days per week.
Benefits:
Helping out & grow the community. The rising tide lifts all boats.
“Direct” access to employees at fiverr via a Community Slack Channel.
Exposure (I hate listing this as a benefit to freelancers, but it’s true)
Sometimes swag & gifts (when I can get budget for it)
You get to join a community of moderators!
PHENOMENAL COSMIC (forum) POWERS!
The application form is pretty simple. Keep in mind that we do have access to all your posts & selling history, so we will be vetting each application for both selling habits and Forum activity.
I’ll keep this open until June 1st. Good luck to everyone who applies and I hope to see many applications. Feel free to check out the Community Standards & Forum Rules - 2020 21 if you have questions about WHAT is moderated and if you have any questions, please post below.

Did you receive notifications from Fiverr to your email regarding money withdrawal ?
Did you receive notifications from Paypal to your email regarding Fiverr sending you money ?
You need to talk to Paypal customer support directly, Paypal India team on Facebook is active and responds. You can also try to contact them through other social media accounts like Twitter, etc
If you have not filled the essential information like bank details etc which is important for PayPal then fill it out and if you have no knowledge then try to ask Paypal support team or someone Freelancers who are active of FB, etc that may help you.
