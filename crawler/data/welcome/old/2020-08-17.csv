I just realized that this might put a stop to all of the fake US accounts!
I was thinking the very same thing. With this requirement, there is no possible way for fraudsters to keep pretending they are from the USA. Now, to have USA listed on their profiles, they have to legally prove it, and pretenders in other parts of the world aren’t going to be able to do that. They’ll either have to be listed with their native country, or their accounts will be banished from Fiverr.

I have a very important question and my account depends on it.
I was born in 2007 june 9th in North America/California/Freemont is Washington dc hospital.
This makes me a U.S citizen, But I lived in the states until I was around 8-9 months old.
Both my parents are Indians so I at the age of 8-9 months I had to move from the states to India .
Now I am 13 years old and have an aadhar card which you get when you live in india for around 5-7 years i think.
This makes me both Indian as well as american.According to a law in india I can live in India legally until im 18 as I am under my fathers visa i think.
I am using a indian number as I have been here for the past 12 years so I have a number that is indian.
Also my parents told me they had to move from freemont to san jose then san jose to san Francisco so we dont have any specific zip code.
So here is the question do I still have to take the test?
Is there anything I can do?
I have already contacting customer support

The tax season is considered a calendar year. We did not have a tax season that just ended. It will end at the end of 2020.
You might have meant the tax filing deadline, which was for 2019 and ended in April, although I think this year it was extended past that date.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:21 am",2020-08-17 20:19:22.925722

Welcome to Fiverr. You are new or old in this marketplace, it’s doesn’t matter. I think your skills (which you can show through gigs) are help you to find out a good buyer. And remember one thing that gigs marketing is the most important thing for increasing impressions and clicks.
I’m also new seller. Recently, I worked successfully on Fiverr and the buyer was satisfied and gave me 5 star rating also.

Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:20 am",2020-08-17 20:20:00.259240

So Fiverr requiring a minimum of 30 reviews for a gig to be promoted doesn’t seem the best thing to do really.

So basically you gonna put Level 2 and TRS against one another in bidding to place their GIGs on the first page?

donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-08-17 20:21:28.711933

I don’t believe this is true, because sellers from categories that aren’t even part of the ads program have been complaining about gig placement.

Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom. And I qualify for the program. Not saying it’s intentional or anything, but it’s certain some popular gigs are at the bottom and they are obviously encouraged to pay for exposure since they are not getting new messages or customers.
My most popular gig is currently not on the first page of search results, but it does not qualify for this program, since it isn’t within a category currently open to ads. I do have a logo design gig that qualifies, but I do not yet have access to the ads platform. Where a seller’s gigs are, right now, clearly does not relate to the potential for a seller within the ads program. As you know, gigs rotate around regularly. I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-08-17 20:21:44.016631

in the past two weeks the inquiries dropped, with me, with you and with others people. I’m almost sure that the reason is because the new Promote Gig feature.
Please don’t make assumptions. The new ad promotion feature was officially released YESTERDAY. It doesn’t have anything to with your loss of sales over the PAST TWO WEEKS. It is unwise to cast blame on other things, when, in reality, the only person who can make you successful and earn you orders is YOU. If your sales are low, no one else is to blame. Do some marketing research, and figure out how to better connect to your target customers. That’s how you earn orders.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:04 pm",2020-08-17 20:21:44.368992

It is super unfair that there are some newly joined sellers that have waay more experience in a certain area than say one “top rated seller”.
Claimed experience in the past, has very little to do with what buyers see in the present. When buyers look at the services of a TRS, they see a hard-built reputation on this site, with reviews, testimonials, buyer samples, etc. When buyers look at a new seller, they see an unproven risk, and a seller with no social proof of his/her claimed skills. More often than not, a buyer is going to hire the proven professional with reviews, samples, and social proof. That’s usually how business works no matter where you go. It is, therefore, unrealistic to claim this to be unfair. We all start at the bottom and work our way up. New sellers need to work hard to prove themselves… TRS sellers have already done this. That’s just how business works.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:08 pm",2020-08-17 20:21:44.783002

I do not believe Fiverr is intentionally doing anything to force sellers to participate in the program.
Maybe not. However, since the day the program was released I didn’t receive any message from any new customer. Usually I get at least 2-3 per day. So… that’s strange since this is the third day.

eg. in the “Video & Animation” category they only allow promoted gigs for the “Whiteboard & Animated Explainers” subcategory, not the “Character Animation” subcategory currently.
Also if your gigs are okay re: the requirements, another reason you might not be able to see it is because sellers are manually picked for it currently according to the help page (it says “only hand-vetted sellers who meet all our quality metrics…”).",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:14 am",2020-08-17 20:21:49.536330

I really don’t work on other platforms because Fiverr is superior in every way. So to have a scare like this is unfortunate. Literally the entire world has so much to worry about, this was one place I felt a little bit secure.
Hopefully, time will work out the kinks.
I have put so much effort into my gigs and portfolio and it would be a shame for new buyers to not have many choices on the first pages. As of now the same people are showing up day after day in the front pages. Great for them! Not so great for the rest. I just wonder how much more the revenue is from ads rather than TRS bringing in their normal revenue.
Well let’s try to stay positive. This too shall pass.
I have been on Fiverr long enough to realize there are ups and downs. When I have a down turn it gives me a much needed chance to catch my breath and relax.

Competitors can easily click on your gig and make you pay for basically nothing.
That happens on Google sometimes. Some competitors want to exhaust your advertising budget so they click on your ads. Don’t know if that will happen on Fiverr. Sometimes when I search using filters, I can find my gig on the first three rows.
creativezoone:
If my gig has been deleted - How could be show in promoted gig? - even i’m not able to view that gig.
Can your deleted gig be rescued? Or was it deleted forever? Maybe they want you to activate it again, perhaps with higher prices (I’m assuming you were charging $5 or $10 before, I could be wrong)
donnovan86:
Well I am at the bottom, my entire account, all my gigs are at the bottom.
If you ever gotten an order from a stranger, chances are your gig was on page 1, at least for a while. I think that’s what happen to me with my other gigs, the ones that don’t get enough impressions. Today I got an order for Google ads, I haven’t gotten an order from that gig in three months, maybe longer.

My average sale price is $94. All I can say is I hope it’s financially worth it for Fiverr to loose out on our incoming revenue.
Fiverr isn’t like a traditional company where profitable employees are protected. Fiverr has inflexible standards, you could be a TRS, you could be making $10,000 a month, but if your Order Completion Rate falls to 89%, you’ll be demoted to level 2.
It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.

It took me a long time to understand that. I had to give up my churn and burn philosophy. Had to start working harder on each order, taking my time, rejecting potential clients, never clicking “deliver now” until the client has seen the work and is satisfied, telling people to message me before ordering, etc.
You said it perfectly! My order requirements are a bit more strong because it forces buyers to think about what they are giving me. It’s a total team effort and buyers have to take some responsibility for the outcome of the project too. I would rather have fewer buyers who I can really pay attention too, than 20 orders in my queue. The quality of your work and your buyers who love your work, will in time, be a repeat-business machine! That is what all business owners want… 80% of your sales come from 20% of your buyers.
Ads will only get you poised in the right spot but you better be ready to serve as a professional.
I have changed my mind on the ads. At first it seemed like things were changing on the first two pages. But like always, I was just patient and used my down time to improve my portfolio, gigs and demo. I am actually grateful for those few weeks. I see an increase in new and great buyers. So somehow they are still finding me.
I already know sellers who are opting out of the Ad program after paying for ads because the results are not as organic. I am sure it’s paying off for others. I am just going to stay positive and hope the ads are successful.
My TRS is golden and I appreciate Fiverr in so many ways. I was the type of child who actually had to do chores to get allowance money. Nothing is given to you on Fiverr, you have to earn it… not just by numbers and stats but there is a magical mix of buyer love and appreciation, respect for the customer service team, an inward look at yourself and answering your inquiries in the middle of the night. You build it and they will find you.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 2:03 pm",2020-08-17 20:22:16.567127

So to get results with the ADS you need follow your statics, the ADS don’t will help you if you don’t see this statics to keep improving it. I geted a good order with the Ads and spended just $3.39 of the $10 gift from Fiverr.

I don’t have the option, so such experience posts are really interesting. Did you or do you think you got orders out of it?
What I’m wondering is, if, as I’ve read, you can only use ads with already popular gigs, wouldn’t actually interested buyers keep clicking your gig anyway, promoted or not, and would you perhaps rather pay for curious or malicious sellers clicking them?
If someone could clearly say they got orders from advertising, that would be good to know.
I’m assuming you might be able to see it, like you can also see when you got an order from a gig while it was ‘Fiverr’s Choice’.
And do you get a bill from Fiverr for the ads, so that you would be able to file the cost as expenses for income tax?",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 4:31 am",2020-08-17 20:22:20.809362

Yes i received one order, you can track the order that came from ads. The Promotion Ads still in beta, so certainly they will fix eventualy problems… i’m using the Gift from Fiverr to test Ads. I recommend read all this topic: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/promoted-gigs 5
I don’t know how will work for “Fiverr’s Choice”, but i think that the better way is be able to track where the order came from… like the ads you can see what order came from ads.
Everything is about test, i think that ADS is more one option to get orders, i believe too that how much early you start to use it better will be for you or maybe this feature can become more difficulty to use in future because the number of the users that will be using it (i don’t know)… but i hope be able to promote my others GIG too, i don’t wanna promote my best seller gig.",N/A,"Aug 8, 2020 6:05 am",2020-08-17 20:22:21.219061

that will suppress the exposure to new sellers
New sellers need to learn how to build their own exposure, instead of expecting Fiverr to do it for them. If new sellers were allowed to participate in the ads program, they would quickly swamp the system, and make it useless for it’s intended purpose. Fiverr clearly wants successful, experienced sellers to be the only sellers who are allowed to purchase promotion within their categories.
It’s also worth noting that new sellers don’t have the funds in their Fiverr accounts to purchase promotion. Level 2 and TRS sellers already have earned funds within their accounts to purchase the optional promoted visibility.
bumblepixco:
Already we r not getting enough.
New sellers already have a short-term bump in the search algorithm. It is their responsibility to build upon that, and keep the momentum going. There is no such thing as new sellers, “not getting enough”. New sellers do not deserve everything that they want, just because they want it. New sellers need to earn their success, just like the veteran sellers have done.",N/A,"Aug 10, 2020 4:59 am",2020-08-17 20:22:23.796324

So only for members who have already found success. While newcomers fumble around in the dark. There is nothing to help new sellers like this program?
For what it’s worth, we don’t have it - we’ve been a Top Rated Seller for about a year now, with gigs in the relevant categories. So right now, I couldn’t tell you why some are being chosen, while others aren’t.
In terms of this not being open to newcomers - whilst this might be a bitter pill to swallow, the decision does make sense. Have a look at the main page of this forum, and count in a day the number of people posting “How do I make more sales?” posts. Then look at the quality of their gigs. 9 times out of 10, they are sub-par (to be polite). Now think of how many people don’t post on the forum, but still slap together some garbage gigs and assume they should be getting sales. Hundreds, if not thousands every day. Do you really think Fiverr want those gigs on their front search pages?
Promoting gigs gives you the potential to be the first thing a buyer sees when they come to Fiverr, potentially a buyer who is brand new to Fiverr. Fiverr want those buyers to have a good impression of the site. So yeah, I think it makes sense to only allow sellers and gigs with a proven track record to take those spots, at least for the time being. Fiverr want to do all they can to make the experience for the buyer positive, and that benefits all of us - a rising tide lifts all boats.
Is it fair? Yes, and no. No because I get that there are some amazing new sellers who would love to pay their way to the top spot, but won’t be able to. And Yes, because new members will just have to prove themselves the old-fashioned way, just like the rest of us did when we started out.
It may not be like this forever - perhaps, as time goes on, they’ll open this up to more people. But right now, I think it’s the right call.",N/A,"Aug 13, 2020 11:10 am",2020-08-17 20:22:27.306450

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:23 am",2020-08-17 20:23:13.869753

In my payoneer account there is a card created under USD currency from some bank or america or something.
My issue is that everytime i make a withdrawal from my fiverr account it gives me the option to select a payment method out of the two options of which one charges $3 and transfers money within a couple of hours and the other for $1 and sends the money in like 2 days!!
My problem is that even though when i select the “BANK TRANSFER” option on fiverr, My money only goes to THIS CARD THEY HAVE created!!!
Please tell me a way to get rid of that card and how i directly transfer my money to my bank account !!
P.S- I have already added 3 bank accounts to my payoneer account which have been already approved !
Thank you !",N/A,"Nov 13, 2019 8:26 pm",2020-08-17 20:23:42.825509

If that is the case, you can’t use the bank transfer. Only one method out of the other methods you would have the option to use. Perhaps you could login to your payoneer account and select the option to transfer to your bank account instead.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 1:18 am",2020-08-17 20:24:17.116231

Today, I received my first order and within two and a half hours, I delivered the order, I have messaged the buyer saying it has been delivered, he has been online after the message but hasn’t replied yet. The order states ‘delivered’ in the sales tab. I’ve read on forums that once an order has been delivered, and the buyer hasn’t left a review, it auto completes after three days unless he rejects it. So after three days provided he doesn’t reject the order, will the money for the order be transferred from the buyer to my earnings or not?
I hope this is cleared soon.

One of those is for the number of size variations you offer (maybe one could be 3000 pixels wide and another one could be 6000 pixels wide? ie. you could offer to deliver it in 2 different sizes) and the other the number of styles you offer (maybe one could be retro and one could be modern if that’s what you decided).

Do this, go back to the gig you want to publish. When you get to that last bit, click on the retake test button. It should take you to where you’ll take the test. When you take and pass the test, you can then publish your gig.
this test is different in that the test scores will not be displayed
