My best advice to get a first order (and many more) is to write a good description, pay attention to the keywords that you choose and use a fancy thumbnail. Provide a great service using your skills and establish your rules for your own business.
Please make sure that you look for useful information here at forum and read TOS. It’s really important to know what you can do and what you cannot do at the platform.
Wish you many many sales.",N/A,"Jun 5, 2020 3:20 am",2020-07-31 15:19:23.768509

If it’s to make things more appealing for buyers in general that’s something Fiverr could do with the search results by themselves.
It’s like why would someone do a book promotion if they needed many reviews of the book already? They do book promotion to start the sales off and get the reviews really. So Fiverr requiring a minimum of 30 reviews for a gig to be promoted doesn’t seem the best thing to do really. I might want the promotion to start a new-ish gig off, to start getting sales on it (assuming I was one of the people who had this feature).",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 2:21 pm",2020-07-31 15:20:15.022679

So basically you gonna put Level 2 and TRS against one another in bidding to place their GIGs on the first page?
We shall see the outcome.
donnovan86:
Well this only makes sense for people that have a pricey gig.
Maybe it will be mostly TRS who win the top positions in the searches/categories with promoted gigs as they will probably have the higher priced gigs on average (so they might lose less per sale on average if they promoted their gigs compared to a level 2 seller with a lower price gig).
Maybe also Fiverr Pros with a level 2 or TRS level (or mostly Fiverr Pros who are TRS, depending on the number of them in the subcategory). Though Pro gigs are already promoted more than other gigs.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 4:20 am",2020-07-31 15:20:25.301985

I am starting to think that all the search feature all the users were reporting that their gigs are pushed back, i think it was on purpose by fiverr because they thought the one that are pushed back will pay to bring it back at top, so all this problem was because of them
I don’t believe this is true, because sellers from categories that aren’t even part of the ads program have been complaining about gig placement. Fiverr is/was not intentionally sending seller gigs to the back of the search results, just to force them to pay more to be seen. Why would Fiverr, as you claim, send sellers to the back of the search results who don’t even qualify for the promoted gigs program?",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 6:07 am",2020-07-31 15:20:28.068524

Never do that, it’ll eventually get you into trouble.
catwriter:
Generally speaking, any contact outside of Fiverr can get you permanently banned, unless you had the permission from CS to do it.
That sounds about right.
I had to contact CS because of a very similar issue a few months ago. What I had to do is set up a new Gig which states that I’m going to give advice outside of Fiverr and which apps I’m going to use for that purpose. It should be stated in the gig title, gig description and order requirements. Also, never share that stuff in inbox. You must also advise your customers to not do that. You are only allowed to exchange contact details on the order page of an existing order and only if it is necessary for completion of the order.
And you should definitely contact CS before you do this!",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 2:37 am",2020-07-31 15:20:56.791692

Hi,
I am a UK seller. Since you are also from UK, hence I wanted to ask you for recommendation about earning withdrawal method.
Do you recommend withdrawing using “PP” or “Bank Transfer” ? I have always been withdrawing to PP. But since hearing the recent Payoneer scandal, I am feeling hesitant to withdraw to PP. Also I am looking to reduce the amount of fees I have to pay for foreign exchange rate.
Which option is better to reduce the amount of fees I pay, PP or Bank Transfer?
Do you think PP is still better?
Thank you for your help.

If you want to know what TOS says, why don’t you read it?
Really? This seems like an innocent enough question by OP. I’ve been selling on Fiverr over 3 years and have read the ToS countless times, and this is, honestly, sort of a gray area.
The ToS does say that communication must go through Fiverr, but it also says that personal information may be shared if it is necessary for delivery.
I also know that many top rated sellers offer a video chat consultation before starting on an order, it says so right on their gig page. It is not uncommon.
In my opinion OP, it’s not worth the risk. The ToS contradict themselves a couple times and there are some areas that I think could do with clarifying, but in my opinion this one is worth erring on the side of caution. Even putting “@” in your chat will flag it for review. I’ve had a couple messages stalled for review for saying things like “email” (because the word email was in the script i had to record).
There have also been a couple times where a file was too large to upload to the order page, and my buyer couldn’t figure out how to open a compressed folder, so I had to send them a google drive link. I think this is technically in the weird gray area with the ToS but a lot of people deliver their work via Google Drives or Dropbox, so again, it’s really not clear imo.",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 2:29 am",2020-07-31 15:26:26.403518

This applies only to Pro sellers, who offer an “elite” (and more expensive) service. You have to apply to be a Pro seller. If you are a New Seller, Level 1, Level 2, or Top Rated Seller this does not technically apply to you.
The bottom line is it’s safer to keep everything on the order page or in your inbox.

It is likely that Fiverr hasn’t caught those sellers yet. If you received a warning not to do something, then it is wise not to do it. Fiverr has stated that they don’t want you to use images on your gig that are not your own. You are, therefore, going to have to use your own images in order to abide by Fiverr’s warning/message.",N/A,"Dec 18, 2018 1:11 pm",2020-07-31 15:26:58.420000

I received an order 3 days ago that required me to be invited to a collaborative editing program. I was busy with other orders on the first day and yesterday I finally got around to this order (the gig has a 2-day delivery time). I had some concerns about whether I would be able to complete the order on time so I asked the buyer for a 1-day extension along with asking him to add me to his collaborative game edit.
This was over 36 hours ago and I still haven’t received a reply from this buyer, he is currently “Away” and I’m unable to complete his work and deliver it unless he adds me to his collaborative edit. The order is now 12 hours late and I’m concerned with what will happen if it hits 24 hours. I understand that in regular circumstances, this will result in a cancellation and negative review but will this be the case even if an extension request is open?",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-31 15:28:04.247000

All they have to do is create a gig and they will start selling
They can become Pro and TRS sellers by looking at a chicken and clicking their heels together
Somehow promotions and badges are automatic or given to people who just ask

You are right I have created my profile few years ago hence actively started work only few months ago. In short time I got level one & my clients reviews show my work quality.
Fiver Pro team has declined my request with the following comments, “you have not added reference documents”. Now i want to submit my past work but couldn’t find resubmit/re-apply option there.

Is it necessary to have a gig priced over a $100? I don’t have any such because I wanted to keep the quote low to get more work, reviews and of course, better ranking.

I don’t know the answer to that. Pro sellers have to have a gig for at least $100 but that might happen after they become a Pro seller.
You need to have the reputation, and the value, to have a gig worth $100 at least. That needs to be there before you apply so that you are indeed a Pro quality seller.",N/A,"Oct 26, 2019 6:20 pm",2020-07-31 15:32:46.717691

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 1:44 pm",2020-07-31 15:33:12.757356

Hope you all are doing good.
Well, as being a member of fiverr from last more than 2 years, I faced alot of things and got alot of experience and being a member of this platform fiverr forum I see many open topics specially from newbies asking only thing How to get order?
As being a responsible member or to maintain my trust on others on this forum I replied on many topics, help others in many ways which are possible from my side. But reading alot of questions on same topic, I conclude that there are few tips that I have to share separately instead of giving reply on all the post or the things that you should follow before posting a topic related to how to get order as I see in almost all the topics, people are asking how to get but haven’t implement any of the thing from the following which are so important specially for newbie and much common for the one who is aware with all that.
Please go through the following tips as these are the most important for those who are asking how to get first order or since (this month) haven’t receive any order etc etc.
1- First, and the most childish act which many of you are doing and asking for reviewing your profile,
Description on your profile means, a brief description of what you are and why you are here and what you will do or give to your client.
It doesn’t mean you start writing I am new here and want some work and I will do in free of cost etc etc as I see many newbies are doing this childish acts which is totally wrong and give a bad impact on buyers. So, use this description option to show yourself, not for begging purpose.
2- At No Level fiverr allow to make 5 gigs, so create all 5 gigs even if you have same category.
3- Place a cover photo “eye catching” which can grab the people’s attention easily. Gig covers are the best thing to grab some one’s attention so never try to copy covers from others, always try to come up with something unique.
4- Don’t copy the material from other gigs (specially pictures in graphics designing gigs).
May be this is common for you but buyers notice this alot if you are copying data while creating a gig then how less percent chances there will be that you will deliver something unique.So, try to come up with unique ideas .
5- Just mention the things in your gigs which you can do easily (be HONEST, don’t mention more than your expertise).
6- Use common search tags while creating a gigs. Don’t use unique keywords, because search tags are the most important thing as buyers use the search tags while searching for gigs.
7- As a beginner, start your gig packages with a less amount as this time you have to gain the buyer’s trust. So try to provide your service in a discounted price.
Less amount never means you start offering all the services in 5$, you have to check the market value by visiting multiple gigs, just try to offer little less amount than others.
8- Refresh your gigs on daily basis.
9- Check Buyers Requests frequently.
10- Also, you can share your gig link on social sites like linkedin, facebook pages etc. It can also help you.
All the above points are the most common and important that you should follow before asking for how to get order. These are things I noticed, from the very start nothing is implemented in the profile and in gigs but sellers are pretending like they did alot of efforts but not receiving any order.
After all of this, one thing which is the most important and that is Time. Keep this thing in your mind freelancing is not that easy as you think. You have to give alot of time, you have to gain alot of trust and also you have to wait alot too.
In no any business, no one start getting profit after a month or two. Struggle is the most important thing, indeed. And it is your business, so you have to be motivated, always!
I’m sure, after following all the above points you will receive your order soon. And, after receiving your order, try to give your best to your client, try to do some chit chat with your client to gain his trust, ask everything in detail and deliver your best as much as possible. Because, first review on your profile will be the first impression of your profile.
In the end, I wish you all a very best of luck and yes, Thanks alot for reading this post.
Always be motivated, Never lose Hopes!

There is also a small chance of them creating a new account (or accounts) to contact you. I’ve noticed that you’re offering writing erotica among other things and I’d assume it exposes you to a higher percentage of creeps on the platform.
As for them not being able to see your gig/profile after being blocked, I don’t know. We’ve yet to hear some creep’s testimony of one of his “favorite” sellers just disappearing. I personally always thought it sounded too good to be true. For instance, you can block a user on the forum so you, in theory, can’t see their posts. Except you can, their every comment gets marked with “hidden reply” or something along those lines in ALL CAPS and you can click it and view it. Which kind of defeats the purpose.
Maybe blocking the site’s user works in a similar way (if at all): you’re supposed to be invisible but you aren’t really.",N/A,"Jul 27, 2020 3:28 pm",2020-07-31 15:35:46.513269

For example, a logo design could be delivered. Then the buyer might ask for a revision as they aren’t happy with the colour. So I would provide a revision correcting the colour and deliver that.
It is normal to offer a few revisions on your gig. But I recommend staying away from unlimited revisions as it could cause you to end up working hours and hours longer than you planned to.",N/A,"Jul 27, 2020 4:08 am",2020-07-31 15:36:27.082932

Fiverr since 2016 and his reviews also are very good
None of this suggests credibility or ethics or that the person would be decent to work with. Lots of sellers review well because they want the buyer to give them more work and, knowing their username is visible with the review on someone’s profile, they want to look agreeable. And lots of sellers tolerate a lot of nonsense because they are desperate for work and have no self-respect.",N/A,"Jul 26, 2020 1:32 pm",2020-07-31 15:36:42.862238

There is no need to give out your number in order to download an Android app. The buyer is most likely a scammer or ignorant as
@humanissocial
also said.
Of course, it is allowed to do the work required in the Android app, but there is no reason to give out his personal contact details, nor is there any reason to communicate outside of Fiverr.

Let me share one incident with you. I was talking with someone on telegram regarding a project. That person wanted me to install an android app so that I can give him feedback about the app’s functionality. I said yes and received the file. I didn’t install that android app immediately on my phone. I installed that android app on an android emulator. The app asked for unnecessary permissions during install. Something seemed fishy. As I am not an android expert, I forward that android app to my friend, who is an android app developer. My friend informed me that the app is malware, which will send my phonebook and SMS, email details to a remote server.

You can edit Google Docs anonymously. If buyers tell me that they need my email address in order for me to edit Google Docs, then I simply tell them to change the “Share” settings, so I do not have to give out my information.
There is still no need for him to give out his number to access an Android app. In my opinion, the buyer is acting suspiciously; hence I advised the OP to be wary earlier on in the thread.

Go to Fiverr and type ‘dating coach’ or ‘I will talk about anything with you online’ and you’ll know what I’m talking about. The point I’m trying to make is that certain venders will use their sexuality for the purpose of luring you in.

They told me I could ask the buyer “in an appropriate way” whether they’ve meant to leave such a review or if it was an accident/a glitch. I didn’t because I didn’t want to get an account strike.
But apparently, technically, CS and ToS are still fine with you asking for a review and discussing a review if you’re being “appropriate” and not asking for a specific number of stars or for a “good” review.
I still wouldn’t do it, though. Mentioning “review” to your buyer in any capacity is playing with fire even if the particular instance is in line with ToS.",N/A,"Apr 30, 2019 5:22 am",2020-07-31 15:38:47.837276

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:16 pm",2020-07-31 15:40:49.646216

Then it would appear that your “friends” don’t know how Fiverr works. Fiverr is a place where you can host your freelance services. YOU are still responsible for marketing and promoting your gigs and services to your target audience. That marketing and promotional work takes place off of Fiverr.

I heared when you leave Fiverr for several days or weeks, your rating might drop if you ignore orders and do stuff like that. And I also heared you can avoid by setting some kinda vacation mode on your account so that people wouldnt order from you during the time you set there. But i couldn’t find any instrustions on this yet. I’m planning on spending a couple of days at the country next week and might be leaving for the whole month next year, so this information would really be essential for me.

I heared when you leave Fiverr for several days or weeks, your rating might drop if you ignore orders and do stuff like that. And I also heared you can avoid by setting some kinda vacation mode on your account so that people wouldnt order from you during the time you set there. But i couldn’t find any instrustions on this yet. I’m planning on spending a couple of days at the country next week and might be leaving for the whole month next year, so this information would really be essential for me.
Thank you very much!

I have a returning seller that is just great and likes my work and wants to order 112 new images from me, 15 is already in order, will be delivered today. Now since I am a fast worker, and I know he will pay, I created in advance all 112 images/designs.
In the Fiverr delivery option, max number of files is 15.
YES, I can put all 112 in a nice RAR ZIP but let’s talk prTactical here.
I want to split his order in to 7-8 orders per 15 files.
Possible issues: my GIG will have one buyer 7 times, that may look funky to some new potential clients, or not, maybe they will think it is great he always returns to me.
I will get 7 orders in the mark * on my GIG, but he will have to leave a review on all? Maybe to ask him not to leave a review, just one (FLAGGGGG WARNING, I know, but after, she is great amazing, bla bla, what is he going to write, and review).
And after he accepts my custom offer, do we need to have exchange of communication on the order page, will Fiverr be about me delivering immediately?
The bottom line is I would like to have 7-8 more orders in my statistics, but?

7 to 8 reviews are great and that too from one buyer it will surely increase your stats. But wouldn’t it be tiring for the buyer to first accept all the offers and then mark them as complete and then reviews…
In my opinion,1 big fancy order is fine

Yes, you are right.
I will split his orders but in a more practical way for me and him. He wants different things in graphic design and I have different GIGs for that so I will split orders into fewer orders but proper GIGs since he is OK with adding images of my work for him in my portfolio.

I want to split his order in to 7-8 orders per 15 files.

I will get 7 orders in the mark * on my GIG, but he will have to leave a review on all? Maybe to ask him not to leave a review, just one (FLAGGGGG WARNING, I know, but after, she is great amazing, bla bla, what is he going to write, and review).

Still I think I’d suggest you doing 1 order with everything included in a zip file. When breaking down your client would be paying more, it could be seen as splitting to get more reviews, telling them to review just one of the orders could get you a warning.
I understand you’ve considered those already, but my advice would be to do only one order",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 1:27 pm",2020-07-31 15:49:33.350334

This is just an error of you not understanding what I am selling. I have 20-40 preset boxes that are black and transparent. The buyer selects what he wants instead of black, but I use black template as samples so it is easier for the client to narrow down what he wants. Originally buyer wanted one design (in place of black) and just 3 different styles, but after receiving samples of the finished product he decided he wants to explore more options.
Think of it as I have a white canvas in different dimensions and I provide the client with the canvas to select for my design. Usually, clients pick only one design and 3-9 styles, but he went all in and wants all styles.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 2:16 pm",2020-07-31 15:49:35.274719

Ok, and this is wrong. I do not sell premade things. Everything is custom made.
Unfortunately, I can not share my GIG PDF info and briefing here since that would be promoting.
humanissocial:
And that’s exactly what you’re doing.
I resent this since you still do not understand what I am selling in this particular order I am talking about in this topic, OBS overlays. The mask is set, the client decides on style and design of it and anything can be modified but I need to have some guidelines, like does he want standard shape, rounded shape, unique shape 1 screen, 2, 3 4 5, how many sources in one screen., etc…
You are confusing blank canvas templates with design templates. It is apples and wrench keys.
All my premade minimum 22 styles (I could not put more since PDF size was over 2 MB) are displayed in my portfolio and if client wants basic package he selects from those but all are unique in design (so please distinguish style from design). I have 50 styles - Black background templates, and client selects what he wants black to be replaced with. AKA Overlay for streams.
humanissocial:
It’s not an error in my understanding.
Yes it is and I am waiting for proper clarification since implying I resell premade design is not going to go down easily since that is something I would never do.
humanissocial:
Creating work before it has been ordered when it may not even be ordered simply isn’t wise.
The client asks me in the middle of the current order can I create all of the styles and I said yes, gave my price and he was happy with the price. We are in different time zones drastically so I wanted to have things ready for him when he comes online and deliver all while he is still available and I am awake.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 2:44 pm",2020-07-31 15:49:36.112580

Exactly. You’re selling templates. You do customize them, but there’s no way you can customize them and deliver them “immediately” after the person orders. That’s why it’s confusing. You still have to do the work, yet you’re acting like you can customize and deliver it within moments of the order, which naturally I won’t believe unless the buyer asks you to do a customization and then you do it before the order is made and then simply attach it to the order once it’s ordered. That’s the only way you could submit this immediately unless you’re a robot.
And for the record a template isn’t custom work. So the fact that you’re calling it that makes it all the more confusing.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 3:34 pm",2020-07-31 15:49:36.508667

I made them in my morning so it is ready for him his morning (my afternoon). I basically did the work all 112 files prior order and payment. But it is a promising buyer I have no reason to suspect, working on big project, and my part is only design for the project. He is aware that I made overlays already before his official order. But it was all made as per his requirements.
And yes, me calling something template for civilian not in design can be confusing, since when people mention template they think online mockup templates and presets.
My “templates” are more in line of canvas sizes. I present client with different canvas sizes and he selects which one and where to draw. If I do not do that we would waste to much time of the order for unnecessary conversation and back-and forward issues.
This way I give them samples for testing. If they find something they like (canvas) I work with that. If they want unique canvas, that is in my premium package.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 3:42 pm",2020-07-31 15:49:36.895204

Fiverr is for commissioned work you complete personalized for each buyer, not resale of products.

(but he either didn’t read it, or forgot about it, or doesn’t like it and wants to hear something else): contact Customer Support, explain the situation to them, and ask them for permission and advice.
Typically, when it comes to the members of the same household, they will allow it (but only if you tell them about it in advance), as long as the each household member offers different services, uses a different email address and a different payment provider, and as long as the household members don’t interact with each other on Fiverr (no buying from each other, no reviewing each other’s work, and so on).
So, ask Customer Support, and do as they say.",N/A,"Mar 11, 2019 12:17 pm",2020-07-31 15:50:15.270974

And about the one account per employee thing forget about it they don’t work out really.i have been there, and now a days competition is so high you cant just sit back and relax by opening an account and gigs with out following quality gig rules and hoping that you are going to get enough order to make this as your profession.
instead what you need to do is if you have more man power you can use it to work on different marketing strategies. Upgrade the gigs content-title,description, images and videos adjust your pricing relatively.
if you and your team mates are new to fiverr be active on the forum ask for help and also help others if you can.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Indian Bank Transfer,"Welcome
Fiverr FAQ",7,39,3,"Jul 23, 2020 2:21 pm","Jul 23, 2020 2:45 pm","Jul 23, 2020 2:56 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/indian-bank-transfer/490069,"prateekbora, surajrenuka, shrutiiiii405",prateekbora,1,"Hello there Indian Fiverrers. I’m a little confused about the Bank transfer payout method. I do not have a PayPal so Bank transfer is the only way I can withdraw money from Fiverr.
Okay, assuming I have earned 20$ through one of my gigs, then Fiverr will take 4$ out of the 20$ as a processing fee. Now, when I try to withdraw the remaining 16 dollars through bank transfer, it tells me it will charge me an extra 3$. So, in the end, I’ll be getting only 13$ out of the 20. Is that right?
Now the reason I made this post was to ask if all the money I earn through my gigs will directly be sent to my Bank account after the 14 day fund clearance time. After 14 days, will I have the option to send the money to my bank account myself or will it be sent directly without me having to do anything? Because if the latter is the case, then I think I’ll be at a huge loss if they charge me 3$ for every 20$ that I earn.
Basically, if I withdraw 125$ (5 transactions of 25$ each), I’ll be charged 20% of the cash (25$) as the processing fee. I’ll have 100$ left with me. Then I’ll be charged 3$ per withdrawal = 15 dollars. So, overall, I’ll be charged a whopping 25+15 = 40$ out of the 125$ I earned, leaving me with 85$ only. That’s a bit insane to me because my gig costs only 5$. It means I’ll have to perform my gig 8 times, just to pay for the charge that Fiverr takes.

If your order is 125 then after charging the 20% you will get 100
And if you withdraw through payoneer you will get 85 but if you use pay pal You will get 95.5

Indian Bank Transfer,"Welcome

I’m a little confused about the Bank transfer payout method. I do not have a PayPal so Bank transfer is the only way I can withdraw money from Fiverr.
Okay, assuming I have earned 20$ through one of my gigs, then Fiverr will take 4$ out of the 20$ as a processing fee. Now, when I try to withdraw the remaining 16 dollars through bank transfer, it tells me it will charge me an extra 3$. So, in the end, I’ll be getting only 13$ out of the 20. Is that right?
Now the reason I made this post was to ask if all the money I earn through my gigs will directly be sent to my Bank account after the 14 day fund clearance time. After 14 days, will I have the option to send the money to my bank account myself or will it be sent directly without me having to do anything? Because if the latter is the case, then I think I’ll be at a huge loss if they charge me 3$ for every 20$ that I earn.
Basically, if I withdraw 125$ (5 transactions of 25$ each), I’ll be charged 20% of the cash (25$) as the processing fee. I’ll have 100$ left with me. Then I’ll be charged 3$ per withdrawal = 15 dollars. So, overall, I’ll be charged a whopping 25+15 = 40$ out of the 125$ I earned, leaving me with 85$ only. That’s a bit insane to me because my gig costs only 5$. It means I’ll have to perform my gig 8 times, just to pay for the charge that Fiverr takes.

then Fiverr will take 4$ out of the 20$ as a processing fee.
This is not processing fees…this is fiverr fess…later fiverr will make $16 available to you…
Now about bank transfer. when you are using Payoneer, they charge $3 per transaction so rather then making 4 different transaction its wise to make 1 transaction of $100 so you end up giving only $3…
so fiverr’s 20% is a different thing , you’ll only get Net amount in your fiverr acount after deduction of 20%, and when you transfer, Payoneer takes $3 out of that. No matter what amount you transferred.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 2:47 pm",2020-07-31 15:51:54.971475

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Withdrawal to Indonesian Bank Account,"Welcome
Fiverr FAQ",0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/withdrawal-to-indonesian-bank-account/391485,N/A,sabinaka,3,"Hello!
For fellow Indonesian fiverr users, please share here for information regarding the withdrawal option that is more beneficial (less fee/percentage cut)
My experience:
withdraw to paypal -> Jenius e-card (visa credit card)
exchange rate from the bank itself (3% higher than paypal)
minus withdrawal fee to visa CC = $5
withdraw to paypal -> BCA or any other bank account
exchange rate 3% lower
no withdrawal fee for a certain minimum amount of withdrawal
But since November, I can’t seem to use the bank’s own exchange rate, and paypal will automatically use their own exchange rate… which is 3% lower
In my experience it is a pretty big cut.
For those who has experienced other method such as:
fiverr revenue card
bank transfer (directly from fiverr --> payoneer --> bank account)
paypal to digibank
Please share your experience here!

A custom offer still counts as buying only one gig even if it is for more work than a normal gig. Thus, the quantity will show as ‘1.’
Also, I really don’t see what the problem is - the seller is still willing to deliver for the agreed price.
If you still want to cancel, here is how:

If the seller delivers less than what was promised, you can go through the Resolution Center, which is described in the link I provided in my previous post (and here: https://buyers.fiverr.com/en/article/resolving-issues-with-an-order).

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here's what you need to know
Your Fiverr Experience
After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me. As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw).

And As I already mentioned you will not lose your money if your account got restricted .You can withdraw those money after clearance.

Verification Annoyances
Report a Bug
Hi Vickie I have been all over the place for quite a while, so I am sorry for not being on the forums more often to help make fun of the Mek Sels. I finally figured out what was wrong with my verification. Apparently the page they send you to after the QR code isn’t the right page, and you have to reopen the page on a browser in order to actually get the buttons functional. I was finally able to verify my ID and post pictures of my ugly mug, lol

Fiverr asked me to verify my identity. That is no problem to me, but the verification site just won’t work. I need to upload my documents, but the site doesn’t do anything. I need to click on a button, but the button is basically dead. I tried for hours, refreshed the site a million times but it is still the same. I already contacted the support, but I didn’t get an answer yet. I got much money on pending clearance and I can’t afford to lose the money I worked for. But I just see no option to upload the documents if the site where I should do that is just dead.
Can anyone help?
Thank you very much.",N/A,1,"May 21, 2019 2:17 pm",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-31 15:53:43.081822

Q. The services that I offer often require me to educate my customers about things. So quick responses or chatting is not enough to explain. Eg. If I need to educate my buyer how to shoot the video or how to set me up in their facebook business manager for these things at least 50% buyers need me to explain like a video tutorial.
So I wanted to know do we have any option on fiverr where I can create a video tutorials and share with clients?
If not then can I create a website of own with tutorial videos and explanations?
Sharing individual youtube videos will not help also as I need 1 place where I can list all the common questions which can be accessed in the form of video tutorials.
Of course I will not mention any contact info on the website. My orders will go through fiverr only.
Please let me know what’s fiverr policies regarding this.",N/A,1,"Jul 20, 2020 9:44 pm",kumartheeditor,0,"Zoom calls will be best if I have a $500 service and provided the client and I both are available at the same time. For simple gigs like mine and global clients this won’t be the best option.
Imagine you had to do a zoom call to answer my query it would have been so difficult.
I actually received a reply from CS. They said I can’t create a website but I can create a blogspot (blogger) account. Well isn’t that the same thing except that website is paid and blogspot is free.
I am waiting for their confirmation and if they reply I will use blogspot.

For your gig, you might want to add more images so that customers can see examples of your work. This is one the main things that customers look at when deciding who to order from. Other than that, I highly recommend not using unlimited revisions. It’s just asking for buyers to take advantage of you. Also you might want to change your profile bio. It currently says “Success is not an option”. Not instilling much confidence in potential buyers.
There are many posts on the forums that you should look through to learn more about fiverr, what to do/avoid, tips and more. Here is a good one to get you started:

Tips for Sellers
If you want more orders, here’s what you need to do: You need to research, understand, and reach out to your target customers. You need to Study, Understand, and Connect. The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need.

@mdesigns_off
Here is my honest review:
Your work is not good enough to compete with other seller.
It’s below standart.
You need to improve your skill first.
First video presentation is very bad too.
Sorry to say this, but with your current skill, you will having hard time getting decent order.
Best of luck.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 2:34 am",2020-07-31 15:56:43.393360

Bases on what i see…, Here is my honest view:
You still need to improve your skill first.
This is a good for newbie, but not as good as professional designer
it doesn’t match with your price.
There are tons of “new logo designer” in fiverr…, and they offer for $5 each ( Just WOW)
Youtube Thumbnail is same…, just $5 each.
and you gigs offer logo and youtube thumbnail?
Better to separate this, one gig for logo, and other for youtube thumbnail
and the second gigs, you need to build a better gig thumbnail too

Every designer have their own strength point.
Some is comfortable with Minimalism, some Vintage,
other comfortable with business theme design, other for feminim, or have strength with layout.
You must know what is your most strength point.
Don’t try to grab all the market at the beginning.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:11 pm",2020-07-31 15:57:49.132730

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you best of luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 4:13 pm",2020-07-31 15:58:24.369821

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:14 pm",2020-07-31 15:58:49.713952

Questions about earnings and UK tax/HMRC,"Welcome
Fiverr FAQ",2,73,4,"Jul 22, 2020 9:15 am","Jul 22, 2020 1:54 pm","Jul 22, 2020 2:27 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/questions-about-earnings-and-uk-tax-hmrc/489320,"lloydsolutions, davidtelfer, mariashtelle1",davidtelfer,2,"I’m wondering if anyone on Fiverr can help answer some questions about how Fiverr profits work in relation to UK taxes and offer some suggestions on what might be the best method of withdrawing my profits.
For some background context, it should go without saying that I’m entirely based in the UK. I’m currently unemployed and on job seekers allowance (JSA), and when I last spoke to them they seemed to suggest that it’s essentially fine for me to keep doing work on Fiverr provided what I earn never amounts to more than my weekly/bi-weekly JSA payments. I’ve had my profile active since December last year but only really started selling services on here in April.
The thing is, as far as I can tell, HMRC has absolutely no idea how much I’ve earned on Fiverr until I withdraw it from my profile. But my worry is, if I pull out all of my profits now, how would HMRC view it? I presume working on Fiverr isn’t classed as self-employment, so I don’t think I’m eligible for the “trading allowance” relief on the first £1,000 of my income.
But the thing is, if I say withdraw all the money I’ve made so far in one lump sum, would HMRC treat that as effectively money I’ve earned just for this month? The amounts I’m talking about certainly don’t come anywhere near to my JSA payments (it’s under £300 over the whole time I’ve been on here), but I know there would be a big difference (well, I think anyway) for tax purposes if it was treated as “all money I earned in July” versus “all money I earned over the last 4 months”.
So what is the best way to do it to make it as easy as possible for tax purposes? Should I be withdrawing it in increments every, say, month or week, below a certain threshold? Or would it not be an issue to just pull it all out in one go? I don’t want to transfer it to Paypal first, as I think if I then transfer to my bank account I’d have to pay Paypal a fee (which I’d rather avoid considering Fiverr already taxes sellers for their services!!!).
It sohuld hopefully go without saying that I’m not going to do anything and then quote someone on here for “advice” if it turns out to be wrong. I just want to get an idea of my options, as I’m sure there must be other UK users on here who have faced similar issues.
edit: just with some additional info, based on some calculations I’ve done I can see that my profits per week/month are drastically different depending on whether I arrange all my sales based on the date the order was placed or the date the money was cleared into my Fiverr account. Based off of this, there are 2 weeks by using the ordered date when I technically earned more than my JSA, versus 4 weeks by using the fund clearance date, which I feel will have a significant impact on how this money is treated by HMRC. Or am I overthinking it entirely?",N/A,1,"Jul 22, 2020 11:30 am",mariashtelle1,2,"davidtelfer:

I didn’t read further than that. And it looks like you are confusing a lot of things.
And freelancing wether it’s working on fiverr or any other platform or even offline clients is considered self employed.
You don’t get “trading allowance” because you are not a trader.
However you don’t have to pay taxes on your first 12500£. And you pay taxes once a year.
But I would advice you to call an accountant. Most of them have 1 hour free consultation",N/A,"Jul 22, 2020 1:54 pm",2020-07-31 15:59:00.899873

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 4:12 pm",2020-07-31 16:00:05.084279

Thankfully Fiverr has fixed the deadline of 72 Hrs. to let the order automatically assumed delivered/ completed keeping in view the interest of sellers. I can see that many of the respondents have suggested not to bother buyer again and again and wait for 72 Hrs. so that the work automatically gets approved by Fiverr. I fully agree with this…Best wishes,N/A,"Jul 22, 2020 5:22 am",2020-07-31 16:00:30.929941

If you mean withdrawing from funds on Fiverr to PayPal, it’s instant.
If you’re talking about how long funds clear from completed orders, If you are Pro or TRS, it’s 7. If not, it’s 14.
If you’re talking about getting money from orders you started and delivered, it depends on when the client allows it to complete, so in practice it can be months or never (if they get it canceled later).",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 1:33 pm",2020-07-31 16:00:48.536107

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:07 pm",2020-07-31 16:01:37.494521

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon!

I’ve been following the advices of the website …to make at least one customer, but nothing. I don’t think the problem is with my skills,without being arrogant …
.so I would like advices on How to irmpove all of it…
-I’m in the character design / illustration field
-I shared on many media about it Facebook,instagram,tumblr
-Seen what the customer wants, and what others do
I’ve seen the gig analytic problem on the forum, but I’m not sure if it’s still the case
(I’ve tried to deconnect and clear my cookies …I’m gonna see with the support if there is a problem really )
update: just got a customer so I don’t know?

You can (many people do), however, other people, with separate accounts, using that same wifi connection might be perceived as the same person with multiple accounts. I recommend that you contact Customer Support, let them know of your situation, and proceed according to what they tell you. You don’t want Fiverr thinking that you have multiple accounts.

@graphics_xpert8

In Bangladesh and some other countries most of users are using shared IP.
Different individual user (Must have individual computer) can use same IP for working on fiverr . It is not problem. Make sense currently you are using shared IP ( May be)
So you and your wife can use same IP.
1.But you can take dedicated IP if you wish. Simple discuss with your ISP. You will get it.
2. If you wish you may take multiple internet connection ( Dedicated or shared IP).
These are not problem. Just need to take a decision that what you want to do. That’s it.",N/A,"Jul 19, 2020 1:33 pm",2020-07-31 16:05:47.913693

What service does your wife want to provide? If it is a different service CS will more than likely approve it as we regular users have seen happen many times here.
However, you worked hard to get your level two account. Do you really want to endanger it by following advice that has been given to you by some of the sellers here?
Just today, this seller posted this. If you want to take a chance with your account do not contact CS.

Why do you not want to merely hire your wife and sell the service under one profile? It seems as if you are spending money needlessly to get a new connection.
You have been here only one year and already have over 208 reviews so you are doing well. Your business can only grow.
Yet it seems you are willing to throw it all away by taking a chance on the poor advice of some. The advice from these people may not be correct.
Plus, these same people are encouraging you to break the TOS as two accounts in one household may NOT sell the same services under two different profiles. It seems as if you and your wife are trying to game the system by having two profiles selling the same service.

I personally can’t say much because:
I received a late notification for the start, so when I did get in, I hopped into the first session, but it was just about to end so they said thanks for watching and turned off their cameras
so I switched to the next session, 5 minutes later they said thanks for watching and turned off their cameras.
Sooo… I went to the next session, which was about work/life balance and it must have been the end of it because for 10 minutes they talked about life as a freelancer with children, though even if I had children I wouldn’t have picked up much from that, then they said thanks for watching and turned off their cameras…
So then I went to the main stage and there was a big discussion going on … … which was just about to end.
Honestly it can’t have just been me but I found it a bit frustrating that most of the events were ending so short after another and I didn’t really get to pick up anything that seemed useful to me, probably missed the good parts.

@lloydsolutions
what you explain I am not agree with that, also little confused.
In case of returning buyer I have seen, lots of buyer come to my inbox and their status is “Return buyer” but they never purchase to me before.
My explaynation is if a buyer purchase before but he is irregular to purchase or comes to purchase GIG after a long time.
I think in that case fiverr tells this buyer as return buyer.

Suddenly I was connected to a public network
Fiverr Site Suggestions
Suddenly I was connected to a public network. And I entered the Fiberr app and left after 5 seconds. Now I want to know, will there be any problem in the future? What if someone else on that network works with the similar gig or creates an account with the similar gig in the future?

I translate books and ebooks on Fiverr, for the last delivery, the FULL ebook appear in the gallery of my gig. I imagine that the buyer would like to sell his new ebook in french, it’s a problem !
Seller cannot remove a delivery from the gallery ? We have to contact the buyer to do it by himself ?
Do we have solution about this ? The seller cannot decide by himself to keep or remove a delivery in his own gallery ?
I need this option !
Have a nice day guys,
Clément",N/A,1,"Apr 30, 2020 5:50 am",j6nyc6,3,You could have avoided this by turning off your live portfolio. However it was the buyer that made the mistake not you. When they complete an order it gives them an option to share their order on your portfolio. I believe its a box they needed to uncheck but didn’t. I do not believe there is anything else you can do. Maybe contact CS to see if they can help/,N/A,"Apr 30, 2020 5:39 am",2020-07-31 16:10:49.174503

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 18, 2020 4:07 pm",2020-07-31 16:13:07.092145

Register items each time you use them
Each time you download an item, you get an ongoing license for a single, specified use. Want to use an item again? No problem! Visit your downloads and simply register it again for a different end use.
Clear guidelines on what’s not allowed
Some common-sense limitations do apply, as set out below:
You can’t re-sell, or re-distribute items;
You can’t use items in on-demand services; and
You generally can’t use items as the basis for merchandising. For example, printing a logo from Envato Elements straight onto a T-shirt is not allowed. See clause 13 below for the relevant terms and conditions.
Future proof licensing, even if you unsubscribe
If you unsubscribe, you can’t use items from Envato Elements any more. But any existing uses that you registered are still covered. Now that’s peace of mind!",N/A,"May 7, 2020 6:14 pm",2020-07-31 16:13:19.499456

A 403 page is an error page that simply states you’re not authorized to access that page. As said above they most likely just want to whitelist your IP, but you could always confirm with them.
That would be the equivalent to someone giving you an address, and asking your name to let their reception know that you’re allowed inside. Once you get there, they will ask your name, check against the list, and if your name is there you’d be authorized entry.

Pretty much every cyber attack these days takes the form of a social engineering attack. First it will be a request for a users IP. Then when a seller provides this information, there will be another request for more sensitive information — or an invite to use TeamViewer, etc.
No one thwarts a social engineering attack by first placing blind trust in a random person online who wants access to any kind of information that they have no reasonable need of.
Nowhere does this seller say that they will work directly on a website for any reason in any of their gigs. If the buyer does need to whitelist an IP, they will also be able to see on their end which recent visits to their site have resulted in visitors being directed to a 403 error page.
This whole situation is fishy and in my opinion, there are already enough red flags to deter most sellers working with this buyer.",N/A,"Jul 19, 2020 6:04 am",2020-07-31 16:13:35.886190

The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need.

Welcome to my post. Here is some tips for you.
Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Welcome to my post. Here is some tips for you.
Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.
Wish you good luck with that
Thank You

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

While I actually agree with your pricing strategy (one photo edited for $5), the problem you’re going to face is that there are sellers offering 10 photos / 50 photos / 100 photos edited for $5. It’s crazy, but search and you’ll find thousands of sellers like this.
So the only way you are going to win is based on quality. However, I’m sorry to say that having just two very ordinary examples in your gallery is very unlikely to result in an order.
You’re not demonstrating variety. You’re going to need at least half a dozen very different photos for that. And to be quite honest, looking at the fairground ride example, it’s very difficult to tell which side is the improvement. The left side is a bit dark but acceptable, whereas the right side is oversaturated and uncomfortably light.
You need to really focus on providing high quality examples and more of them.",N/A,"Jul 17, 2020 4:43 pm",2020-07-31 16:17:13.870203

Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Graphic Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

I had picked up an interest in graphic design at around late 2018, I took up a course for graphic design,
finished it, and didn’t really do much with the talent other than mess around and make designs and keep
them to myself, but recently I have started to make designs for my friends, and slowly I began to realise
my potential.
So it really started when one of my friends said he’d pay me to create a overlay for his twitch stream, and
from there I started doing commissions on Discord servers and so far it’s been going great, and then my

I had picked up an interest in graphic design at around late 2018, I took up a course for graphic design,
finished it, and didn’t really do much with the talent other than mess around and make designs and keep
them to myself, but recently I have started to make designs for my friends, and slowly I began to realise
my potential.
So it really started when one of my friends said he’d pay me to create a overlay for his twitch stream, and
from there I started doing commissions on Discord servers and so far it’s been going great, and then my
sister recommended this site, and here I am now.
I may not be any shining confidence idol, but I’m gaining stream y’know? I’m improving on my graphic
design hobby and I can see how this could potentially become a reliable source of pocket change.
Getting to know the community is my current goal right now, so maybe pop in a reply to this and we can exchange hellos?

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders.

Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Graphic Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do.
Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon!

hussain_jabir:
Can i share my gigs in forums?
If you’re asking if you can share your gigs in other forums, no… that is spam. Don’t do it. Posting spam on forums is likely to get you banned from those forums. If you want to earn more orders, please do not spam anything with your gig links. Customers (or, at least the kind of customers you want) do not buy through spam links.",N/A,"Jul 14, 2020 4:30 pm",2020-07-31 16:22:34.536563

I love fantasy, so I took a peek at your gig, and saw that you already sold a gig and got a great review, so you’re having a really good start!
I noticed that you have the same main image on 2 gigs, it’s better to have unique images for each gig, to present more of your work, and also to prevent buyers getting confused about what they buy (if you’ll have to cancel because a buyer thought they ordered gig 1 but wanted gig 3, it will hurt your rating). Fiverr definitely recommends not using the same gig image in their “Gig Images: Do’s and Don’ts” 2.
I think it’s even not allowed and might get a gig paused or denied, I remember a post by a seller who had to change his images, and those were not even the same image, but just too similar for support’s tastes apparently. The above link leads to the image article in the Seller Help Center, which I definitely would recommend any new seller to read, there’s a lot of valuable info there.
All the best with your gigs, I’ve bookmarked them, just in case I’ll need some fantasy illustrations some fine day, you never know …",N/A,"Jul 16, 2020 2:59 pm",2020-07-31 16:24:26.884437
