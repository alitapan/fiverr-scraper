VOs who have raised/doubled their prices: are y’all getting orders?,"Your Fiverr Experience
My Fiverr Gigs",1,26,3,"Jul 21, 2020 7:42 am","Jul 21, 2020 5:03 pm","Jul 21, 2020 5:03 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/vos-who-have-raised-doubled-their-prices-are-yall-getting-orders/488682,"english_voice, gwyneth_galvin",gwyneth_galvin,3,"I’ve had some really lovely comments/messages over the months from some of you saying that I should raise my prices. I have tried that in the past and my orders dropped out significantly - enough that my increase in prices didn’t make up for the loss in sales.
I’ve been really busy lately (4-5 orders per day) so I decided now would be a good time to try it, as I’ll need a break soon to rest my voice anyway. So I kept my base rate the same but doubled my increment price. I haven’t had any orders in 2 days now and have had quotes rejected twice.
So for those of you who have doubled their prices, how are you maintaining sales? I agree that my work is worth more, but if I’m not getting any orders I can’t pay my dang gas bill.
Oh also, most of my regulars disappeared around March, I’m assuming because their offices closed due to Covid. So I can’t depend on my regulars to get me through. Almost all of my orders in the last 2 months have been from unique sales.",N/A,N/A,N/A,english_voice,0,"As a former Fiverr voiceover, I have to say that one of the reasons I stopped selling voice services is because people generally weren’t prepared to pay what I considered to be the going rate for my time and skills.
A lot of the voiceovers I did (we’re talking between five and seven years ago) were for whiteboard videos which have (thankfully) gone out of favour now. But my point is that while there was a demand for my gig, sadly it was from very low budget productions. The moment I tried to increase my price, sales dropped away.
When you throw into the mix the fact that people often want things re-voiced once or twice (as how you interpreted the intonation of their script wasn’t how they heard it) - and suddenly a 15 minute (allowing for everything) / $10 gig becomes a nightmare.
The Fiverr marketplace is great for selling certain services. I’ll be honest and say I couldn’t make it financially work for me when it came to voiceovers. Maybe I wasn’t quite good enough, but I just attracted the $5 / $10 / $15 type of buyer at the time.
Good luck.",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 5:03 pm",2020-07-21 17:09:35.671143,

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,lenasemenkova,5,"The most dreaded diagnosis in my profession is arthritis (of the wrist mostly) because it’s brushes and pens all day your entire life and you have to rotate and move your hand in strange ways and no one really tells you that you need stretching and exercises until chronic pain comes along.
I try to get my friend to a doctor but he has this “it’s degenerative so what’s the point” attitude about it but even so, you still can slow it down or even fix some of it. More importantly, you you can manage it and I think it helps to get some assurance and power back.
Hugs to you. Take good care of yourself and go to a doctor.
PS It’s embarrassing but I still follow some emo bands I was a fan of when I was young and edgy, and all the vocalists of all of those bands have done multiple surgeries you mention. It appears to be your regular Thursday thing if you scream for a living. Everyone’s doing fine, still recording albums that may be out of touch culturally yet still sound great (screaming-wise).",N/A,"Jun 2, 2020 2:54 pm",2020-07-21 17:11:10.050978,

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,raptargraphix,3,"Raise your prices, take 1 month off the grind and only do a select few jobs if you can afford it. Maybe consult a vocal coach and exercise your vocal chords daily and see if things improve after a month. If nothing changes, schedule an appointment with a good ENT and they’ll def be able to help.
It’s okay to step back and allow your body to heal at times. I went through hell last year and had to rest for 4 months straight (2 weeks bed ridden) but things can always bounce back but make sure you don’t push things so far that it becomes difficult to recover from.

I recently nearly doubled my prices to manage my workload and it’s been working out very well. I’ve had repeat buyers order at the new price with no complaints. I’ve had brand new buyers order no questions asked. I’ve also taken great pleasure in politely excusing tire-kickers who I know can’t afford my services. Less work at higher prices is the way to go.

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,gwyneth_galvin,1,"Hi, wow! This is so kind of you to say. Thank you, I’m really flattered.
I have tried raising my base price - same word count price but double the minimum required to order - and I didn’t get any orders for a week. I did this twice and got scared and switched them back.
Actually, around 50-60% of my work is typically repeat clients, and they never have any complaints about my prices like you said. But since lockdown most of them have disappeared. People I worked with for 3+ years haven’t sent me a message or anything since about March. So I’m very hesitant to raise my prices when almost all my work comes from unique buyers at the moment. It’s a weird position to be in and makes me very anxious about the future. I feel like I’m hanging on by a thread sometimes",N/A,"Jul 17, 2020 3:16 am",2020-07-21 17:11:11.991963,

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,ukbritishvoice,1,"Chin up, Gwyneth. I always like your posts so I am sad to hear this. Something will be the answer. An example: My ex-girlfriend was sick and in pain for two years with a bad back. It was ruining her life (and my life). Visits to State doctors, visits to private doctors, hypnotherapists, you name it. Hundreds of pounds worth of treatments (there are some serious charlatans out there). Crying, depression, rehabilitation centres, the works. She had to lie down or stand when we ate out. Just a horrible time. I had a few feet problems and orthotics in my trainers solved those problems. One day she went to the place where I had my orthotics made and had a very thin wedge, contoured to one of her feet made. It solved the problem. One tiny wedge corrected an imbalance in height between her left leg and right leg that nobody had diagnosed. No more problems, just like that. So, don’t give up, remain positive (which you already seem to be) and be open to the answer, it will come…

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,melissaharlowvo,2,"We don’t think about our physical self affecting our work. I was at my parents house eating dinner and I stuck a fork right into my two front teeth! They both chipped and couldn’t be repaired except crowns! Ughhh I have always had beautiful teeth and teeth health so this was also devastating to me. I agonized over the decision to have this done. So I finally did. That was last year in October and I am still getting used to my front teeth. My F, TH and S sounds along with certain word combinations are challenging. I feel like I have a speech impediment! However, my clients don’t know it just takes longer for me to record and my editing is sometimes very challenging.
So then you add Covid- 19 and I fear going to the dentist to get them dialed in.

Gwyneth x",N/A,N/A,N/A,mayanksusngi,3,"I had a brief look and your gigs are fantastic (bookmarked them for future reference!). I feel what you’re saying about dreading the visit and time off, but I’ve learned the hard way that taking time off to fix things now before they compound is absolutely the best way to go about it, both for your physical and mental health. Otherwise the anxiety piles up and the resentment you feel about yourself and how you expect things to be creates a constant source of dissatisfaction that is maybe what is the source of at least some of the lost motivation! A lot of times I think we feel pressured to always be productive and force our bodies and minds to do things they’re not meant to be doing.

“Just drink some lemon and fennel tea” - yes, I’ve tried this many times
“Just take breaks every 30 minutes” - my voice breaks after 30 seconds

“drink lots of water” - your girl’s pee is clear folks
“don’t strain your voice, stand up straight, breathe from your diaphram…” - yes, yes, yes. I promise, I am.
I have gotten a lot of really great advice but the fact is, there is something WRONG with my voice. I used to be able to record for several hours in one day.

I stuck a fork right into my two front teeth! They both chipped and couldn’t be repaired except crowns!
Ouch that hurt me just reading about it! Our mouths and throats are priceless instruments, and ya can’t just replace a part if it gets worn out! (that’s my deep philosophical moment of the month)
mayanksusngi:
I had a brief look and your gigs are fantastic (bookmarked them for future reference!)
Thank you for the kind words
mayanksusngi:
Otherwise the anxiety piles up and the resentment you feel about yourself and how you expect things to be creates a constant source of dissatisfaction that is maybe what is the source of at least some of the lost motivation!
This is exactly where I was about a month ago. I started therapy recently and it’s helped me get some perspective on my anxiety - that along with taking work at a slower pace has helped me out tremendously.
I think part of the reason I find Fiverr so stressful is because I want so badly to do well and I worry about not reaching my best potential. My husband and I are trying to buy a house and I think about where I want to be in 5 years and I worry about letting myself down by not hustling enough. But, it’s like you said - work can’t be everything. It’s a tough balance. I’m lucky to have the opportunities I have, at the very least.",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 3:30 pm",2020-07-21 17:11:14.430677,

Basics to Improve Your Gig. A helpful breakdown and guide

Introduction – This is not a list on how to make gigs. This is for gigs that are already made that are under-performing, need an overhaul, or just need somewhere to start for self-evaluation/education. It does contain a few general-information bits, and can help during gig creation, but that is neither the focus nor the intent. For more information on any of the following sections or points, please see ‘Other Resources’ under (RRD) at the end of this post. Sections: (TCT) Title, Category, and…

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:15 pm",2020-07-21 17:12:14.548050,

Also, I personally always think it’s annoying when somebody posts his Fiverr-Gig on social media. I actually left quite a few groups because of this. Went there to help people with questions about technical issues and possibly learn something but instead got bombarded with crappy Fiverr-Gigs.

@patrick_klein

Sir, I appreciate your opinion. In another sense, if you think $5 is sufficient so please do the calculation. Even Fiverr deducts 20% per order. please don’t mind. I’m just expressing my personal opinion. If I did any wrong pls advise me for correction.
Point-1. Whereas sellers with 100-400 reviews are offering $5 but I am offering $10.
Ans: Top-rated sellers are getting more orders every week because of their first-page ranking and reviews. So they don’t reach much loss if they offer $5. to be honest, I don’t think these types of jobs worth only $5.While the market is getting competitive day by day. So we new sellers have to walk with the same flow. Otherwise no way. According to your advice, I will change my offer price very soon.
Point-2. It’s annoying when somebody posts his Fiverr-Gig on social media.
Ans: Yes I agree with you. it’s actually annoying. But Fiverr saying “share your Gig on social media to connect with new customers and get more orders”.
There is a proverb-“Marketers have to be shameless a bit” Whatever people think about a marketer if a marketer stops the marketing of his products customers will forget about it.
Since I am not a native English user, If anything seems difficult to understand pls feel free to ask me.
Thank you

Fiverr doesn’t like it when you use someone else’s work. (You 2nd image is watermarked, meaning it’s not yours.) (TOS)
Your gig descriptions need to clearly differentiate what perks are part of which package. (If a buyer is confused and there are other options, they’ll likely go to those other options, rather than take the time to puzzle out what you’re offering.)
Always check your gig thumbnails from your profile. Your images have been cropped. The text size for the first gig’s image would be unreadable at that size if it were visible.

Hence why I only offer factual proofreading services nowadays. After all, there’s no disputing where an apostrophe should be!",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 2:55 pm",2020-07-21 17:12:39.255365,

The number of times I do the work requested and an animator comes back to me and says: ‘My client wants a different voice please cancel’.
Firstly, their client is their responsibility - I’d love it if everybody wanted to use me for all of their projects - but sadly, that’s impossible. My client chose me to do the job I have just delivered - if their client is unhappy, that’s not really for me to worry about if I’ve done everything I can and shouldn’t be expected to cancel.
Secondly, by sending my work to your client (in any form) you have used my work and should pay me for it, regardless if in the future you want to find another voice over. This is not an auditon process.
Thirdly, you’re breaking the Fiverr TOS - you can only use work for any purpose once you have paid for it - not before you have marked the order as complete.
""Voice Over Gigs, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is purchasing basic rights, (which means the Buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for any purpose except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots). "" Payment is only made once the order is marked as complete.

As a video editor, I constantly link clients to different Voice over artist’s gigs or if they’re lazy, they make me do it and I end up hiring people. It hasn’t happened frequently, but when a client hasn’t liked a person’s voice, I actually get another person (usually cheaper) to record it so they have two versions to choose from, at least. This ends up coming out of my own budget at times. Just to add an alternative perspective-As a seller-I have two options-1. Send the audio file of the VO to the client or 2. Directly send them the final video with the VO attached. There’s really no way for me to safely mark an order as completed before using what was delivered. If there are any changes, I obviously pay the VO artist for additional changes, but what I’m saying is that this has less to do with using the files beforehand and more the intent by unscrupulous sellers to cut their own costs. To avoid this sort of a situation, just don’t offer any revisions. I’ve previously had some people use my videos before they accepted the delivery as well and it definitely irked me so I completely understand where you’re coming from, though!",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:06 pm",2020-07-21 17:12:39.647268,

Unbelievable loophole in the process.
Have you contacted the CS? They should take your side in this. Although, I see that you already got 1* review from this animator one hour ago
I am eager to see what will CS say about this. I don’t know how many days you have to give the review back, but if CS dont change anything, don’t forget that you can also leave 1* review for the video guy as well.
mayanksusngi:
As a seller-I have two options-1. Send the audio file of the VO to the client or 2. Directly send them the final video with the VO attached.
No, you have also a third option, make the research for your client and propose him several profiles for him to chose from, by telling him to listen to the samples in the VO artists page, before even contacting the VO artist. That would be fair. What this guy did by saying “PLease cancel, my client has chosen another VO” is just bad, bad way of doing buisness.

THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!",N/A,N/A,N/A,visualstudios,2,"That doesn’t really make sense either. You don’t need to focus on specific reviews, or which countries they come from. The profile and gigs will tell you everything you need to know.
Imagine you go to a profile that has 100 reviews, and 100% of them are from the US. Are you going yo ignore them all?
People buying reviews are meksells. Meksells are obvious in other ways. The country where the reviews come from is almost always irrelevant, specially if it’s a big market like the US. Now, if the seller has a ton of reviews and they all come from like, vatican city, then I would look into it, that is indeed odd.
Having only reviews from major buyer countries is not strange - I actually have most of my reviews from a small group of countries, since I prefer working for them anyway. If I could pick, I’d rather only work for buyers in one or two countries. Better communication, higher prices (on average).

Here is some tips for you. Start with your profile and make It attractive by explaining who you are and what you can do, then go to your gigs and try to offer something you are very good at (e.g Web Design) and put good Images or video that describe what you are good at and what you can do. Now you are ready to make some offers by going to Buyer Requests section, you’ll see some buyers are requesting service related to what you are offering In your gigs, send them a good proposal with good price and short delivery time, then you’ll get some orders soon! Getting your first order as a new seller maybe take time, so have some patience and keep your eyes on Buyer Requests section because It’s the easiest way to get orders. Wish you good luck with that",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:16 pm",2020-07-21 17:13:41.586283,
What to do when a buyer stops responding?,"Your Fiverr Experience

I’m new to Fiverr, just created my account and gigs yesterday. I submitted an offer to a buyer request and received a message with more details from the buyer. I told them I’d love to help and asked a few questions, then once they were all answered and the buyer agreed on the price, I sent a custom offer. I haven’t heard back since and I know it’s only been a day, but they wanted the work done this week so I’m not sure if I should reach out and see if they have any questions or accept that they’ve moved onto someone else.
Is it normal for a buyer to reach out and seem interested but end up going with someone else instead? I don’t want to get my hopes up and I’m not sure if I should even expect another response if they did end up going with another seller. Any advice would be appreciated!

Although I can totally see your logic here, I don’t think this is the case, because the buyer has paid via PayPal and the funds would have left their account. Technically, Fiverr is the one who’s ‘winning’ at the moment, as the funds are sitting in their escrow.
This makes me think that this is probably more a lack of understanding about how to use the system than malice. It doesn’t make any sense for the buyer to leave the order in revision… they gain nothing.
If it were me, I’d just re-submit the work, with a polite but firm message along the lines of “Just re-submitting the work as there are no revisions required… etc”. I wouldn’t ask any questions or get into a conversation about revisions, personally.",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 11:41 am",2020-07-21 17:14:28.135961,

She suggested a longer sample of 150 words and I said perfect that is my basic voice over rate. I created the fully produced sample of 150 words the same day! I normally charge for same day delivery but Knew her client was probably waiting (that’s on me)
A few days went by and she wants a revision but her message said she would show her client. I was thinking, red flag… why is she putting this into revision when there is nothing to revise.
A few days go by and she apologizes for the late response and her client loved my voice but wanted to stay with a male voice. She thanked me and said she hoped we could work together again and then…She clicked REVSION! Wait…what…? Did I miss something? I contacted CS and said I think a buyer has scammed me and Fiverr.
This is a clear attempt and must be practiced often by this person or company. Hey just leave it in the REVISION mode and you don’t have to pay for it!
She was from a large branding, marketing company.
CS agreed that I had given her what she asked for and there was no reason to leave it in revision but wanted me to wait to see if she completes the job. So it’s been about 9 days.
I realize that having an order in revision in perpetuity is better than a cancellation but the idea that it’s a clever way to get free work on Fiverr is just beyond belief.
Here is my immediate reply to her: “Hi ——-, I am just wondering why the order is in Revision. Revisions are for orders that need a change or modification. I am sure you may have clicked the wrong button as Revisions are for projects that need changes. Since your client did not feel a female voice was the direction, there is no Revision needed.
Thank you for reaching out to me as a new buyer since April 2020. I am sure it was an oversite as it appears that you may be new to Fiverr. The next step would be to complete the order so the funds are released according to the Terms of Service.
Since I am a Top Rated Seller my influence on Fiverr is positive from the wonderful buyers to expressing concerns and advice on the Fiverr Forum.
Again, if you do not complete the order, your project (my efforts) will remain in a pending status. I hope this is not your intention as again, I am sure it’s an oversite. If you have questions or concerns about this order, you can certainly reach out to me or customer service (which I have done already)

I am sure you may have clicked the wrong button as Revisions are for projects that need changes. Since your client did not feel a female voice was the direction, there is no Revision needed.
Thank you for reaching out to me as a new buyer since April 2020. I am sure it was an oversite as it appears that you may be new to Fiverr. The next step would be to complete the order so the funds are released according to the Terms of Service.
Since I am a Top Rated Seller my influence on Fiverr is positive from the wonderful buyers to expressing concerns and advice on the Fiverr Forum.
Again, if you do not complete the order, your project (my efforts) will remain in a pending status. I hope this is not your intention as again, I am sure it’s an oversite. If you have questions or concerns about this order, you can certainly reach out to me or customer service (which I have done already)

Yes that’s a good idea. If the person doesn’t revise or complete in 3 days it will be auto completed so it’s a good way to double check if indeed it was intentional.

A few days go by and she apologizes for the late response and her client loved my voice but wanted to stay with a male voice.

CS agreed that I had given her what she asked for and there was no reason to leave it in revision but wanted me to wait to see if she completes the job. So it’s been about 9 days.
I realize that having an order in revision in perpetuity is better than a cancellation but the idea that it’s a clever way to get free work on Fiverr is just beyond belief.
Here is my immediate reply to her: “Hi ——-, I am just wondering why the order is in Revision. Revisions are for orders that need a change or modification. I am sure you may have clicked the wrong button as Revisions are for projects that need changes. Since your client did not feel a female voice was the direction, there is no Revision needed.
Thank you for reaching out to me as a new buyer since April 2020. I am sure it was an oversite as it appears that you may be new to Fiverr. The next step would be to complete the order so the funds are released according to the Terms of Service.
Since I am a Top Rated Seller my influence on Fiverr is positive from the wonderful buyers to expressing concerns and advice on the Fiverr Forum.
Again, if you do not complete the order, your project (my efforts) will remain in a pending status. I hope this is not your intention as again, I am sure it’s an oversite.

Strange. Next time just tell them you don’t do samples
This was a paid sample and auditions are common in voice over. More and more we are requiring some kind of fee because it’s studio and editing time. If I give free samples to everyone who asks I would have no paid time.
I don’t see why people can’t like or not like a voice by hearing it in any context. The idea that you take your time and give people a custom sample is ridiculous. What other industry makes you take your time and talent to just give it away? I think it’s time for the cattle call auditions to stop. That’s why I love Fiverr! Buy it or don’t! It’s so simple for buyers and sellers.
On other platforms, you literally take your time and audition all day and are competing against 50-100 other people for that same project and you may never hear anything! It’s a total waste of time. I made money and won auditions but when you calculate the amount of time you spend, your hourly rate is just ludicrous! To me that doesn’t make much business sense.

What you see when you search Fiverr, is not the same as what someone else sees. Every search, for every user, is different. This is how dynamic search algorithms work. Just because YOU can’t find your gig in a search, doesn’t mean someone else doesn’t see it at the top in their searches.
And
@guymastrion
is correct. You have no idea what kind of impressions your gig is gaining, because we all see “NA” for those metrics on our Analytics page – and Fiverr even posted a clear and hard-to-miss explanation at the top of your Analytics page for why you can’t see any metrics. It’s a bug that is being worked on, and may still take a few weeks to fix.
Don’t worry about where you see your gigs – or don’t see your gigs – in the search results. That’s not what matters here. What matters is how well YOU are working to connect with your target customers, and that includes your own marketing, which, as a business person, you should already be doing.",N/A,"Jun 25, 2020 4:48 pm",2020-07-21 17:14:47.392774,

Just doesnt seem right!,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-21 17:14:48.525378,

First and the foremost important thing to do is check whether you have any buyer requests or not. Bid on buyer requests as much as possible according to your skills.
2nd, Take test and do the courses that Fiverr provides. This will hopefully improve your impressions.
3rd, be active on Fiverr forum to give and take support from the fellow members.
Finally, try to stay active most of the time throughout the day.

Impossible to avoid.
What if you work out of a coffeeshop/co-working space, where everyone shares the same IP? What if some other people there also work on Fiverr and are logged on, something you have no way to even know? What if your neighbour connects to your home wi-fi without your knowledge and also sells on Fiverr?
What then? All banned? Please.
The rule is simple and clear - 1 account per person. That’s it. Each person can have one account. Fiverr enforces this by demanding proof of identity when you create an account.
IP is meaningless, field of work is meaningless, etc. - unless you are doing something shady. If you draw suspicion that you may be running multiple accounts, than that data can be useful.

What if I live in a complex with one internet service for hundreds of people?
What then? All banned? It’s ridiculous.
In any case, multiple accounts are a problem if you are doing shady business. If you do everything correctly (including having only one account), Fiverr won’t even care to check the IP.

If you are running multiple accounts by yourself, there will be other signs, and that’s what they will catch. For instance, you won’t be able to be logged in and relying to people on both at the same time, you’ll have to keep switching.

That is why it is better to contact Fiverr if you have a problem in this area.
There is no rule against coming to the forum (Ranting Pot) to complain about an experience you have had or are having - as long as you are not saying WHO you had this experience with.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

I am in shock.",N/A,7,"Jun 30, 2020 7:37 am",cyaxrex,23,"So, I just spent all afternoon writing official guidance for cryptocurrency users who withdraw funds via Wirecard issued cards. Here’s a snippet:
If you use one of the above cards, you will no longer be able to withdraw funds you deposit to accounts. Neither will you be able to use cards online or in-store to make purchases. Don’t worry just yet, though. Any funds on cards you can’t use are safe.
When Will I Be Able to Access My Funds?
How your crypto debit card provider will help you retrieve access to lost funds will depend on their terms and conditions. However, in the case of Crypto.com 2, all users of Crypto.com 2 debit cards will receive 100% of lost funds in the form of credit paid to their existing cryptocurrency wallets in the next 48-hours.
And yet I find out from a random person on the Internet that my own card is affected by this and Lord knows what will happen with my own money.
To me, this will be a test of Fiverr’s integrity. If other companies are able to guarantee that 100% of user funds will be returned in 48-hours, Fiverr should be able to do the same with our earnings.
That they and Payoneer have let this go on for over 24-hours and not even notified users is the equivalent of a customer service kick in the nuts. Quite Frankly, I’m disgusted.",N/A,"Jun 26, 2020 1:37 pm",2020-07-21 17:19:10.537297,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.

If Payoneer decided to freeze all funds on their end, and will just switch the cards or transfer us on a new banking institution or whatever, then the only real issue is that they haven’t sent us a proper email letting us know.

I am in shock.",N/A,7,"Jun 30, 2020 7:37 am",cyaxrex,0,"Well, now I just have more questions.
Firstly, anyone with a USD payoneer card should not be affected by this at all. If you look at the receiving account storing funds, it belongs to a U.S. bank called the Community Federal Savings Bank.
I do have a Euro Payoneer Card that says funds are held with Wirecard AG. However, I have no balance on that, thankfully.
Now, I happen to know from past crypto work that Skrill also stores funds with the Community Federal Savings Bank, yet they don’t seem to be experiencing any service outages due to the Wirecard fiasco.
As I see it, Payoneer funds stored with the U.S. Community Federal Savings Bank should be accessible as usual. According to Payonerr, so too should funds on Euro cards:
We currently work with Wirecard Bank AG in Germany as the provider for the EUR receiving account. Wirecard Bank AG, a regulated subsidiary of Wirecard AG, is a fully licensed bank overseen by the German supervisor BaFin. Wirecard Bank AG has been specifically excluded from the Wirecard AG bankruptcy proceedings
One idea I had was to try and transfer my USD balance to my Euro card, since Payoneer says this should be A-Okay to use. However, I just get an error message saying that I can’t transfer one currency to the same currency:
So whatever is going on just doesn’t make any sense. The U.S. Community Federal Savings Bank doesn’t seem to have any relation to Wirecard and Payoneerr itself says that Wirecard AG isn’t exposed to Wirecard either.
This is all very confusing.",N/A,"Jun 26, 2020 4:49 pm",2020-07-21 17:19:33.845800,

Payoneer to local bank withdrawal went OK as well. Since it’s a weekend, I’m not sure if I will get the money earlier than Monday, but if they face some issues, I will get all the money back to Payoneer account (had the issue once). I will keep you updated about the situation.
P.S. the reason why I decided to do this is simple: I got my Payoneer to local bank withdrawal today, at noon. Withdrawal was confirmed in the morning and everything went nice and smooth. My main balance is USD, at First Century Bank.",N/A,"Jun 26, 2020 4:59 pm",2020-07-21 17:19:34.972289,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I already have the bleakest possible outlook for the economy in 2019. I’m talking so bleak that this time next month I was planning to be in Sicily or Sardinia where things like food self-sufficiency are still a thing. As it is, the first financial domino to fall has been the one most closest to home.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.

Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

What does this mean?
The FCA has communicated that they have taken these measures with the primary objective of protecting the interests and money of consumers who use Wirecard. Pending further actions from the FCA, you will temporarily be unable to withdraw the funds on your card, nor receive new payments onto your card.
Any funds that are in excess of the maximum balance of your card are held by Payoneer and are therefore not impacted by the FCA’s temporary freeze.

I’m not sure what other company does what Payoneer does in the scope of all the countries it’s in.
Payoneer doesn’t do anything. What is revealed by this whole situation is that:
Payoneer doesn’t store your funds.
Payoneer doesn’t process transactions
Payoneer doesn’t issue prepaid debit cards
All Payoneer is, is a middle man brand that presents itself as doing all of the above, that really outsources everything to the cheapest service vendor. As such;
You can trust Payoneer to ignore 2-years of damning investagative reports into Wirecard and still throw your money at them.
You can trust that Payoneer will charge you higher fees than other companies doing the same thing, even though it uses the same payment processors.
You can rely on Payoneer to tell you everything is fine while the house is burning down, while updating their TOS to cover their own behind.
You can trust that while other payment providers linked to Wirecard like Revolut, will tell you what is going on and find a new payment processor in 24-hours, Payoneer will keep you hanging for as long as possible.
miiila:
I think Skrill (formerly MoneyBookers) is still in the market,
Skrill is still up and running. Also, my Wirex crypto debit card is still up and running, and apparently Revolut cards still work, despite them possibly having exposure to Wirecard.
As Skrill is already widely used on other freelance platforms, I hope Fiverr is actively looking into adding support here.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

You say you have a lot of money when you don’t, to get other people to give you theirs. Then when people ask for their money back or just some of it, you give them some of the money given to you by someone else. It is only a matter of time before too many people want their money at once. Then the whole scheme comes crashing down, as it is revealed you have a lot less than you said you did.

Why is this Fiverr’s problem to solve?
Nothing ever is Fiverr’s problem to solve or even notify users about. That’s their problem.
Very few sellers use the forum. There will doubtless have been many people yesterday and there probably still are many people today, withdrawing their money to Payoneer, not realizing that they may not be able to access it when it arrives.
Whenever it has the opportunity,. Fiver loves to virtue signal itself to the extent that if you follow Fiverr on Twitter, you’d think it could walk on water and poop rainbows. Raising breast cancer awareness, being a champion for LGBT rights, celebrating inclusivity and women in the workplace, etc, etc.
However, when it comes the raw basics of being a freelancer like payment processing chaos, Fiverr can’t even be bothered to pin a post about major issues to its forum, let alone send out an email informing its users of disruption.",N/A,"Jun 27, 2020 3:28 pm",2020-07-21 17:21:50.452916,

i am reading on fiverr forum that alot of users are worried for new withdrawal & not going to take risk for new payments withdraw.
Finally i taken a risk withdrawing new Funds from fiverr to payoneer. ( though i also got an email from payoneer that my card is blocked as it was issued by wirecard.) Fortunately i have only $2.31 on that & rest i have all moved to pakistani bank last day.
Btw. after new funds. your balance will split into 2 parts as shown below
So guys ! i taken a step to withdraw from payoneer! it shown on payoneer in 3-4 minutes & i choosen to load “Urgent for $3.00” . but unexpectedly after few minutes the fund was showing on my main balance.
After this i tried to withdraw to bank account but it started giving this error
then my balance got disappeared & the fiverr transaction again gone to “pending transaction” as it seem some glitch. After around 3-4 hours still it was pending. but then i installed payoneer app on my mobile & tried withdraw from mobile & it was showing full balance & new funds withdrawn successfully. but if i was trying to withdraw + $2.31 (old funds) it was showing the error of not enough funds.
Though its a glitch on payoneer dashboard that the transaction is still showing pending. & from website i can’t be able to withdraw funds but after withdraw from mobile app. the transaction still showing pending on website till now even that funds are already in my bank account few hours ago
glitch
1270×546 56.7 KB
So only the current funds are blocked & fresh funds are allowed for withdrawal. Hope so many users will find my story helpful.
We pray that payoneer solve this issue as we have no other way to withdraw money in pakistan.

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

If wirecard bank is A-OK but my funds are frozen, maybe my funds were controlled by Wirecard and not wirecard bank?!?
I think the point is that funds could possibly be on the dark side of the moon for all we know. (Where they are seems to be something no one wants to say for certain.) However, the UK has frozen all funds until Wirecard Card Solutions Limited can give the UK Financial Conduct Authority an assurance that funds are safe and will not be affected by whatever happens with other Wirecard entities.
I, therefore imagine that this might blow over (for now) if Wirecard Card Soilutions Limited can do something like the following:
Prove cash exists.
Prove that funds can not be confiscated by Wirecard creditors.
Prove that it can continue to perform normal business operations.
IF the above criteria can be satisfied, I imagine that this might be resolved quickly given that Wirecard itself is resuming operations.
However, I think there is an issue with the fact that people like myself still have funds going to Payoneer that are being credited to card accounts and not showing as available for bank withdrawal. This is because the UK FCA freeze prevents WCSL from performing any licensed activity while the freeze is in place.
Processing incoming transactions would constitute a licensed financial activity, at least that’s how I see it.",N/A,"Jun 27, 2020 3:52 pm",2020-07-21 17:21:54.893419,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

Paypal has it’s own credit card. I’m not sure if it’s a debit card or not.
I only know about the PayPal business card, as I have a business account, I don’t think they offer cards for private accounts, and that’s a debit card = not a credit card, with 0.5% cashback. However, anyone who is considering it, make sure you read the terms … it says you can only use it for business expenses … bit weird, but well

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.

Fiverr Staff",15,"Update from Payoneer:
We understand that the developing situation with Wirecard has created a lot of concern and challenges for Payoneer Prepaid Mastercard® card users. We have been assured by the FCA that the freeze was put in place to ensure the protection of all cardholders’ funds. We have also been given repeated reassurances that all funds are properly safeguarded. Progress is being made to lift the freeze, and we will continue to update you as soon as more information is available. This situation has impacted the customers of many companies, and we believe that it will be resolved soon.
In the meantime, incoming funds to Payoneer users can be withdrawn to bank accounts or held in a Payoneer Account which remains safe and secure. All funds held in Payoneer are fully liquid and available and held in global leading banks. Our company is strong and stable, and committed to safeguarding our customers’ funds in accordance with all relevant global regulations.
We know that our customers depend on these funds, and that this freeze has created hardships for many people. We have enabled alternative solutions for payment withdrawal and are working to address any technical issues that have come up, and to help our customers in any way we can.
Fiverr is in close contact with Payoneer until this issue is resolved. Will post updates here if there are any developments. For now, I’ll keep this topic open to discuss issues, but please keep the conversation on topic.",N/A,"Jun 28, 2020 1:16 am",2020-07-21 17:22:17.701709,

Around 32:00 here he says that funds over the card limit are still inaccessible for some people because they are “attached to the product” (the prepaid card). I don’t know if it also affects the ability to transfer to the bank (and I would rather not check at the moment).
BUT I feel like they could add a line or two to their emails and blog posts that the solutions they’re currently promoting will not work for certain accounts.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.

Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

To me, it is obvious that Wireard should have had way more than 300,000 users.

Yes, there are millions of their users affected this time and they must be secure our money (which is being frozen) and return it back to us as soon as possible. In case, if they do not return our money then how people can trust a company anymore who could not even secure their users’ hard-earned money!

Withdrawing new funds to your bank account via Payoneer still works.
Your card’s funds are frozen and if you withdraw funds to your card it’s instead added to your Payoneer’s account balance.
You can only withdraw said balance if you link a bank account.

I was informed on a local forum that every freelancer should withdraw their money a week ago.
I wish I had gotten that tip. Why didn’t you act on it? Just curious.

It’s best to keep this thread clean, or keep another thread about Payoneer clean in which you will officially post updates and keep it clean.
I think that will keep happening no matter how many threads we open. A lot of speculation going on by most of us, plus everyone is in panic mode.

Following last week’s news of €1.9 billion missing from the accounts of the German company, Wirecard, we placed requirements on the firm’s UK business so that it should stop carrying out regulated activities and not pay out or reduce any money it holds. Our primary objective all along has been to protect the interests and money of consumers who use Wirecard.
Teams from across the FCA have been working with the firm, and other international and UK authorities, over the weekend, and we have seen good progress by the firm in meeting the conditions we set.
We are maintaining pressure on the firm to resolve these issues which would allow it to operate under certain conditions. However, we cannot lift the restrictions without reassuring ourselves that the firm has been able to satisfy all our concerns for example that all clients’ money is safe. We hope to be able to issue an update soon.

To be honest, I am too. Today is one of those days where I have orders to do that take far more time than they should because of unworkable requirements and buyers who have no idea how to communicate.
My logical brain says I should cancel these and spend my time instead working on promoting myself on other platforms. As it is, though, I’ve decided to push through until Wednesday or Friday. If there is noi resolution by then, I’ll start making my great migration.
I base this on Payoneer playing heavily on the idea that my frozen funds in Payoneer are safe and that this problem will be remedied quickly. If it gets to Friday and there is still no solution available, I’ll consider this nothing more than PR hogwash and move on.

I get that the direct bank transfer seems to be working fine FOR NOW. However, we still don’t know how all of this will affect Payoneer in the future and I’m not exactly itching to go anywhere near the payment options that are still facilitated by it. What I’ve heard from them so far is PR speak and it’s never as reassuring as they hope it to be.
I personally turned on a vacation mode for a few days. I wasn’t planning to but two buyers I had over the weekend chose to be difficult at this worst possible moment and while I’ve dealt and still am dealing with them, I’m not exactly in the mood for any more difficulties if they are to come.
I’m still in talks and accept orders from my regulars and new people who contacted me before all of this went down so my profile is still active and going. So I probably wouldn’t advise on going completely dark.

Thanks for your reply.
I tried to find alternatives this whole weekend. I couldn’t sleep and the hard part? I figured, there’s no option but to wait. We’re stuck. Specially the sellers from Pakistan and South Asian countries (as far as I know).
frank_d:
Have you looked at alternatives? You can still withdraw to a bank via Payoneer, can’t you do that?
Honestly, I do not want to risk my remaining balance by withdrawing through Payoneer at the moment. The option to local bank transfer is directly linked to Payoneer. I will wait few more days before trying it.

I’m still in talks and accept orders from my regulars and new people who contacted me before all of this went down so my profile is still active and going.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.
I am in shock.",N/A,7,"Jun 30, 2020 7:37 am",misscrystal,0,"I read that some people are able to withdraw the money on their cards, One person reported he transferred $2000 from his card to his bank and thinks they are rolling it out slowly but not sure if this is true, given the freeze.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.

Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

Furthermore, from Monday 6 July, cardholders will once again be able to withdraw their funds to their local bank account.
All future payments that you send will continue to be received to your payees’ Payoneer currency balance. There is NO effect on your regular disbursements to your payees.

The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

I am in shock.",N/A,7,"Jun 30, 2020 7:37 am",misscrystal,2,"Will I be able to access the funds on my card?
Yes, you’ll be able to withdraw the funds on your card from an ATM or spend them online and in-store . While you may wish to quickly withdraw your funds, the FCA has assured us that no further problems are expected.
From 00:01 CET on Monday, July 6th , you will once again be able to withdraw your funds to your local bank account and use the Make a Payment and Manage Currencies services . Until then, we will waive ATM withdrawal fees.
Will I be able to receive new funds to my card?
All future payments will continue to be received to your Payoneer currency balance, not your card . Even though the FCA announced that the cards are safe to use, we will offer a new card issuer soon to ensure the long-term safety of your earnings.

FFS! This was the first thing I asked to get clarified yesterday because of this word salad:
All future payments that you send will continue to be received to your payees’ Payoneer currency balance. There is NO effect on your regular disbursements to your payees. You can continue submitting payments via our API and our admin console regularly. These funds are available to your payees to be withdrawn to their local bank account or to be used with any of our other services.

Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.

Wirecard never realized the top executive at Wirecard was falsely telling everyone they had 2 billion dollars they never had. No one bothered to check that out
They actually had audited accounts by EY (Earnst Young) who are one of the the biggest auditors around. They signed off on all accounts until 2018. The Financial Times investigated and found that many transactions were being passed through shell companies with no actual employees so they investigated further. EY finally refused to sign off last year (maybe even reported it) and that’s when the investigation by law enforcement was triggered.
It seems that the 2bn in question was listed as being in a bank that had never dealt with Wirecard. EY never checked with that bank before. EY is also being investigated as a result of this. If they are found to have been negligent or anything worse, then there’s going to be a lot of companies being readudited. Being one of the (if not the) biggest auditors, this could be a story that runs and runs (not affecting Payoneer, they seem to have dealt with things well).",N/A,"Jun 30, 2020 7:59 am",2020-07-21 17:23:41.200010,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

If I may, why do you detest withdrawing to your bank account?
For me, it’s not possible. My bank is in the UK and I live in Malta. The last time I tried to add my bank, I was told it needed to be one where I live (a Malta bank, not a bank abroad.)
I have the same problem with PayPal. I opened my account in New Zealand and can only deposit funds to a NZ bank account which I have but haven’t used for years. Temporarily, I used PayPal in Europe when I lived in Hungary (via a new account). However, with that too, I can only withdraw money to a Hungarian bank.
To withdraw to a bank now, I will have to open a new account in Malta which is difficult as they want to see an employment contract and proof of earnings. Last time I gave up trying.
The only reason I use Payoneer is because I like the convenience of it and the fact that I don’t have to go through the process of opening new bank accounts and PayPal accounts every time I move. I just go to where I want to be and it works.",N/A,"Jun 30, 2020 1:15 pm",2020-07-21 17:23:50.453169,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.

I agree. This post helped a lot. ! Thanks a lot everyone!

Ok, so the issue now is that only the money that was frozen can be taken out of ATMs. Any new funds after the freeze cannot be taken out of ATM machines or used online with the card. So, basically, this is the same issue for those who don’t have bank transfer options. I do have the option, but I prefer the convenience of the card.
I got to know about this last night. It’s still an issue to be resolved for those who don’t have a local bank account and are dependent on the card. Specially in this Covid-19 situation. Suppose, Payoneer is going to send new cards, there will be huge delays due to current pandemic. My local shipments are taking 2 - 3 weeks on average. The new cards will take way longer to reach. I wish the best for anyone facing this problem.",N/A,"Jul 1, 2020 5:40 am",2020-07-21 17:23:55.942054,

Meaning any new funds will have to be extracted via bank account. Until Payoneer finds a new card issuer.
It’s not the most convenient way because it involves a lot of additional movements. Their card was useful in many ways. I could just withdraw the required amount, pay taxes and forget about it.
Payoneer cards were banned in Russia because Payoneer refused to register with local tax authorities (at the same time, PayPal managed to register in a proper way).
Here are the main problems I faced since May:
It’s impossible to get your money during long holidays and weekends.
The largest state bank rejects Payoneer payments because they use strange payment descriptions, which trigger security systems. The largest private bank does the same.
Payoneer customer support has no idea about the process of money withdrawal. When you ask them about the information provided to the bank, they say: “It’s only your name.” When I showed them screenshots below, they were like: “Well, maybe it’s not your name. We have a lot of partners, so there’s no way to know it.”
In fact, it says the following:

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”

Paypal’s debit card
They don’t offer it here. It was available a couple of years ago, but they closed all cards here.
When you transfer USD to PayPal, you lose around 5% on exchange rate. There’s no way to use USD, so I have to exchange it.
In addition, they take 3-4% per withdrawal. So, I lose around 8-9%, which is a lot.
They have only one advantage: They are registered with tax authorities, and I can be sure that my funds won’t be held by the foreign exchange control.
In the case of Payoneer, I have to talk with the bank representatives once in a while, and I never know if my payment is processed immediately or in a week.
At the same time, I hope they will find a solution to offer debit cards here.",N/A,"Jul 1, 2020 12:55 pm",2020-07-21 17:24:01.917473,

I had my card rejected several times this morning, which of course prompted me to communicate with Payoneer CS.
Their response was that all funds are frozen temporarily by the FCA, the regulator in UK.
The reason being that Wirecard AG (Germany) filed for insolvency.
I had a lot of money in my account, it’s what I use to pay my bills and family’s expenses.
Payoneer is “working on sending out an email to all cardholders.”
Until we learn more about this situation, please avoid sending cleared revenue to your Payoneer cards and do not use the “bank transfer” option either, as that one is being facilitated by Payoneer as well.
I am in shock.",N/A,7,"Jun 30, 2020 7:37 am",lenasemenkova,2,"I don’t think it’s an error on the ATM’s side. I’ve seen multiple reports about the cards working in some places but not the others.
I no longer feel safe using it at all in the physical world, honestly. At least not for the time being. Not sure if it’s a temporary thing or if after imposing such a freeze they can’t figure out how or are unable to lift it completely.
PS According to the facebook group, support is saying that “the system is overload” and they are working hard to fix it. It makes sense, I suppose. Both times my card was declined after things got fixed, I got the same unique error message I did when the funds were frozen. It’s like it randomly reverts to being frozen when it feels like it for now.",N/A,"Jul 3, 2020 2:11 am",2020-07-21 17:24:06.596232,

As a result, the card is sometimes working, and sometimes it isn’t.

I’m currently trying to gain some traction on my page by offering professional quality music for a variety of uses at very low prices. Once I gain some more orders I do intend on raising the rates, but if you’re looking for any type of music while I still have prices so low definitely contact me!
Just for some credit, I’ve playing professionally for about 8 years now and currently have three gigging bands. I also start at the Berklee College of Music this fall to further my skills.
Lets get things done together!
Much love,

Some months ago a buyer said that liked of my work, but in the end he start to open a lot of revisions and after that tried to cancel. So i delivered again and just said to him like:
“You can’t cancel based on quality, as you said before, you liked the project… when you use the Fiverr Plataform you agrre with the Terms of Use”
THE MAIN TOPICS to help you:
Requesting to gain more services from Sellers beyond the agreed requirements by using the Request Revisions button is not allowed.
Orders are not eligible to be cancelled based on the quality of service/materials delivered by the Seller if the service was rendered as described in the Gig Page. Buyers may rate their experience with the Seller on the Order Page, including the overall level of service quality received.
Buyers who abuse the Request Revisions button to gain more services from Sellers beyond the agreed requirements.
Buyers who threaten to leave a damaging review to gain more services from the Seller not related to the agreed requirements.
I hope that this can help you, if your buyer doesn’t accept your work you can send again the material and wait for the automatically close after 3 days. If the buyer accept and give you a bad review, you can contact the support and explain and the Fiverr will remove the bad review, as the buyer infringe the Terms of Use.",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 10:47 am",2020-07-21 17:24:32.380725,

Regular",8,"Hey
@juliapla
I’m so sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough situation with your buyer.
It’s always frustrating having to deal with this sort of thing.
If you want my advice, you shouldn’t antagonize them by simply pasting ToS and giving them a dead-end.
It’s also important to not pass blame to them, by telling them it’s their fault. Even if it is.
ToS are open to interpretation and CS will most likely instruct you to figure it out and find a solution by talking to your buyer.
You have a very limited set of moves here from my POV.
You need to stand your ground and make sure it is clearly communicated that you did as agreed upon and that they signed off on every step of the process. Be polite and compassionate. Your buyer could be someone who meant well but never thought things all the way through. It’s possibly the first time they did this.
That being said, you also need to offer a solution.
Do not present them with an ultimatum. But you need to lead the conversation, don’t be passive.
Offer them a do-over, make sure you explain why this is a do-over and not a revision.
Offer a discounted rate and ask for more time if you need it.
In all probability your buyer is a reasonable human being who now needs to face the music on their end: risk losing their client or pay out of pocket to fix things.",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 2:00 pm",2020-07-21 17:24:34.635936,

Regular",4,"I missed that part of the story to be honest.
OK so it seems like there is a pattern here and your buyer most likely knows that they can get their way since it worked last time.
So now you have an even more limited set of moves.
You need to either refund them or be OK with whatever review they will leave you after the order is accepted.
Having customer support involved will only complicate things, as they are tasked with resolving things as quickly as possible.
If both of you opened a ticket then CS will either get confused, will make a snap judgement or side with the buyer to keep the money rolling.
Even if they agree with you, best case scenario is that they will tell you to keep delivering and won’t cancel it for you.
So you need an out and at the same time, you want to do some damage control.
Is the line of communication still open and is the buyer friendly?",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 2:17 pm",2020-07-21 17:24:36.427192,

Regular",8,"OK seems like you have antagonized him enough, he appears to be confident in his decision to call in CS and have them cancel the order.
Looks like you don’t have any moves to make but that’s OK since you are only interested in getting your money.
All you can do is wait for CS to respond to your ticket, hopefully sooner than they get to his.
You could also keep delivering the files -do not deliver without the files uploaded- and with the same message of “here are the files you signed off on. I am available to discuss a fair rate for the re-do your client requested “.
Do not fight with them. And only re-deliver once a day. Don’t spam the order page.
Also when talking to CS, don’t add to the overall frustration.
Let them know honestly that you did what your buyer asked for and delivered as advertised .
Don’t assign blame or escalate things on your end.
This will play out soon enough.

As long as you delivered and he has requested an official revision, in other words the orders is tagged as a revision the order will be marked completed in 3 days anyway, might as well just wait it out.

Reiterate the custom offer’s terms. Attach the screenshots.
Remind the person that I was hired and was working with them, not their “client”, their band bassist’s girlfriend, their secretary who went to the art school in her youth and has an opinion (I don’t include the second half of the sentence, of course).
Remind them that they’ve approved everything (with screenshots).
Offer them a new design at a discounted price while being very nonchalant about it. Things happen, I’ll make a new one, no problem. As long as I’m paid for my time. This is an important step even if they decline. It shows that you’re willing to fix things and are doing your best to cooperate.

To be honest when that happens it makes me furious and no way I’m going to cancel the order as it was not my responsibility to manage a client in this case.
On the contrary I send them a gig extra.
As soon as I know that they didn’t tell me that they are a third party and reselling my services I’m immediately sending them gig extra for x$ for commercial rights. They didn’t have a right to resell my service without my approval and to resell it they need to purchase commercial rights otherwise they are in the breach of TOS.

I offer On-page SEO services on fiverr and I need website’s dashboard access to complete my work.
One of my clients placed a $60 order on 6th July but didn’t submit the requirements. I sent him more than 4 reminders to submit them but he didn’t respond even after being online the whole time.
He then submitted the information on 14th July and the clock started ticking. Now the website on which I need to work is not accessible and it is showing 404 error (Not my fault, either seller didn’t pay the hosting fees or there is an issue from his hosting side). He is not responding to any of my messages from the last 5 days and it already 1 day past the due date.
I did send him the extension request but he is not responding to it as well. Now the order is “Too Late” (1 day). I did contact the CS and I got an automated response that it can take them up to 10 days to respond to my query
Should I open a new dispute for cancellation after withdrawing the extension request?
Or Keep the order in late status?
If I cancel the order (after being late for no fault of mine), will the fiverr system automatically leave the 1* review “Order Cancelled, the seller failed to deliver on time”.
Please help me through this.
Thanks.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-21 17:25:49.592741,

Therefore, when 10 sellers like you, who are level 0, apply for a job Fiver pulls that BR from view. So, if you were typing up your offer the BR could disappear in the middle of your typing. I had this happen to me many times when I first started out. It was frustrating!

said, when you get to Level 1, you will see hundreds of buyer requests.

1- Buyer Requests are Actually worked as a filtered category.

4- Try to be online atleast 8 hours a day.
When I started selling, I just set a single gig with the category “Other” and I was able to see BR. Because sometimes buyers don’t know about the category type of their project so they select “Other”.

I have been on Fiverr for more than 5 years, I am really worried because from the “BUG of GIG views” I have not received any messages or orders. It is very difficult to know if Fiverr is doing its job of exposing our Gigs because there is no way to see the numbers. I have seen in this forum people who assure that we should lower prices and make special offers to receive offers from new clients, however I want to know if anyone knows what is happening in Fiverr? When are you planning to solve…

Hi, I am a graphic designer and a Fiverr seller. And some of you may agree with me about this topic.
I thought the whole point of tipping money or tips from a customer is the personal extra bonus earning that you get from a customer and it’s completely different revenue from the business you are working with.
From the title, it explains everything about my problem, and please explain if someone knows about this or having the same issue as I, can voice it out together on how exactly is the Fiverr’s agreement/policy and such.

As a seller it can feel like a kick in the teeth (as Fiverr has already had their revenue from the order, so why take more money from my personal reward for a job well done?).
On the other hand I can understand how some buyers and sellers would try and arrange deals between them (I’ll place a $5 order but give you a $60 tip… that way as the buyer I pay less, and as the seller you receive more).
It’s just the way that Fiverr is. I think the system is fairly transparent. Fiverr takes 20 percent of all money paid to sellers.",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 4:14 am",2020-07-21 17:26:37.149946,

I disagree.
Honest people won’t do this.
If 2 dishonest people do this, then they deserve each other. The dishonest buyer pays $5, accepts order, then leaves without tipping. The dishonest seller is out of money.

I imagine going to a restaurant, and upon learning that management dips into the staff’s tipping jar, being told they do this cause otherwise staff would just undercharge patrons in order to receive the exceeding amount in the form of gratuity.
Yes, it’s a big market and some people would most likely do that, some of them would get scammed out of their money (karma working at its finest) and some would get away with it. Truth is it would be really easy to find a pattern and punish those doing that.
But, as a business owner, if someone were to tell me: Do you want to spend more money in order to make less money? I’d probably have the same posture as Fiverr does tbh, which is why I understand why they do it, but I think we need to stop making it sound like they have no choice cause most users would just jump in the first opportunity to scam the system in place in order to make a an extra 20% on what most likely would be a symbolic value to begin with.
Primarily working as a WordPress Developer I’d say I had access to over 90% of all my buyer’s emails. How many emails have I sent them? How many buyers have I tried to take away of the platform? And believe me when I say I’ve had more than a few legit buyers proposing it to me.

I thought maybe there could have been some confusion in their gig title and that when this was pointed out to them maybe they would realize their mistake and change it, but they’ve doubled-down and denied that it’s text-to-speech so I’m not sure it’s even worth reporting them, I can’t see anybody listening to those samples and being tempted to make a purchase.",N/A,"Jul 19, 2020 7:09 am",2020-07-21 17:29:15.794690,

I just don’t understand why anyone would pay money for this
I agree there is higher quality text to speech software but they seem more expensive and maybe it would be too expensive for the OP/not profitable enough. eg. the Synthesys software costs $497 to be able to record an unlimited amount of text. I think the Pro version (to change pronunciation of words) costs $67 extra. So at the price the OP is charging, including commercial use, around 70 purchases would be needed just to break even if that software was used (assuming they were all the default number of words). I suppose a cheaper (limited number of characters/words) option could be used if they went with similar software.
So maybe some people would buy it (assuming they were satisfied with the quality - which some may not be) just because they don’t know how to record the text to speech themselves (or maybe there are rights issues with doing that for what they want it for) or maybe they think it’s simpler for the OP to do it and because for the amount of words they need+commercial use it’s cheaper than most/all real voice overs (though if they wanted less words or didn’t need commercial use it might not be). But I do think if it was more human-like more people would be interested in buying it.
Also the OP says he’s using IBM Watson for it, so I assume that’s better quality than the most basic/oldest text to speech software (even though there are better ones than that).",N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 7:15 am",2020-07-21 17:29:22.424756,

There is no problem. As Fiverr’s Terms of Service clearly states, Fiverr keeps 20% of all revenue you earn through this site. That is how Fiverr is designed to work, therefore, there is no problem.

You agreed to share your revenue with Fiverr when you signed up for your account. This is all clearly noted in the Terms of Service, that you agreed to. Fiverr gets 20%, you keep the remaining 80%.

I just had to complete 50 orders. And of course, make the required amount of money which I feel so lucky to have made in that period especially in these hard times.

With the grace of Almighty Allah, Finally, I have achieved Level 1 Seller Badge . I know it’s easy to be Level One but for me, it’s a huge accomplishment. I am very happy to be promoted . So I thought to share my experience with this community so it can be helpful for new sellers who are struggling.

My Friend Recommended me this platform I joined Fiverr in late February 2020. I had no experience of Freelancing before. I am a Web Designer and WordPress Developer, So I started my services related to WordPress websites Development and Google AdSense.Also, I am currently pursuing my Software Engineering degree and I am in 4th Semester. So the management of both things together was not easy.
So here is how it started, I got my first order after three days of joining I sent the buyer request and it was completed with a win-win situation.
Then my road to Fiverr started and I continued to struggle day and night on this platform and I had a great and wonderful experience. All of my buyers became my client and they still buy my service.
I can still remember once I was fixing the error on the site all night I was working till 8 am in the next morning. Yes, sometimes you have to sacrifice your sleep to achieve something.
I was optimistic, motivated, inspired to achieve this journey.
So here is my advice for new sellers who are struggling.
=> Always do the job the honestly and make sure your buyer is 100% satisfied with you.
=> Never give up if you are not getting orders or if you have no sales, Always look for opportunities, try asking your mentor, your friend and get suggestion from this forum.
=> Never violate any TOS Of Fiverr and you will always be elevated.
=> Never cheat someone and always show integrity and probity.
=> Help achieve someones goals and you will achieve yours.
If you follow these practises I am sure you will be on the road of success. Now I am motivated and hoping to achieve Level 2 Badge , Never stop learning and growing.
This forum helped me a lot to learn more and more. This community has very nice people who always help others and give advice. I thank you all.
I am very thankful to you for reading my story, and journey on Fiverr . Your suggestion and questions will be appreciated. As English is not my mother language so mistakes are possible. I wish you Good luck.
Finally, I will wrap it up with this Quote.

Hi there! Not having been able to see impressions, views and click has nothing to do with demotion. It has to do with Fiverr’s minimum metrics that have to be kept.
In other words, response rate, completion rate, on-time delivery, rating and days without warning are dependent of the seller’s performance, not of Gig stats.",N/A,"Jul 15, 2020 8:31 pm",2020-07-21 17:30:25.782217,

After almost 7 years of services and gigs delivered (thanks to the new evaluation system) I got kicked back to level 0.
When this system was introduced, I went from level 2 to no level at all. I wasn’t making good sales in those days. It took me around 3 months to get back at level 2 again.

If you don’t receive payment for your completed jobs then, I think you can report after 7 days.
Once a seller delivers an order, the buyer does not have to respond at all. Some buyers merely collect the product and move on. After three days, the order autocompletes, and the seller gets paid 14 days later unless they are a Top Rated Seller, and then they get paid in 7 days.
Some buyers complete the order but do not leave a review. Yet other buyers complete the order and leave reviews, but never contact the seller. In both these cases, the seller gets paid 14 days later.
I do not understand why you would report not getting paid after seven days when it takes 14 days for the funds to clear, and then you can withdraw your funds. Unless you mean you do not see the funds for an order in your “earnings,” then you should wait seven days to report that. I would not wait even that long as payment shows immediately after the order is completed.",N/A,"Jul 20, 2020 5:21 pm",2020-07-21 17:32:13.492568,

For me, it has been an awesome journey and experience. I have had great times, bad times, and above all, I have managed to pull myself up every single time and blaze ahead with my freelancing career.
Around the fall of November, last year. I noticed that I was making as much sales as I had made in previous months. I was a little disoriented by it, but still, I just kept at it.
I hardly post here in the forum. But I read comments, suggestions and observations from people like
@jonbaas
and I must say, it was one of his consistent suggestions that allowed me take action.
Reaching out to your target clients outside the Fiverr platform is a sure way to ensure that you can stay on top of your business as a seller on Fiverr.
How can this be achieved?
*This doesn’t involve just posting your gig link randomly on any social media platform, but careful scrutinization of the people who would potentially buy your services.
*Target Facebook groups or regular forums where you have people who are interested in your service one way or the other. A perfect example: I work as a Ghostwriter. Thus, I targeted a popular Facebook Group for Writers , where we have lots of aspiring authors, known publishers, and known writers in the trade. I was able to advertise my services and get orders on a steady basis from there.
*Promote your gig everyday. This doesn’t still entail just posting random gig links on your timeline, but using paid ads (if possible) and something I nicknamed: ASMP (Aggressive Social Media Promotion). A topic of discourse for another day.
I hope you guys have learned a thing or two.
Have a great day!",N/A,N/A,N/A,jonbaas,1,I’m honored to have been an early motivator for your success. Keep up the great work!,N/A,"Jul 21, 2020 3:43 am",2020-07-21 17:33:04.041613,

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:

[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.

Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",hanshuber16,1,"iamsachmusic:

This forum post is dedicated to discussing Fiverr’s ID verification process.

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way.

I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.

You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process.

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.

You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way.

As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!

To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller.

So this process to verify the ID is for everyone using the platform and it doesn’t mean that you did something wrong at any point right ? I suppose everyone will go through it now or later ?
That’s right. Apparently, Fiverr has been experimenting with this ID verification thing since early 2018 (as far as I know). They even did a beta test of the ID verification process in 2018… I think in May 2018? So, yeah, I think they’re slowly rolling it out to everyone.
Taken from Fiverr’s seller help center:
At Fiverr, we’re always doing our best to keep our community safe for everyone, which is why we routinely ask that sellers verify their identity with an official government ID. We’ll only ask you to do this once.
“Routinely ask that sellers verify their identity” makes me think they are planning on doing it in small batches at a time instead of asking everyone to do it all at once.
Here’s an email from a Fiverr CS rep. from May 2018 (during the beta-testing of the Fiverr ID verification):

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",cyaxrex,0,"hanshuber16:
Once you get the notification to verify your ID, you will be directed to the link mentioned in the original post, and you will have to enter your Fiverr login details (in your case Facebook or google login)
I’m sorry, but this simply can’t be correct. If you use FB or Google to login to Fiverr, you login via a security token. Your Google or FB username or password is not the same as your Fiverr password and should not be treated as such.
If when Fiverr directs users to a login area, there is no button to click to login via FB or Google, users will not be able to enter their FB or Google details manually. In this case, can you confirm whether such buttons are present?
If not, FB & Google users may be exempt from ID checks (at least for the time being). Alternatively, it could be that someone has overlooked the need to add FB & Google support, in which case this should be reported to Fiverr asap.",N/A,"Mar 5, 2019 8:25 am",2020-07-21 17:33:35.379170,

Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process.

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone.

Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

I am sorry, but I don’t use Payoneer. So, I have no idea how that works. You’re better off contacting Payoneer about that (imo).
Good luck!

I agree with
@misscrystal
. You are supposed to use your own info. for Fiverr ID verification. It is a violation of Fiverr’s ToS to misrepresent your identity.
Take from the ToS:
Authentic Fiverr Profile - You may not create a false identity on Fiverr, misrepresent your identity, create a Fiverr profile for anyone other than yourself (a real person), or use or attempt to use another user’s account or information; Your profile information, including your description, skills, location, etc., while may be kept anonymous, must be accurate and complete and may not be misleading, illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. Fiverr reserves the right to require users to go through a verification process in order to use the Site (whether by using ID, phone, camera, etc.).",N/A,"Mar 6, 2019 12:09 pm",2020-07-21 17:33:39.182780,

Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

No, there’s no need for a scanned copy.

The only reason I suggested using a premade photo in my original post was because users have reported (on the forum) greater success using this option. Several users have reported issues with using the live photo option (as it can sometimes lead to a dark/blurry image).
However, it is entirely up to you to chose whichever option you think will work best for you

Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",mariashtelle1,1,"misscrystal:

As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller.

Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.

Yep, I think the option to access your phone’s Gallery during the verification process is only available in Android phones (which is what I used).
There’s another thread where a user had reported issues with initiating the verification process on her iPhone, and when she switched to an Android phone, she had no issues. Could it be that this issue is only limited to certain iPhone models? IDK
Unable to verify my ID
Your Fiverr Experience
Hey, Thanks for replying to my comment! So the QR code when I scan with my iPhone will take me to the page to select ID type but I can’t actually select any of them. Same thing happens with the link you sent, it takes me to the page where you can select your ID but I can’t actually select any of them. This is progress from the email link that just takes me to the button that says ‘verify id’ but doesn’t do anything. It’s just like nothing is linked for me to click on. Maybe it’s the type of …

As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",hanshuber16,0,"misscrystal:
y not scanned documents if they are perfectly clear?
It’s very hard for conventional document scanners to match the resolution and sharpness that DSLR cameras/modern smartphone cameras achieve. Scanned documents are usually grainier than photos captured with a good DSLR/smartphone camera; the chances of rejection are, therefore, higher (during the ID verification process).
If, however, you think the scanned documents that you have are of good enough quality to pass the ID verification process, you can choose to use them.",N/A,"Mar 13, 2019 4:48 am",2020-07-21 17:33:44.082269,

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

It worked. Got verified in less than 10 seconds.
They asked for my passport which is due for renewal in 2 months, it has a 10-year-old photo. I honestly felt my current look is different from that of my passport.
I think every Facial recognition algo should match a face with a photo stretching years.

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way.

Did you get a notification from Fiverr asking you to verify your ID? If not, you don’t have to do it right now. You are supposed to verify your ID only after you receive a notification.
In case you’ve received a notification from Fiverr to verify your ID, here are the three steps:
Click the Fiverr ID notification that you received. It will take you to a website where you have the option to either scan a QR code (to get redirected to the ID verification link) or send yourself an email containing the ID verification link. Go to the ID verification link. At this stage, it might ask you to log onto Fiverr.
Click the upload button (depicted by a tiny icon) and take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Then, click the upload button again and take a photo of yourself.
Make sure that the photos are taken in a bright environment, preferably a brightly lit room or outdoors, provided it’s bright and sunny. Also, make sure that the photos taken are very sharp and clear.

You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",mselinabegum747,0,thank you bro…for your info…,N/A,"May 28, 2019 12:19 pm",2020-07-21 17:33:52.340029,

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone.

Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",smithjane1,1,"Hi hanshuber16

As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw).

This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",hanshuber16,3,"Hi,

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.

This has already been debated extensively. Even though Fiverr “guarantees” the safety of our data, there is no guarantee (anywhere on the internet, for that matter) that your data will be safe. I mean, even popular and well-established platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter are prone to hacks and data leaks… so…

Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-21 17:33:59.138661,
SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo.

Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",shamsiboi,0,Thanks buddy for insight.,N/A,"Sep 27, 2019 10:27 am",2020-07-21 17:34:00.914811,

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone.

https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-21 17:34:02.756963,

As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",iqbaltasif,1,"sameernegi:

I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way.

I recommend rconnect with Customer Support for best advice on next steps. They were very helpful when I reached out.

SUCCESSFUL Fiverr ID Verification: Here’s what you need to know,Your Fiverr Experience,126,11.0k,171,"Mar 3, 2019 1:07 pm","Mar 3, 2019 2:36 pm","Jul 21, 2020 3:35 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/successful-fiverr-id-verification-heres-what-you-need-to-know/314289,N/A,hanshuber16,60,"After having had a very intense/busy last week, I expected today to be a lazy Sunday — one of seclusion and contemplation. But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity.

Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-21 17:34:08.294187,

But — oh, no! Life would be too easy (too boring even) if everything went your way, am I right? The Fiverr Gods had other plans in store for me.
As soon as I wake up, I usually check my mobile phone for notifications (I have ALL Fiverr notifications enabled, btw). Sometimes, I also open the Fiverr App just in case there is a notification hiding inside the App (sometimes, push notifications can be unreliable ). But, today, I didn’t see anything in the App either.
After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:

Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process.

Currently I received the verify ID request and I’m definitely afraid of my account being forbidden . I just came here for less than a month and haven’t withdraw my earning for one time!! Finally it’s successful and I’m really breath out so. I tried for two times. First time I signed in via Google account. I also found a bug there that I just can’t successfully sign in by inputting my definitely right User name/Email address and password, I even changed my password once time to prove that! Very annoying , but with luck, the Google account worked well. Then I can’t find any entry button to click to the photo roll and only can make a live photograph (I use iPhone se). I shot the scanning version of my Chinese id card and a studio-made formal profile picture on my iPad with the back camera(12 Mp). After submitting, no any response appear in my email box for nearly an hour, so I think my fist time was failed (not even a inform for the fail) and I decided to try one more time. I think maybe the AI verify technology would not accept the scanning version on my another device so this time I use the raw front camera for my selfie(very casual, didn’t redo much time, and the camera quality is 1.2 Mp ). Back camera for the real ID card, note that having completely no shadow on your avatar because maybe the comparison is mostly made between this photo and your selfie. Then submitted it , for waiting a few more seconds, I received the excited email informing that my verify information has been accepted!! That was really an exciting experience and thanks for the fiverr system to protect our community atmosphere.
Then I can continue my great Monday.

After making myself some breakfast, I opened Fiverr on my PC. I noticed the characteristic magenta/pink dot by the “Messages.” There were still no notifications on the Fiverr App, though. This struck me as strange. Anyway, when I checked the Fiverr notification on my PC, it was the dreaded “Verify your ID to continue on Fiverr” message. Yep, it appeared as a notification. So, please pay attention to those magenta/pink dots and the message that’s shown!
Since there are hardly any posts (from people who have succeeded in their verification process) detailing the entire verification process, I thought I’d give a very detailed description of my experience. Okay, moving on…
When you click on that notification, it takes you to a page where there is a QR code (which directs you to the ID verification link) as well as an option to get the ID verification link (that the QR code directs you to) sent via e-mail. To be honest, I was under the impression that each seller received a unique link which would only work for that seller. However, it was just a generic link which took you to Fiverr’s ID verification page. This is the link that the QR code, as well as the email, directs you to:
https:// www.fiverr. com/id_verification/info
[Note: Hyperlink has been removed. Please do not go to this web-address if you haven’t yet received a notification to verify your ID. I have only shared this info. so that you understand every step of the process.]
Once you go to that link on your smartphone, you will then be asked to enter your Fiverr login details. The verification process will start as soon as you are logged in.
You can access the above-mentioned link via your PC/tablet/laptop, too. However, I am not sure if accessing that link from such devices would ask you to switch to a smartphone to proceed with the verification process. Fiverr suggests you do the verification process on your smartphone, and that’s how I did mine.
The verification process consists of 2 stages:
Take a photo of your passport/driver’s license/ID.
Take a photo of yourself.
You have the option to either go to the camera App on your phone to take a current photo or to access your photos/files on your phone to upload a pre-existing file/photo from your phone. Before proceeding to the next step in the verification process, you can also retake the photos as many ever times as you want until you are satisfied with the quality of the photo.
Just like how someone had already mentioned in a previous thread 74, you can also upload a pre-existing/pre-scanned photo of your document by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone.
I believe the more clear, sharp, focused, and bright (without overexposure, of course) your photos are, the higher is your chance of success.
Therefore, I believe the easiest way to succeed in the verification process is by getting a professionally-made studio-quality photo of your ID and yourself and uploading it during your verification process (by clicking on the icon that allows you to access the photos/files on your phone).
You could also use a scanner to scan your documents, but I believe a professional-quality photo of your ID (taken in a bright environment with diffuse lighting) would have a much higher resolution/quality.
Here’s what I personally did:
I stuck my ID onto the middle of a plain white paper (with double-sided tape). I then turned ALL the lights in my room on to ensure that the room was brightly lit and that the light was very diffuse. This was to ensure that there was no shadow projecting onto the ID while taking its photo. I rested the sheet of paper (with my ID) on a wall and then took a photo. Please make sure that the photo looks sharp and bright. I then uploaded the photo to my PC and edited it further for better brightness and image clarity. I then sent the edited image to my phone and started the verification process. In the first step, I clicked on the icon to access files on my phone and uploaded this edited image of my ID. Despite putting in all the effort to ensure that the edited photo was as bright as possible, the final uploaded image in step 1 looked dull/dark. But that didn’t seem to be an issue.
This is the end of the verification process. You will then get a message saying that Fiverr has received your photos and that they will inform you of the result.
Hardly 5 seconds after that, I got an email saying that I’d successfully verified my ID.

.
.
.
I also got a notification on Fiverr.


I would also like to mention that the ID that I’d uploaded was not an entirely English document. It had German, English, and French. So, I think Fiverr accepts non-English documents, too.
I did not see any information pertaining to the number of attempts I had available and the deadline for successful verification of ID prior to account suspension. Some users have claimed that you only have 15 days to verify your ID and that you only have 3 attempts. I am not sure if Fiverr has changed this in any way. Or maybe you’re shown that info. only after you fail in verifying your ID? I don’t know.
Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the ID verification process. I’d be glad to help y’all out.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/3X/d/f/df6403c42fbb244c7609ea058d8f5f4f8a394e27.png,6,"Mar 3, 2019 3:19 pm",doby90028,0,Failed i.d. verification.

I was reviewing my pay out method and looking forward to know what you guys prefer.
I always used to use PayPal but thinking to shift to Bank Transfer now.
Here’s a rough calculation that made me think about trying Bank Transfer. Let me know if I am short of knowledge about this.
Let’s take $1000 payout as example:
1) PayPal option:
PayPal to Bank ($999 @ 61.84/-) = INR 61778.16
2) Bank Transfer Option:
Net USD transfered = $1000 @ 62 (approx) = INR 62,000.00

Do you buy things just because the seller used a certain keyword? No, you buy it because you want it and it’s an exceptional option with little competition.

or whatever you are, I was never and will never think what you think I thought when I typed my remarks. My mind doesn’t work like that. I know I make mistakes in my grammar. And I know I can not spot them sometimes. It is human nature. It is not a mistake we should be embarrassed or trade we should be ashamed of. If I send Vickie my file she would spot mistakes in a heartbeat, and if she sends me hers it would happen the same, but if we sit in front of our own papers and gaze for hours we could not spot them.
