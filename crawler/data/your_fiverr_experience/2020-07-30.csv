suggested.
Do I need to change my phone number and other account details before closing this account?
I am going through the process of changing my username and I have followed the instructions to successfully change the primary email address I used for initial registration to a secondary email address. I have done this so I could be able to re-use my primary email once I close this account and sign-up for a new one.
Now, what is not clear to me is whether I would need to also change the other details from my profile page before closing my account, for instance:
• Phone number
• Profile picture
• Education history
• Certification record, etc.

Never exploit yourself to avoid a bad review. All legitimate buyers take reviews with a grain of salt plus you can respond to share your side of the story.

After talking for a long time with him, I decide to do it for him, because he was not willing to yield.
So after I have done all of this, he asks for a partial refund, because he believes that because he didn’t use the first song I made for him, he should get that part of the money back. And he keeps pressing the revision button!
I contact Fiverr Customer Support, and after checking that I did everything right (she confirmed me this), she told me that they cannot do anything, they cannot force the buyer to accept the order, and that maybe I should cancel this order and create a new one for a lower price to refund him that money.
I did everything correctly, even more than what was included in my service. I don’t want to lose the money, and I don’t want to also cancel an order because it will affect my stats as a seller.

TOS:
Orders are not eligible to be cancelled based on the quality of service/materials delivered by the Seller if the service was rendered as described in the Gig Page. Buyers may rate their experience with the Seller on the Order Page, including the overall level of service quality received.
Deny the cancellation and redeliver the order. As long as the re-delivery matches the scope of the original order, you should be fine. I glanced at one of your gigs and didn’t find anything in it that defines what a ‘revision’ is for that gig. If it’s in your requirements, that’s fair, but there’s a lot of risk without the boundaries. (Please see FAQ point 1)
TOS:
Buyers may use the “Request Revisions” feature located on the Order Page while an Order is marked as Delivered if the delivered materials do not match the Seller’s description on their Gig page or they do not match the requirements sent to the Seller at the beginning of the order process.
Requesting to gain more services from Sellers beyond the agreed requirements by using the Request Revisions button is not allowed.
Fiverr Customer Support will cancel orders based on, but not limited to, the following reasons:
…
Buyers who abuse the Request Revisions button to gain more services from Sellers beyond the agreed requirements.
Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Gig on Fiverr, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller’s Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyrights for the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights therein.
…
All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the Gig and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason.
You may have to remind the buyer that, if they cancel, they cannot use what was delivered.",N/A,"Jul 23, 2020 9:34 pm",2020-07-30 00:52:19.235292

After I have done everything for a client (a 4 min song, with multiple instruments, vocals, and lyrics) he said that he doesn’t like, and now he wants to do something completely different (sing over a backing track). After talking for a long time with him, I decide to do it for him, because he was not willing to yield.
So after I have done all of this, he asks for a partial refund, because he believes that because he didn’t use the first song I made for him, he should get that part of the money back. And he keeps pressing the revision button!
I contact Fiverr Customer Support, and after checking that I did everything right (she confirmed me this), she told me that they cannot do anything, they cannot force the buyer to accept the order, and that maybe I should cancel this order and create a new one for a lower price to refund him that money.
I did everything correctly, even more than what was included in my service. I don’t want to lose the money, and I don’t want to also cancel an order because it will affect my stats as a seller.

If you went through my reviews, you’d notice the buyer has left many laudatory 5 star ones, but the buyer showed an uglier side with this last order, flaring unprofessionalism, immaturity, and TOS violations.

How badly do you want to put this behind you?
If you want it over and done with, maybe offer him a $8 ‘refund’? Not the full amount, but sometimes even a partial will be satisfactory, as it acknowledges both sides.
There was a thread that discussed, with CS, creating a new order with the ‘refund’ and accepting cancellation on the first in exchange and understanding that CS would remove the expected bad review. It was set up and arranged with CS beforehand, and the seller had documented proof that CS said they would remove the bad review, due to the buyer breaking the ToS.

In reality, It is not about $8, or $15. It is about the cancellation affecting my stats as a seller, and the buyer getting away with breaking the ToS. As I said, I even did 2 whole different services for him, and he still doesn’t want to pay the full amount and doesn’t care about the cancelation affecting me.

It’s going to turn off a lot of employers to share even a fee bucks in the first place or other might commission out of Fiverr when every feature starts to be nickel and dimed excessively.",N/A,N/A,N/A,erik_keresztes,1,I really doubt they will reduce the fee at all.,N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 10:50 pm",2020-07-30 00:52:30.656045

From what I’ve read and discussed here, almost every experienced seller has had at least one such encounter at one point.
Apart from what you said, from my own experience, other scamming methods include buyers messaging you with a job proposal, conditioned by you delivering a part of the work as a free sample, so they “can check if you are eligible for the project”, after which they simply ghost you, OR buyers who abuse the revision button (it doesn’t matter how many free revisions you offer, or if you even do that), keep asking for modifications, change their requirements each time, and, after you perhaps did twice or thrice the job for only the initial fee, end up asking for order cancellation.
Be careful with such red flags and, when possible, in the first situation, try to direct them to your portfolio on your gig page rather than provide a large amount of free samples.
Other than that, there are plenty of honest, great buyers out here (the majority of the buyers, I’d say), who appreciate sellers’ work, offer tips, don’t ask for unnecessary revisions etc. I hope you will not encounter (too many) other scammers from now on!",N/A,"Apr 22, 2020 10:25 pm",2020-07-30 00:52:51.465792

If you mean why do you get so many spam messages, who knows. If you get more scams than legit buyers it’s more a reflection of your business strategy than of Fiverr. Maybe you’re superfluous in your market. Have you researched to see how many competitors you have here offering the same thing you do? Not something you can blame on Fiverr.
You’re selling writing but you write poorly. That may also be why you aren’t getting buyers. Reflect on your performance instead of asking if Fiverr is the cause of you not getting buyers.

You do not have to be so rude and attack everyone personally who disagrees with you. Human is not only social but also kind, considerate, compassionate, helpful, and tolerant of other humans who might be completely different from them.
If you never had such an encounter, you can safely ignore the post and continue your amazing work! Nobody forced you to comment here. For your kind information, I am not a native English speaker and I have learned everything on my own. No special classes, amazing teachers, or mentors. And I am constantly learning everything I could in each domain. That is the basic essence of evolution. This is my first month on this platform and I offered services related to medical writing, translation, data entry, and others. I would say this again. Feedback should never be regarded as an accusation. If you have time and energy to point out the better version of my gigs, I’d surely change it. That’s what feedback is meant for. Not to spend time defending something you could have better spent correcting it if the feedback was genuine.

Seeing someone sell something they aren’t proficient at it still a huge red flag even if people are interested in other things you appear to be proficient. It hurts your image regardless.
If I’m a grocery store selling stale bread, you’re going to think poorly of me even if my other products are fresh.

The issue I think we are dealing with here is when someone claims to be selling images from major commercial stock photo/image companies at prices far below the price offered directly by the source, and without the specific restrictions noted in the licensing ToS at the original commercial site. In THESE cases, I think it is fair to be suspicious about the legality of the offer. Especially when the buyer MIGHT face legal consequences for using them.

What about licensing?",N/A,N/A,N/A,artemist,0,"Stock Photo/Image companies are quite specific on this. A buyer can buy the right to use an image as PART of a project, but usually can’t re-package and/or re-sell unaltered images.



If you buy this gig and use these images, then the original source COULD question you about how you got the rights to use it. They PROBABLY won’t, since they sell these over and over again to various graphic artists for use in projects. They know that the those artists/designers will likely in turn “sell” the resulting project to a customer, but the original purchase agreement almost never alows re-sale of the unaltered image – just sale of a product (book cover, poster, calendar, etc.) made with the image.



But your question is good. You don’t even know if the gig seller at Fiverr is even really BUYING/LICENSING the images from the Stock company in the first place. They may just be doing screen grabs or stealing images through a fake account or from a corporate account where they work. If you buy and use these, at least make a screen grab of the gig offering and sales receipt. If your use is challenged later, you can at least claim you bought them in “good faith” which might limit your damages. But how will you ever be able to find the gig seller to share the blame? A buyer of stolen property does not always get out of the situation cleanly once the truth is made known.



Unfortunately, the only way to make the gig even seem legit is for the seller to make a clear statement like, “The images you recieve through this gig are legally licensed from a major stock photo seller and I have the right to sell them to you for you to use as you chose.” But since no stock photo company really offers those terms, it would be a lie to claim that. So anyone buying this gig is probably either:



a. unaware of standard policies in stock image law

b. getting lied to about what they are buying

c. perhaps even TRYING to indirectly steal images themselves by “buying” them this way



(Note: Yes, some few stock photo/image sources do offer “free” images, but even those few don’t allow commercial resale of their unaltered images.)",N/A,"Sep 12, 2013 3:18 am",2020-07-30 00:53:50.897554

If Fiverr had a “flagging” system for gigs and Forum posts that would get these items looked at quickly, then they would not just be there tempting others to buy them or copy them.

The problem right now is that, if you’ve never done it before, you won’t know how long it takes to do anything. There was a section in my projects management textbook that stated the general IT sector had a bad habit of underestimating resources needed to finish projects. (The hypothesis was because the industry is so new, it’s hard to predict.) Since you’re new, you cannot risk taking on a project for a paying client that has expectations of a specific deadline.

PPC requires customers to trust you with their money. I handled this at my day job for a time, and it’s tricky - particularly in high competition industries. Trusting a beginner with PPC isn’t the safest thing to do, and PPC is all about ROI. Learn the industry first, before offering your skills. It’s similar to offering accountancy services with no knowledge of accounting - you can very easily blow a budget on Google Ads within 1 day with no return. It can be incredibly rewarding, so good luck with learning how to run succesful ad campaigns! App Sumo has a crash course ebook for free on this, I think.

Honestly, I know that fiverr Terms of Service ( https://www.fiverr.com/terms_of_service ) and Feedback Policy ( https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/feedback ) aren’t cleat enough about this.

Maybe you should have said something different than you were too busy to handle the request at that point. Maybe say your revision option is for revising the existing images that were specified in the original requirements and not for resizing brand new images that weren’t previously specified (or some better way of putting that). Maybe put your revision policy in the gig description. Also you could mention that the offer didn’t include revisions (and maybe that you will revise the existing images if needed).
If CS check the messages they need to see the reason (eg. that the request was outside what was agreed/additional work rather revisions to existing stuff) and not just that you were too busy to do the request.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 6:27 pm",2020-07-30 00:54:31.976495

I received my order on time but it is a vague 56 word “reading” that gave little info, including that I had black magic around me.

I received my order on time but it is a vague 56 word “reading” that gave little info, including that I had black magic around me.

I would really inform myself before ordering an akashic record reading and I would definitely look for some professionalism. With all honesty, in your shoes I would probably feel scammed, because all this “Black magic” and then “I can break it” speaks for itself.
I always recommend buyers to pay attention at communication. That’s the crucial part where professionalism can be spot on. I always show portfolio of my previous work to my potential clients and I explain them what to expect.
If the seller in your case can seem unprofessional, at them same time you should have informed yourself better.
I invite you to pay attention as this website is full of freelancers and I am sorry that some bad experiences can hide those who work really hard to satisfy their clients.

The weather is hot during the day (around 27-30 degrees), and cold at night (it can be even 7 degrees). Baltic Sea is cold in general, and water temperature is 18-22 degrees, but it’s totally fine for me. It’s like going to Spain in October.
However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

Level 1 seller
You will surprised if you make a text conversation with a level 1 seller… You will must say that… The seller is perfect. His most important thik is that… He will do his work in time. You will not get only all the thing that he wrote in his gig but also you will get more then that. He will never promise you anything that he will not able to do.
New seller - he just trying to convince his gig visitor. When i asked them… Please send me sample… He says that. I will make a new one for you… Ooohh Rubbish. Why you did not make a sample of your work? Why will i buy your gig??? They most of the time offer unlimited revision… Please do not do this… Give a option to your buyer like…i will give you 5 revision in 10 dollars. Or what you want to do his job very perfectly.
Always be clear. Keep clear… This is my opinion to all new seller…and all respective seller. Fiverr is the best place.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-30 00:57:43.966812

Hi, My name is Marina from Europe (Croatia). I have 14 years of professional experience, and I just recently joined Fiverr as a provider of graphic design services. I want to cooperate with you on this, but I would like to have a conversation before the actual offer and order to talk about details. The budget is negotiable and depends on what you need except just logo designing. All my designs are my own custom made, hand-drawn and computer-processed and I offer logo, overlays, animations, and video clips. But the price depends on the complexity of your vision. Please check not only mine but every seller’s portfolio (certificates) before making an order and make sure to contact whoever comes in last selection through the inbox to have more details on what you require. Kind regards, Marina

If your buyer still insist to get more free revisions for you…, then you have three options:
Refuse to do more revisions, Buyer mad at you, and giving you bad rate
Do many revisions needed, waste your time and energy ( not sure if he will give you good rate)

That too is terrible advice. Offer a specific number of revisions and charge for any additional ones. I do not even mention that I offer revisions. Why remind them that it is an option?
I may give a buyer one or two small revisions but charge for anymore. It may seem like a good idea to offer unlimited revisions, but we have seen on the Forum that buyers have come back months later, and when the seller complains to CS, they will back the buyer. Unlimited means without end. It is up to you to put a limit on your revisions if you do not want to deal with buyers coming back once the order is complete.
Another option is to say unlimited revision while the order is active. Once it is closed by the seller or auto-completes in 3 day you are done.",N/A,"Jul 27, 2020 2:26 pm",2020-07-30 00:59:36.008848

The requests disappear from the active list if you’re a level 0 seller and enough other level 0 sellers have sent an offer (10?). A buyer can stop (or pause I think) a request or it can automatically stop (not be shown in any active list, including level 1 seller or above) after 30 days, though I think the buyer can resubmit then so occasionally I think there can be requests > 30 days old (but the vast majority won’t be >30 days old).
They don’t automatically disappear from the list when someone has found the work.

How long does it normally take for a buyer to accept an offer?
Probably normally within a few days I think (eg. within 3-4 days I’d guess normally). Maybe the highest chance is on the same day the request is posted. eg. if they message you and you can show you can do the job they want.

A Gig change can cost you more than you think,"Your Fiverr Experience
My Fiverr Gigs",0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/a-gig-change-can-cost-you-more-than-you-think/491846,N/A,hassannawaz0303,1,"Hello Everyone.Today I am going to share with you something which I have experienced myself in the recent past.
So back in April this year when I joined Fiverr, there were quite a few chances that you could make any alterations without having any trouble (at least I made quite a few without having any trouble back then).
Recently I had to make a few changes to my gigs (3 of them) so I altered them. It was the time when my gigs where ranking high and was getting quite a good amount of orders on daily basis. But, soon after I made a few changes in my gigs, I noticed that I was all of a sudden receiving less and less orders and soon they were vanished. I was stunned at this so I thought to search my gigs in the search results where to my expectations I found none of them. Worried at this, I contacted Fiverr CS and found that the the gigs after any alterations shall be subjected to review by the Fiverr team. Worried already enough, I made a ticket for all of my gigs.
After that I got the same conventional auto-reply saying “There is a lot of work load and your request may take upto 10 days to get resolved”. After that I had to wait for more than a week or so to receive the delightful response “Hey Hassan your gigs are back”. In the meantime when my gigs were out of sight, I received almost no orders except for the ones I received through responding to buyer request.
The problem isn’t that the Fiverr team wants to review the gig changes, but actually it is that the review process is taking way too long which results in sellers loosing many potential clients.
I expect the Fiverr team will work on this and will try to make the CS response rate higher than what it is nowadays
I am not sure if I am the only one who underwent such experience. If you have been through this too, please don’t forget to share yours and state any update on this one

Regular",0,"Welcome to the Fiverr forums.
If you don’t want to market yourself, then making bids/offers to Buyer Requests is really your only option. You’ll likely be growing slowly, if you take this route, and your gigs and offers will need to be at their best.
You have 1 hour of read-time shown in your forum profile, which is a good start, but I only saw interaction with one thread in “Tips”. Check out the Tips For Sellers category (forum.fiverr.com/c/Fiverr-Tips/tips-for-sellers/l/top/all?order=views <-- with filters applied). You’ll find hundreds of threads offering advice on a variety of things to consider and/or improve. (Note: Not all advice can apply to all gigs or categories. Be sure you check multiple sources as there are some false tips, even among the top threads.)
It takes a lot of work to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.
“If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” (Attributed to Benjamin Franklin)

Introduction – This is not a list on how to make gigs. This is for gigs that are already made that are under-performing, need an overhaul, or just need somewhere to start for self-evaluation/education. It does contain a few general-information bits, and can help during gig creation, but that is neither the focus nor the intent.

I’ve been selling on Fiverr for seven years now. Anecdotally I can tell you that the number of sellers has gone through the roof in recent months. The competition is fierce and sadly the many new bad sellers drown out the good sellers.
You only need to spend 10 minutes browsing the forums to see posts like “new seller what do I do?” and “new seller no sales” and “new seller can I buy reviews?”.
Again anecdotally, long-term sellers who had built a good reputation prior to the boom in new sellers still appear to be doing well, but many new sellers are struggling.
There’s no point in giving up as you’ve done the hard bit already (creating your gigs) - but maybe just let your gigs be and hope that a buyer comes along.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 6:16 am",2020-07-30 01:02:22.286103

That’s one thing I try to avoid. I don’t think it’s a good idea to sell your experience for cheap. But as competition grows the price is falling. Who profits? Not the average seller I’d say.

I definitely see your point. My regular clients pay for my expertise and experience in the field, rather than my hours or the overheads, and for someone like me, I can afford to charge much less than my usual - especially on Fiverr, where others offering the same service charge anywhere between $5 and $30, and some even use stolen stock.
For me, I want to bulk up my client base, and get a backlog of excellent reviews on Fiverr. Once I’ve achieved that, my prices will go back to normal (with a small increase compared to my normal rates to cover fees). It’s an approach that I believe has worked. Would the customers I’ve had so far have paid my normal rates? Possible, but also it’s unlikely.
I do agree with the sentiment that prices fall as competition increases. Fiverr sellers in my industry consistently undercharge for their services (as mentioned above, some shadier sellers even use stolen images and unlicensed fonts!) which has made some customers believe that these lower rates are the norm.

My plan!

For me, I want to bulk up my client base, and get a backlog of excellent reviews on Fiverr. Once I’ve achieved that, my prices will go back to normal
Great, if this strategy works for you! I hope “your” customers will stay with you after your prices gone back to normal. My fear would be: they would choose the next newbie on fiverr who is selling for cheap and so on.

Perhaps you can find a strategy for Fiverr that works for you

Thanks for your comments…",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:22 am",indigo_dc,2,"As a buyer, I find it very, very hard to find quality sellers. Although not in the market for audio - almost all of what I need is graphic design - I’m primarily looking for either quick concepts to flesh out my designs and get it ready to prototype, then later on I need professional work to truly bring the product to life.
What I find is an absolute glut of cheap, generally quite poor sellers where all their gigs look identical. I’ve tried a few and they have all been an utter waste of money. It’s now leading me to leave the platform because the tools available to me as a buyer mean I can’t find artists who are maybe more expensive than the basic $5 gig but below the $50 gig, and who are able to not only listen to the brief BUT add some inspiration into the mix.
If that sounds like I’m asking for “cheap top tier creativity”, I’m not really - I guess what I want to be able to find are sellers where I can say roughly what I want and at minimum, get that. But what I’d love are sellers where I say roughly what I want, get that but also something of the seller’s creativity & personality there that will really set things apart - and when I find that, you can be damn sure I’ll be paying for more of it.
Finding THESE kind of gigs as a buyer has so far been impossible, so I empathise with you from the other side of the fence.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 5:19 am",2020-07-30 01:02:34.635761

What I find is an absolute glut of cheap, generally quite poor sellers where all their gigs look identical.
I think there are sellers around who just use algorithmic logo generators and try to sell this as unique logo to you. (If you are looking for logos) I have seen some youtube advice about that.
But in the end: if you are just willing to buy for 5 bucks you won’t get quality work. (I’m not speaking of you, just general)
It also depends on where you live. If you are working from a country with low costs you have the advantage to charge less. But here in Germany a freelancer has to charge around 50€ per hour or more to be profitable…",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 8:23 am",2020-07-30 01:02:35.797918

I am just starting out on Fiverr from Nigeria and I was wondering how to go about withdrawing earned funds to Nigerian account knowing how Paypal treats us here.
If I got it correctly, the way out is:
set up payooner account as a Nigerian.
link my Nigerian local bank account to Payooner,
While withdrawing fund from Fiverr, use Bank Deposit option on Fiverr to enable me link my Payooner account with Fiverr.
That way the money ought to go straight to my local bank account.
If for any reason the money lodges in my payooner account, from payooner I should initiate deposit into my local bank, Charges applies. And usually takes 3-5 working days to arrive at local account.
Hope I got it correctly. Anything I am missing please?",N/A,"Jun 26, 2020 3:55 am",2020-07-30 01:03:26.141174

That sounds suspicious indeed, but yes, unless you can prove anything, probably nothing will happen.
I guess you could tell support about your suspicion and attach screenshots of the circumstantial evidence (buyer saying they are happy, then leaving that 1* review out of the blue, and you seeing that they leave the same 1* review and review text for other sellers) - did he only ever leave 1* reviews, or other star ratings too, and how many in total? If it was just for you and one other seller, that doesn’t prove much, however, if he ordered from 10 different sellers and left each of them the same 1* and review text, support might more readily tend to agree that it’s suspicious.
They might tell you that they are looking into this but won’t be able to tell you anything because of their privacy policy, or that a buyer is entitled to leave any review they see fit unless it violates the terms of service.
If you’re lucky and the support person thinks it’s fishy too, maybe they’ll keep an eye on that person’s account and find out sooner if they indeed are a competing seller on another account.
And of course, there’s always the possibility that it’s just some kind of “fake” person, not in the sense you meant (being a “fake buyer” and in fact a competitor and just buying for the purpose of leaving bad reviews), but in the sense of being someone who’ll say “great, I’m happy with this” to your face and then leaving a bad review because some revisions were needed and it wasn’t exactly as they wanted it right away, or whatever. Same as the “I never give 5* because nothing on Earth is perfect” people, those exist.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 4:22 pm",2020-07-30 01:03:49.231392

I recently fell victim to a buyer which is constantly giving fake 1-star reviews. I am a video editor. When I delivered the order, he was happy. I even delivered him more than my gig listings. He was happy and he acknowledged that the work is good. After a couple of revisions he accepted the delivery. After two days of this, he came and left a negative 1-star review for no reason except to prevent my account from being promoted to level coming evaluation. I even messaged him to tell me the reason so that we can resolve it. I was ready to even deliver the order again making it from scratch. But he never replied!
After this, I checked and asked other sellers he had worked with. They had exactly the same experience with the buyer. They even got the same review and comment as I did.

Anyway, keep an eye on them. Fiverr will ban their gigs if Fiverr sees them stealing content. They will probably be banned. I had a similar situation here over 5 years ago. I have a forum posting gig, and I work with a lot of other forum posters. So, I caught this guy copying my content word for word, not even changing it or anything. What this guy would do is, he would copy my posts from another forum, and post them on another forum they’re working on. This is how I caught the person. I told Fiverr and they removed the guys gig.
Funnily enough, I caught the guy posting in a topic about users losing their gigs/seller status, and he comes in saying he didn’t know why lol. I ended up responding to that post, but he never replied.
I actually caught another seller recently copying my posts, as we were both working the same forums. It’s easy to catch when they copy/paste and change nothing. I was able to talk to the guy and told him to cut it out, otherwise I’d report him to fiverr. I told him he can take ideas from my topics, but he can’t outright copy/paste. He’d have to make the posts his own, in his own words. I’m cool with that. Just don’t copy my work, that’s all.
Anyway, sorry for posting this wall of text. Keep reporting the profiles as you see them. They will eventually be taken down. Here’s hoping fiverr moves fast here.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 11:46 am",2020-07-30 01:03:59.454663

Anyone have any ideas of how I can get these gigs removed? Fiverr support are yet to respond.

Regular",0,"Buyers put out requests. Sellers make offers. If a buyer wants to accept a $5 offer, that’s their prerogative. Also, you don’t know what other sellers are bidding. Unless it’s stated in the request itself, some buyers put that ‘$5’ in as a placeholder. It’s your job to make an honest bid. If the seller wants too much for $5, either put your estimate for how much the task will actually cost, or only offer what you’re willing to provide for $5.

Buyers went “missing”,Your Fiverr Experience,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/buyers-went-missing/493331,N/A,rogerhii,1,"First, do let me clarified that I’m a new seller, offering gigs on drawing anime arts (illustration thingy).
So the thing is I mentioned in my gigs to let the buyers message me before making order as I don’t wish any misunderstanding or cancellation happens. And I do received several PM from different buyers in the past few days, some from buyer request, some from my gigs. (Which I would consider a good thing as they are my potential customers.) The messages generally start with the buyers, saying what they want from my gigs. However, most of them didn’t provide enough details and therefore I always reply them to ask for more details.
The problem is some of them didn’t reply to my message and I’m sure they are online. I did ask them whether they are interested to continue after a period of time (say like half or a full day), but they still didn’t reply.
The another problem comes up when I have done discussing with the buyers on their expected outcome. Instead of offering a custom offer that match the buyers’ needs directly, I always ask them in message whether they are okay with the price. And they just went “missing” after seeing the message! I do check the last online clock and they did online. I did ask them whether they are interested to continue after a period of time. But no reply from them too (I did saw them online).
I just want to know what causes these scenarios to happens? I’m guessing are they trying to get cheap stuff from me just because I’m a new seller (which they might assume I will weigh orders & reviews more than money). The buyers shows high interests on my gigs before I offer the price. I did offer a reasonable prices that match with what they needs, all the costs are stated on my gigs. And they just went “missing” after knowing the price. Not even a reply.
What should I do to things like these? Should I just swallow it and offer a low price to please the buyers just because I’m a newbie here?",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-07-30 01:04:09.605830

Listen it wouldn’t be the end of the world. When you’re in business you’re bound to get a negative feedback from a buyer. Just keep pushing forward, I encourage Sellers to stop selling themselves short by accepting peanuts. Know your worth, don’t allow Buyers to dictate how you should run your business, never fear Buyers. This is your Business, take the wheel.",N/A,"Jul 27, 2020 11:19 pm",2020-07-30 01:04:46.590535

Fiverr is a platform, they have their way of working. I have not had that experience with CS, but in the case of this post it is worse to accept the cancellation directly without trying to contact the CS and show the point of view and expose that case.
It is not good to generalize, there are situations where CS has helped people, and in any case I had a situation and because I did not seek contact with CS I did not have the opportunity to solve the problem.

Its Mutual when buyer says seller’s work quality is not what he asked and sends request, would any seller accept ? would say Yes My quality is bad lets mutually cancel that ?
Fiverr suggest to work that out mutually first, whatever the reason, If it stop droping OC rate there would be lots of mutual cancellation everyday , even on small mistake or even when seller wouldn’t be able to do job after starting order…I guess things would be messed up and there would be way more cancellation everyday , would that help gaining more reputation to platform ?",N/A,"Jul 22, 2020 12:24 pm",2020-07-30 01:05:00.385909

Fiverr suggest to work that out mutually first, whatever the reason
You’re missing point by point. Yes, Fiverr suggest we work it out, and yes we did in this example, buyer has wrongly placed an order. Mutual cancellation happened, buyer will get refunded and move on to other seller. But the seller? Boom, completion rate goes down. So what Fiverr is actually suggesting is “Hey, sorry the thing doesn’t goes the way you liked it, but let’s cancel this order so the buyer can still spent money on us, but hey, let’s lower your completion rate as well for something you don’t have full control. Sounds good?”
surajrenuka:
If it stop droping OC rate there would be lots of mutual cancellation everyday
Just another mere assumptions. Normal sellers wouldn’t simply asking for cancellation as most of them need sales and reviews. But if cancellation is unavoidable, this will be totally unhelpful for them.
surajrenuka:
I guess things would be messed up and there would be way more cancellation everyday , would that help gaining more reputation to platform ?
Another mere assumption. Unless you’re part of Fiverr team who really knows how the internal Fiverr system works, I will take your words as assumption. But, naah. These issue has becoming a controversial issue for a long time and the seller keep complaining about this the whole time since the the level ranking system was implemented. If you’re asking me, Fiverr reputation is all in lowest due to this cancellation system. Maybe improving the system may gain the reputation instead?",N/A,"Jul 22, 2020 1:02 pm",2020-07-30 01:05:01.204357

As I already said, CS would help in this case. Now, if you are saying CS takes days let them take…seller loose nothing but buyer has to wait to get his funds back AND he has to because he made a mistake !!
radennorfiqri:
Normal sellers
Who are they ?
If I go to vacation keep fiverr profile active all them time and buyer place right order, I will instantly cancel that mutually saying I am on vacation but My fiverr will remain Active all the time…lets just keep cancelling all the orders I get on vacation but I wont pause my fiverr because it takes long time to have orders when I come back , lets enjoy vacation foolling fiverr !
radennorfiqri:
Unless you’re part of Fiverr team who really knows how the internal Fiverr system works
I think I don’t need to be in fiverr team to assume that ? its more like common sense…I have seen seller who even don’t wait to listen requirements and eager to start order with buyer…we call it mekesell here right ? Removing this system could defiantly encourage them and many more I bet !
radennorfiqri:

Will defiantly gain more reputation by improving system…but this is totally different thing then what we are discussing here.
More cancellations lead to Extra time for productivity and more Buyers complaining about seller westing my time and cancelled order…I recently read buyer complaining about seller…seller said he cant do Job because his computer system cant handle load of his work…It was done after 10 days…and was mutuall I guess !",N/A,"Jul 22, 2020 1:15 pm",2020-07-30 01:05:01.622292

So I assume fiverr charge 3% of total of an order, let’s said $10 I get $7 but I will get the fund after the order completed. This is BIG game changer to those who work fiverr full-time.

Fiverr’s marketplace is open for sellers to offer any creative and productive service they wish to propose. With that being said, we ask to refrain from offering any unethical service. For example, taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) or requesting academic work to be done for you, is unethical since it violates most schools’ Honor Codes and constitutes copyright infringement. Fiverr does not allow this type of fraudulent activities and it will not be permitted on our platform.
The above is from the Community Standards.

Absolutely, I get this. But a non-native speaker using the dictionary definition of ‘essay’ will understand the word to be a synonym of ‘article’.
There are some sellers who are blatantly advertising academic services when they use the word essay, but I have to say that in my opinion

She can’t access it because you’re using Google hosting and sending her the link.
Just export the file to a spreadsheet and send it to her as an attachment.
You shouldn’t have made a new account without permission. Read the rules before doing something.
Also, while I totally agree that Fiverr needs an objective way to prevent sellers from doing academic work, their policies don’t say essays aren’t allowed. If they aren’t, Fiverr ought to say this. Any legitimate magazine or newspaper has essays so it’s not unreasonable for people to think it’s okay.",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 4:55 am",2020-07-30 01:08:32.084865

Therefore, if you discover that something in your project does violate the terms of service, then I would issue a refund to avoid any repercussions. If not, then I would decline the refund request and politely refer the client to customer support for further assistance. As long as nothing you did violates fiverr’s terms of service then you should be in the clear. Hope this helps and good luck!",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 11:48 am",2020-07-30 01:10:16.906507

Shock.
Here is a rundown of my warnings:
1: A few years back I used the delivery button in a wrong way, totally my bad, lesson learned.
2: A few months back, a customer asked for my email address. In a stressed moment, I did not think straight and gave it to him. Stupid, shit happens.
Now 3: I ‘tricked’ the system. I actually had to send 5 emails (the guy must have hated me) to get some more details. They think I tricked the system to share my phone number with a client. What?
I don’t even really understand what that is supposed to mean. Apart from that, I would never share my phone number with a client, I live in South America and receiving calls would be expensive, nor do I want clients in my private WhatsApp.
Now apparently Trust & Safety is reviewing my account. I know there is no fixed timeline, and I’m not asking for it. I just would like to know how you would approach this accusation? Would you send further emails to CS or would you trust in the Trust & Safety team to make a fair decision?
I’m level two with 270+ 5 star reviews with tons of returning customers. My intention was never to take clients off Fiverr, because I absolutely love this platform and what freedom it brings to my life.

Unfortunately, the only thing you can do, at this point, is wait for Fiverr for complete their review of your account. I don’t recommend persisting on messages to CS, as they don’t like that.

I think Fiverr allows multiple audio samples (not my category, so not sure), so you could try offering more samples, show some variance like 3/4 time and/or a different key signature.
Please see (FAQ) point 1: Basics to Improve Your Gig. A helpful breakdown and guide
Also you have the tags [bass] [fretless] [fretless bass], meaning that your wasting that last tag space. I would recommend changing the [fretless bass] tag to [guitar], as that will cover anyone who searches for ‘bass guitar’. I’m tempted to also recommend changing [five strings] to [player] as that will cover anyone who searches for ‘bass player’ or ‘fretless player’, but [five string] is unique enough that people looking specifically for that would see your gig early in the search results.

You only have 2 minutes of read-time shown in your forum profile. Check out the Tips For Sellers category (forum.fiverr.com/c/Fiverr-Tips/tips-for-sellers/l/top/all?order=views <-- with filters applied).

It takes a lot of work to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.

Of course, it is not useless. It is valuable to know how many times your gig is shown to users and how many clicks you gain from those impressions. You can use this information to analyze if your gig thumbnail, starting price, or headline should be improved to increase your conversion of impressions into clicks.
Yes, some users may quickly scroll through a page, but they still had the chance to stop and look at your gig.

A gig’s name should state what you do. There are only so many ways to say the same thing, so once you clearly capture the point of the gig, there’s no need to modify it further.
Fiverr claims that videos can help, but don’t make a video unless it can help better explain or better show what you do. A video will become the ‘main’ gig image, so in a way, they replace the main thumbnail.

Introduction – This is not a list on how to make gigs. This is for gigs that are already made that are under-performing, need an overhaul, or just need somewhere to start for self-evaluation/education. It does contain a few general-information bits, and can help during gig creation, but that is neither the focus nor the intent.

A couple of suggestions:
We’re not allowed to link to our Behance profiles. Your gig could get removed if you continue to do that. Flickr is allowed, however.
Your opening line isn’t particularly strong. In fact, it’s very cliched. It feels like a third of Fiverr uses some variation of the “then you’ve come to the right place” opener. I’ll be honest, my eyes start to glaze over whenever I see those words on this site. If you could find something more arresting to put in that spot, it could serve you better. Something to keep in mind, perhaps, as you get more comfortable on Fiverr.
Offering unlimited revisions isn’t the wisest idea. It seems to attract, on average, more people who don’t know what they want.
Good luck.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 7:32 pm",2020-07-30 01:12:51.553317

I have noticed a new way to don’t get too much offers from buyers. As newbies send too much BR even if the request doesn’t meets their skills.
So, Now a days buyers are writing something like this: Don’t send offer, if you can’t do or I will report your account.
And when buyer write something like this, then the request lasts from around 1 hour or more. It means the newbies don’t send irrelevant offers to these types of requests.

I’m not sure it’s anything more than an empty threat, though. There are a limited number of things that one can report a random seller for. If the buyer goes hunting for those things, though, I can see how a good chunk could probably be fairly easily reported.
Basically, a seller has got to have a quality offer to call the buyer’s bluff, but if the seller is already good enough to avoid being reported, then the seller does qualify and thus wouldn’t be targeted for being reported anyway.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 9:31 am",2020-07-30 01:13:09.863692

What’s The Difference Between Response Time And Response Rate?
Response Rate is the percentage of first responses to new messages that a seller sends within 24 hours. Response Time is the average amount of time in hours that it takes for a seller to send a first response.
How Does The Response Rate Indicator Work?
It tracks the percentage of first responses sent within 24 hours over the last 60 days.
For example, if you received 10 new requests in your inbox in the last 60 days and replied to 9 of them within 24 hours of receiving each one, your response rate is 90%.
Note: if you reply to the last message more than 24 hours after receiving it, your response rate will still be 90%. We recommend that sellers reply even after 24 hours.
Is Every Inbox Message Factored Into My Response Rate?
The Response Rate Indicator tracks your first response to a new message. After that first reply, the rest of the conversation isn’t tracked, although it is important to continue conversations with Buyers until a conclusion is reached.",N/A,"Jun 18, 2018 6:38 am",2020-07-30 01:13:40.843073

Keep in mind that your percentage is affected by your responses on a “rollover basis” — that means that anyone you responded to 61 days ago, or longer, is no longer affecting your personal response percentage. Thus, it’s possible to lose response percentage without even having received a new message, because your ratio of non response to response was lowered because some of your “quick” responses may have moved outside of the 60 day window. I hope that makes sense and helps. As a side note, one thing that helps me is to check “unread” messages in my inbox when I have a large queue to respond to. This ensures I don’t miss any messages from down the line. I have achieved a 100% response rate, so I’m here to tell you it is possible if you remain diligent.

Regular",0,"I won’t say that it can’t happen, but I’d advise you read the entirety of the Terms of Service, so that you can more easily identify old/outdated information.
ToS:
Sellers must deliver completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Work button (located on the Order page) according to the service that was purchased and advertised on their Gig.
The Deliver Work button may not be abused by Sellers to circumvent Order guidelines described in this Terms of Service. Using the “Deliver Work” button when an Order was not fulfilled may result in a cancellation of that Order after review, affect the Seller’s rating and result in a warning to Seller.
Have you finished the client’s order and delivered it in the messaging system? That would be step one, doing your best to rectify the mistake. You said you’ve already reached out to CS, step two would be acknowledging and apologizing for the mistake.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 3:16 pm",2020-07-30 01:13:55.121838

My gig was receiving constant orders and reviews from the buyers but I was also facing a problem many times that buyers ordered a gig without contacting me first. So I made a little alteration in my gig pricing and after that …MY GIG IS GONE out of the search results … The same happened with 2 of my other gigs
Actually its some kind of rule here that once you make a change in your gig, it shall be reviewed by the Fiverr team before it gets back in the search results. I actually complained for 3 of my gigs in which one has been restored in the search result surprisingly in 2 days while others are left for a solution to be found yet.
The Covid 19 situation has further fictionalized the situation and it may take upto 10 days for a solution. All I would recommend is to reach out to the seller help and support and complain that your gig isn’t getting shown in the search results and most importantly afterwards… Have some patience",N/A,"Jul 10, 2020 9:52 am",2020-07-30 01:14:05.808819

please only those reply who appreciate and no criticism",N/A,N/A,N/A,mariashtelle1,6,"I would suggest to stop looking at other people and their gigs and how many times they were chosen but to concentrate on your own gigs and improving them or investing time in marketing or polishing your skills or learning new skills. Time that you spent monitoring other sellers is a totally wasted time.
