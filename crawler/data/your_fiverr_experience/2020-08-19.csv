He doesn’t have to suggest it. But did YOU tell him that it will cost extra?
How do you expect fiverr to “protect” you? It looks like you yourself offered to cancel the order. And it’s not fiverr job to hold your hand on communication issues.
When you are in those situations YOU have to communicate with your buyer to explain to them what was included in your order and the work that he is requesting will be extra x$ and send him a custom offer for that.
You can also attach a screenshot of the part that you can find below the requirements that says that buyer agreed that all additional work that’s not in the requirements might cost extra.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 5:57 am",2020-08-19 13:13:16.660127

I totally do, I’ve been freelancing for quite some years and those situations happen all the time and most of them easy solvable with proper communication from your side.
You need to define the scope.
You need to define what is revision.
You need write clear description what is and what is not included.
You need to remind client if they go out of the scope.
If you don’t want to listen an advise and still want to put responsibility on someone else and expect “platforms” to resolve communication issues then that’s also totally fine.

You could even reply to Buyer’s reviews if he would have left bad reviews just because you asked for extras ?
He might have threaten you to leave bad Reviews , and you could have reach to CS with tht screen shot ?
so there are lots of possibilities to save your self from this kind of situations, You worked and you deserved to be paid so never rely on cancellation rather choose to fight back !

Don’t you see a problem at buyer’s communication? He didn’t ask for additional work, he asked for a completely different piece. I cancelled the order because I don’t see a way to work with a buyer that don’t know what he needs and don’t appreciate the work that have already been done. I expect fiverr to protect workers from buyers that don’t know what they want.
I sell voice over services and that was happening to me very often. People were changing their mind after I deliver all the work done and asking a completely different thing compared with what they asked me first.
I solved this problem by putting the information at my GIGs description that all change to my end will cost extra and for the more distracted ones, I have that warning at my requirements as well, and if the person send me a message prior to the order I always discuss the project and I do my best to make clear to the buyer what’s included and what it’s not, even if I repeat myself or do a copy paste of my description.
Still, sometimes I get people trying to take advantage on me. I check if I was clear with my communication or I say no, sending an additional offer. Usually the buyer refuses and try to convince me to do it for free and then I send a screenshot explaining that I was very clear about it. Some of them understand and stop, others claim and ask an order cancelation and I simply refuse. When it’s my mistake and I gave space for a misunderstanding I accept and I do what the client is asking, but when I’m right and I know that I was very clear about it I don’t give them a chance.
It’s all about boundaries. Don’t let people take advantage on you. They will always try and, unfortunately, it’s part of your job to educate your customers.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 7:24 am",2020-08-19 13:13:22.442368

As a seller you have to retain control of the situation and communicate with the buyer, which is essentially what @mariashtelle1 is saying. Never be afraid to (politely) tell a buyer that they’ve received the service they paid for. It’s not your fault the buyer saw your concept as a work in progress. He paid for a design. He got a design. If he wants another one, he pays for another one.
Also, by offering or agreeing to a cancellation you are giving in which, as you’ve alluded to, will leave you feeling aggrieved. As @coerdelion said, in this situation accepting a cancellation probably wasn’t the right course of action for you.
A simple message to your buyer along the lines of “While I’m happy to continue working together, I do feel that I have fulfilled your original order. Although you now see this as a ‘work in progress’ please understand that for me each design is a unique order that takes around three hours to complete.” You could also add a couple of lines like “I’m sure you can appreciate that it is not reasonable to expect me to work for 6 hours on two original designs for $5. Can we please continue by placing a further order for a second design?”
None of that is meant to be a criticism of you, it’s just how I would handle the situation. I really do think that if your buyer was reasonable, they would understand. And even I they didn’t, you could have turned to customer support - demonstrating that you had fulfilled the order.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 9:15 am",2020-08-19 13:13:23.145838

The platform will protect you, if you are proactive and take steps to protect yourself.
Do you not first wrap up dishes and mugs before packing them in a box and moving them? A box can protect from dust, but not from bumps. If you don’t wrap them and they break, you can’t blame the box for not protecting them.

Okay! I have to apologize. I was just pissed of by the situation and not being able to protect myself. Sorry for saying all these negative things to you, you totally didn’t deserve any. I’ll remember your advice for the future as well. Sincerely sorry.
You have just earned my respect. Being humble enough to admit you were wrong is a good thing to see in any worker. Thank you for your admittance.

Tips for Sellers
For those of you who do not know me or those of you lurking the threads without logging on; take it from a buyer - know how to say “NO!” If you spend any time reading these forums, you’ll find plenty of posts where a seller, typically new - but not always, say they were scammed or the buyer is holding them hostage. They are literally begging forum members, to help them with a really bad scam artist, who is threatening them with bad reviews or giving them a sob story to get things for free.

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey,Your Fiverr Experience,3,14,7,"Aug 19, 2020 12:53 pm","Aug 19, 2020 12:56 pm","Aug 19, 2020 1:04 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/what-have-i-learned-in-my-11-months-of-fiverr-journey/503385,"ambujvats_17, drisyamol, patelhari, heyfellow1",ambujvats_17,4,"I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller.
A little about myself first-
I am a 27 yr old digital marketer and joined Fiverr last September. I’ve been jumping forth and back from New Seller to Level 1 (credit to the order completion rate). I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of my bills and I have gained good experience working with clients.
I want to mention one more thing that all my orders directly come from Fiverr search and I’ve never promoted my Gigs anywhere (except for a couple of times in my Twitter account which wasn’t of any help).
Now, getting to the purpose of this post.
What should you do to get more orders-
1. Don’t make the same Gigs which is already available by hundreds of other sellers.
The best example I could think of is web development, SEO, social media marketing etc.
Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying to not make Gigs in competitive niches. What I am saying is to find a “GAP”. What I mean by this is that your Gig should have a ‘freshness’ and ‘uniqueness’ in it.
So, how do you do it?
Think, be creative, explore Fiverr, write down what can be done differently, can you think of something that isn’t covered by other sellers or the quality of sellers are not good in any particular area or can you think of any micro-niche?
Let’s take my own example- Before making my “Product Research Gig”. I searched Fiverr for this term. After some time, I realized that there are many Gigs about product research but not about finding supplier details. So, I made this my Gig title, “I will find winning products for your store with supplier details”. Today, whatever I make, 70% of my income comes from this single Gig.
Example of a micro-niche-
Maybe don’t go for “I will build you a great website”. Go for “I will make you a Shopify website”. Even better is “I will make you a great beauty store in Shopify”.
Finally, do a lot of test and trial. Maybe you can find the winning Gig the first time or in the 20th time. But if you consistently think, test and try then you’ll get there.
2. The only goal you should have right now is to get a few good reviews in your Gigs.
Even if it means, getting underpaid. Don’t think about money for the first few orders. Do whatever is necessary and make the buyer happy. You might not like it but it is the first step to get consistent stream of orders.
3. Every level of sellers has its own buyer’s category.
Believe it or not, many people look for new sellers for their work. For example- When I was just starting out, I only get people who are pretty straightforward about their requirement and wanted the work to be done at a cheap price. Sometimes I wondered, I didn’t sign up for these menial works. I wanted good work and good money. But it’s a phase. As you advance, the quality of clients and money will increase.
4. Upload video in your Gigs.
Believe me, it will massively increase your click-through rate. You don’t have to hire someone. Just take out your phone, think about what you are offering and shoot up a 40-60 second video. I am massively shy when it comes to taking pictures let alone upload a minute-long video. But I did it and I am getting more clicks resulting in more orders than before.
5. Tip to turn an enquiry into order
Hone your listening skill. if you get an enquiry, read it twice maybe thrice and try to understand what the buyer want. If the buyer wants ‘A’ don’t push them for ‘B’. Don’t try to outsmart the buyer, understand him/her and type a straightforward response. “Yes, I can do that”.
After that, shoot up a question to the buyer. Once they answer, shoot up another one and maybe one after this. Make sure the questions are genuine. What will happen most of time is buyer will involve in a deep conversation with you. They will get a feeling that you are taking their project seriously (which you are) and they won’t take the trouble to explain all of this again to a different seller.
And you will close the deal with most of the inquiries. Not to mention, that you will get a much better understanding of the requirement resulting in fewer revisions and cancellation.
6. Getting good reviews

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey,Your Fiverr Experience,3,14,7,"Aug 19, 2020 12:53 pm","Aug 19, 2020 12:56 pm","Aug 19, 2020 1:04 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/what-have-i-learned-in-my-11-months-of-fiverr-journey/503385,"ambujvats_17, drisyamol, patelhari, heyfellow1",ambujvats_17,4,"I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller.
A little about myself first-
I am a 27 yr old digital marketer and joined Fiverr last September. I’ve been jumping forth and back from New Seller to Level 1 (credit to the order completion rate). I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of my bills and I have gained good experience working with clients.
I want to mention one more thing that all my orders directly come from Fiverr search and I’ve never promoted my Gigs anywhere (except for a couple of times in my Twitter account which wasn’t of any help).
Now, getting to the purpose of this post.
What should you do to get more orders-
1. Don’t make the same Gigs which is already available by hundreds of other sellers.
The best example I could think of is web development, SEO, social media marketing etc.
Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying to not make Gigs in competitive niches. What I am saying is to find a “GAP”. What I mean by this is that your Gig should have a ‘freshness’ and ‘uniqueness’ in it.
So, how do you do it?
Think, be creative, explore Fiverr, write down what can be done differently, can you think of something that isn’t covered by other sellers or the quality of sellers are not good in any particular area or can you think of any micro-niche?
Let’s take my own example- Before making my “Product Research Gig”. I searched Fiverr for this term. After some time, I realized that there are many Gigs about product research but not about finding supplier details. So, I made this my Gig title, “I will find winning products for your store with supplier details”. Today, whatever I make, 70% of my income comes from this single Gig.
Example of a micro-niche-
Maybe don’t go for “I will build you a great website”. Go for “I will make you a Shopify website”. Even better is “I will make you a great beauty store in Shopify”.
Finally, do a lot of test and trial. Maybe you can find the winning Gig the first time or in the 20th time. But if you consistently think, test and try then you’ll get there.
2. The only goal you should have right now is to get a few good reviews in your Gigs.
Even if it means, getting underpaid. Don’t think about money for the first few orders. Do whatever is necessary and make the buyer happy. You might not like it but it is the first step to get consistent stream of orders.
3. Every level of sellers has its own buyer’s category.
Believe it or not, many people look for new sellers for their work. For example- When I was just starting out, I only get people who are pretty straightforward about their requirement and wanted the work to be done at a cheap price. Sometimes I wondered, I didn’t sign up for these menial works. I wanted good work and good money. But it’s a phase. As you advance, the quality of clients and money will increase.
4. Upload video in your Gigs.
Believe me, it will massively increase your click-through rate. You don’t have to hire someone. Just take out your phone, think about what you are offering and shoot up a 40-60 second video. I am massively shy when it comes to taking pictures let alone upload a minute-long video. But I did it and I am getting more clicks resulting in more orders than before.
5. Tip to turn an enquiry into order
Hone your listening skill. if you get an enquiry, read it twice maybe thrice and try to understand what the buyer want. If the buyer wants ‘A’ don’t push them for ‘B’. Don’t try to outsmart the buyer, understand him/her and type a straightforward response. “Yes, I can do that”.
After that, shoot up a question to the buyer. Once they answer, shoot up another one and maybe one after this. Make sure the questions are genuine. What will happen most of time is buyer will involve in a deep conversation with you. They will get a feeling that you are taking their project seriously (which you are) and they won’t take the trouble to explain all of this again to a different seller.
And you will close the deal with most of the inquiries. Not to mention, that you will get a much better understanding of the requirement resulting in fewer revisions and cancellation.
6. Getting good reviews
No matter what, maintain the quality of your work. Nothing will work if you don’t provide top-notch service. Finally, once you submit the order. Always tell the buyer to contact you if they need any sort of revisions and you will be happy to do it. It will save you from the bad reviews.

Basically I think the process that Fiverr runs starts at a particular time and it probably takes hours to run, so different people will get their badges (or lose them) at different times.

I’ve been demoted to Level 1 after Evaluation it was just because of a client who was new to Fiverr and was too much inactive. I helped and explained everything, he submitted the requirements after 2 days of the order, moreover, he would reply after days and most the requests I made (Cancellation, Extending delivery time etc) were automatically expired because she would reply so late ;((
Disappointed that Fiverr system is all about buyers, we aren’t responsible for Buyers inactivity.",N/A,"Aug 15, 2020 5:08 am",2020-08-19 13:14:20.174674

So out of fear of getting an order cancelled I made the design for the cheap price the buyer wanted. But the buyer never replied to my questions for his design and I made one according to myself, and he didn’t like it and wanted to cancel order. I didn’t have time due to lined up orders, so I accepted it. My order completion fell to 98%. I have all requirements complete for level 2. I just want to make sure this fall in order completion won’t keep me from getting my level 2 badge.
Just so everybody knows, I’m still quite new. Its been just a little over 3 months I joined fiverr. So I’m not ver experienced. Looking for opinions from experienced sellers. Thanks!",N/A,"Aug 14, 2020 4:28 am",2020-08-19 13:14:20.521079

Looking for opinions from experienced sellers.
You don’t need opinions from experienced sellers, all you need to do is to read what’s written in your account.
But I’ll help you, it need to be over 90%.

Without a clear brief, how can any seller know what their buyer wants? You just took a guess, and the client didn’t like the result.
If a buyer doesn’t communicate - even after asking them for a brief, the best thing to do is to ask customer support to cancel the order. If you can clearly show that the client has not sent instructions, then CS can cancel an order without it affecting your stats. This is discretionary on their part though.
However, by blindly carrying on and guessing what the client wants you are simply wasting your time. In your case, the buyer eventually took control by requesting a cancellation. Had you instead taken control, you might have saved your stats.",N/A,"Aug 14, 2020 4:58 am",2020-08-19 13:14:21.859195

I just woke up to an email congratulating me on my new TopRated badge, this happened 2 months after I became Pro certified for translations.
I just wanted to tell all of the new sellers, and those that feel things are going a little slow:
Just keep at it, there are rough patches, I have had up to 2 months with no orders, but the hard work and patience really do pay off, and once you have proven that, Fiverr will actively step in to assist you to become even better.
This is really great news for me personally, but it also shows that even in crazy times such these, with everything that has happened in 2020, platforms like Fiverr prevail and are the future of business.
Big thank you to Fiverr and loads of love to the community, keep at it!!

Last month I had a miscommunication with a client and had to cancel an order. ever since then, I didn’t get any orders I knew the reason. but now in this evaluation, they took my badge.
Cancelation is a very huge problem for your gigs. Let this be a lesson for every new seller, you can avoid cancelation many ways but you cant understand a client’s mind.
Some of them don’t even know what they want and they don’t read your gig description and without even contacting you they place an order ( You can’t avoid this type of situations )
I hope those who read this may understand. I wish to get any help or suggestion form all.",N/A,"Aug 16, 2020 12:32 pm",2020-08-19 13:14:46.108160

The only thing fiverr does is provide you access to a market, and take care of the marketing aspect of things.

Cancelation is a very huge problem for your gigs. Let this be a lesson for every new seller, you can avoid cancelation many ways but you cant understand a client’s mind.

I think plenty of sellers sell/have sold pre-made products they created themselves (eg. documents), including TRS.
The “service” in this case (like many) would have surely been delivering what the buyer had asked/paid for.
humanissocial:
Just because other people getting away with breaking the ToS, that doesn’t justify you doing it.
Fiverr didn’t say that selling PLR goods was against the TOS (in the actual TOS or a policy page) or was
not one of the services allowed.
The fact that there were >1200 gigs selling PLR and those gigs were approved by Fiverr staff/moderators would surely have made the OP think they were allowed. If Fiverr approved those gigs and nothing is said against those types of services in the TOS or anywhere else by Fiverr, why shouldn’t he think they are allowed? If they aren’t allowed Fiverr shouldn’t have said “yes this gig is allowed” over 1200 times for that same service.
edit: If selling PLR is against their rules shouldn’t Fiverr have just added a new rule to their automated checks to check for “PLR” in the gig title and so made future checks of gigs a lot easier/quicker?
Disabling the account for something the OP didn’t know and wasn’t told and was led to believe was allowed (by what Fiverr did in approving 1200 gigs) is probably too much of a punishment really. Why not give a warning at most or just let them know that that it isn’t allowed if that’s the case?",N/A,"Aug 15, 2020 3:33 am",2020-08-19 13:15:10.188856

lol !
No.
You could ask your buyer for an extension, as the scope of their order is clearly different than what your gig offers.
You might just have to put in the cancel anyway. Without the files, you plain can’t do the work. And as @marinapomorac said: you can recover from a cancellation, but not from negative review, and that review will never go away.
It’s rough, I know, but you’re young and you have plenty of time to learn and recover from it.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 11:51 am",2020-08-19 13:15:21.382020

My order completion rate is about 95% average. But lately I had to cancel so many orders that this % is dropping a lot. I’m afraid to lose my level because of this.
Unfortunately these cancellations are just because buyers fault. why? Because they refuse to read my gig description/faqs/requirements or they read and just ignore it.
It is so frustrating to risk losing your level because abusive buyers simple don’t respect your gig conditions to get some work done.
I hope fiverr team change their mind about gig levels someday. It’s is frustrating to pay for someone else fault. And sellers have to deal with this every single day.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-19 13:15:50.988531

The problem stems from the buyer’s ability to order that many at one time (single order x14) and the gig timeline doesn’t increase to account for the additional word count to be edited.
This is why all of my gigs are set to more than 2 days. I had a real issue with this in the beginning, and decided the only way to relieve the pressure on myself was to increase how long it took me for cases such as this.
OP, my suggestion would be to bite the bullet and cancel the order. Explain to the buyer that you’re doing this because there is no way to complete such an order in the time frame requested. You may also gently suggest that, with such a large project, they reach out to sellers BEFORE ordering to ensure such work can be done in the timeframe they need it in. Let them know that this keeps them from having to reorder from sellers who cancel and losing the fee each time.
This is my opinion, but I hope whatever you do, it works out. Good luck!",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 11:09 am",2020-08-19 13:16:01.554719

If you have the wiggle room to cancel the order, I would. Given that Fiverr’s turnaround time to answer requests is currently more than 24 hours, the order would be considered late and the buyer could hit you with an automatic late delivery feedback. While you should still reach out to CS about the matter (maybe they’ll see that a request such as this in 24 hours is impossible), they may just help reset the completion rate. I don’t count on that but it is hit or miss.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 12:12 pm",2020-08-19 13:16:03.735866

The weather is hot during the day (around 27-30 degrees), and cold at night (it can be even 7 degrees). Baltic Sea is cold in general, and water temperature is 18-22 degrees, but it’s totally fine for me. It’s like going to Spain in October.
However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

First of all, it’s a part of my (and many other people’s) childhood .
It’s a very interesting and cautionary tale.
The story follows the experiences of a mongoose named Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (from his chattering vocalizations) after he becomes the pet of a British family residing in India. He becomes friendly with some of the other creatures inhabiting the garden and is warned of the cobras Nag and Nagaina, who are angered by the human family’s presence on their territory.

That’s so much more endearing to read than a post from someone who’s been here for five minutes and who writes “no sales but I’ve tried everything” - and they wonder why they’re failing.
It’s interesting that you use the term ‘agencies’. While there are genuine agencies who use Fiverr, in my experience the term ‘reseller’ is a better fit. While it’s unfair of me to say that all agencies are good, and all resellers are bad - in my experience there is a great deal of truth in this very broad statement.
I have found that resellers tend to have little grasp of their client’s brief, often fail to communicate effectively, tend to be pushy with deadlines, and want to pay the absolute minimum. Resellers are simply the middleman wanting to make as much money as quickly as possible with little regard for the end seller (you).
Of course, distinguishing between a good agency and a bad reseller can be very difficult, particularly because the Fiverr model allows people to buy a service without any communication exchange taking place to start with. However, over time you get to spot the telltale signs of ‘best price?’ and ‘need work done now’ and ‘client says work no good’ (when you know your own standards), etc.
Given all that, my one tip would be to avoid working with resellers. They cause you stress because they don’t understand their client’s brief, they often can’t communicate effectively in English, and they always push you on price and timescales.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 5:24 am",2020-08-19 13:19:21.654262

I paid them a decent amount.
This is relative. Some logo designers sell their logo services on Fiverr for $500 and beyond so what considers a decent amount?
From my research of the market, a large number of logo “designers” on Fiverr do not know anything about the design process. They have some basic skills in Photoshop, I’ll give them that but other than that - no, nothing.
It comes down to using online logo makers and then selling that as a custom logo. And in 3 out of 5 times I found in their delivery reviews logos from different companies just changed color.
I am amazed how most of them (buyers) not know how to use Google image search.
twolessthree:
I have no design training and I feel like I could have done the same thing.
I disagree with this. Sometimes the logo looks very simple and easy to create but behind that “easy” logo usually stands years of experience. If you are interested in the subject read about Paula Scher CITI logo.
The trick here is that, no, you could not do it yourself. If you could you wouldn’t hire a designer.
The full coverage behind the price of logo design includes sellers’ creativity and ingenuity.
Like @mariashtelle1 said, if you are OK with it, share the logo that was created and share please what did you respond to logo brief questions (what did designer had to work with for the development of logo).",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 12:06 pm",2020-08-19 13:19:28.348618

Thank you. I’ve always felt that no revisions (free or otherwise) policy is closing the door into the buyer’s face a little bit.

I tried this once and the person proceeded with requesting a new revision a few hours before order would autocomplete to drag it out to ensure her entire team and all the sponsors had enough time to review the delivery. The revision consisted of changing the price of the product because everyone involved couldn’t agree on it. The entire process took 11 days. It was a semi-regular but I ended up blocking her after that. I didn’t care to find out whether she misunderstood what I meant by 3 days or only pretended that she did.

This makes you a considerate seller. But have you considered not even mentioning revisions in your gig? My policy is very simple - I don’t mention revisions in my gig description, but if a buyer comes back to me with a reasonable request then I will sort it without any problems or bad feeling on my part. In other words, I’m happy to do reasonable revisions when politely asked to do so - I just don’t advertise it. I still get enough orders to keep me ticking along. Besides, we all know that buyers have the upper hand with CS when it comes to asking for revisions and cancellations.

I too have experienced this. It’s rare for me to have a holiday, but whenever I do I always put my gigs on hold one week before I’m due to depart - partly so I don’t have last minute orders, and partly so I can start to unwind and get in the holiday mood.
There was one memorable occasion three summers ago when I made the mistake of checking my email on the morning I was due to leave for the airport to go on holiday - and I saw a Fiver notification from a client who wanted some revisions. The stress that caused was horrible as the client’s order had autocompleted 10 days previously. I felt they had no right to come back to me 13 days after I had delivered their order - this was their first communication since. I ended up packing my laptop and taking it with me on holiday.

Yes, no one is perfect, but when a client makes sure that he tells you that he gave you less than 5 start because you took more than 5 minutes to answer is odd.

. But have you considered not even mentioning revisions in your gig?
This topic touches a huge nerve for me!! I mean HUGE!
I completely revised my requirements after the last straw! A buyer came back and said, “can I use my free revision for another take with this (almost completely different) script?” By the way, I made him place another order after gently explaining this is a new read because of the changes.
Sometimes I turn it around and ask the buyer what they would do, “this is a tricky situation. Since the changes are not my errors and it would require more time in the studio because of the change, to me it’s a new order. What would you do Dave? I will leave it up to you.” 9 out of 10 times they place a new order because they know in their heart it’s wrong to take advantage.
However, I always feel my blood boiling and steam fogging up my glasses!!!
You can take care of this “revision” issue in your requirements. I make every buyer agree to my terms and agree that they understand what a revision is! Some of you have seen this:

Nothing is FREE! Who started saying that on Fiverr??? You can’t walk into Walmart and say, “gee I’d like to have my free gallon of milk!”
It’s a business!
I recently had several people hang me up in revision mode and it says “late” in BIG RED LETTERS every time I log in! I hate that. I have no idea if that affects the algorithm but it would make sense. The only way around it is to send the same file over and over.

That’s totally true.
In a perspective of learning too, since you are also a voice over artist, may I ask you how would you handle a situation like this:
I had a situation where the buyer asked me to do a recording expressing an emotion. I made additional questions because it was a subjective one but he simply answered “do your best”, he was warned about the revisions (because I have a similar information at my requirements) and after delivery he asked me a free revision because he wanted me to express that emotion in a different way. Because I had to record again the entire script I asked an extra fee for the revision. I ended with a bad review.
What would be the best way to explain the situation to the buyer, in your perspective, to avoid a bad review?
melissaharlowvo:
I have no idea if that affects the algorithm but it would make sense. The only way around it is to send the same file over and over. Does anyone know if the ####LATE#### message affects anything (…)
I guess if affects the way your GIG will perform on search, because it’s related with the end result - if you delivered an order on time or not - but this is just my opinion. I’m not absolutely sure about that. If someone could provide additional information, that would be great.

The reason is simple, due to Covid a lot of people lost their jobs and many created Fiverr gigs.

There’s a lot more competition, with more and more people being on the site that means less sales for everyone and a lot of new sellers being in the front for exposure.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 11:12 am",2020-08-19 13:20:10.094876

Then, I checked out your gigs and I think you could improve it:
removing the unlimited revisions as it’s a fact that they attract scammers
removing your 24/7 online support. Check this out, too —> Top 5 Fiverr Myths - Debunked! 1
I also think that “6 months of support” is actually against ToS

Hi All,
I’m sorry to be posting another post on this forum, but your opinion is very crucial. Yesterday I had posted two images (thumbnails that I had designed) and asked which was better and which one I should put as my primary image on my GIG which is for designing thumbnails. Turns out, I was bored today and designed another one, now I can’t choose between the one I designed today and the one which was chosen yesteday by you guys. So I am attaching two more images, from which you can choose which one you think is best. Sorry again for posting again.
New one looks nice, but I’d still like to see the background flipped on the other one.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 11:39 am",2020-08-19 13:20:26.178621

Thanks and regards",N/A,N/A,N/A,jive_a_five,1,"Hey there! I don’t offer illustration services, but I do provide an excellent voiceover service!



I have many clients that put my voice to their whiteboards, animations and custom videos. I am the voice of multiple business presentations, educational videos and even a few video games!



http://fiverr.com/jive_a_five/provide-my-specialized-voiceover-talents-just



My voiceover is primarily North American male, but certain character voices can be applied.



I do have a voiceover reel that I can provide and some additional examples.



I have 100% ratings and a very satisfied client base with many repeat buyers.



While my gig video doesn’t really go much into my voiceover styles, I am very professional with a quick turnaround. I use professional grade gear to record and can provide audio effects, if required.



When you say “collaboration”, I get the impression that you have something else in mind, other than ordering a standard gig, so feel free to message me with any particular details and we can discuss further!



p.s. I also provide a rockin’ jingle service for audio (currently suspended for video/pricing updates) that can be incorporated for a number of creative uses. I can send over some audio demos too!



Either way, thanks for the post!

They want to make bank, obviously, but they don’t force anyone to buy or sell here, and, as urdeke pointed out, the fees are clear; when you sign up for an account, you’re supposed to have read and agree to the terms, and the fees are clearly stated. I’ll rather keep my personal “evil” label for other things.
I do agree that it seems a lot if you look at the percent of the low-value orders like $5. However, I see it this way: Fiverr has a theoretical/average overhead per order.
There are associated costs for Fiverr, like the general costs to operate Fiverr, transactional costs they have with their payment providers/gateways, etc., which are distributed throughout the orders/fees, and then there are additional costs that happen when something goes wrong with an order.
In this case, let’s say customer support needs to spend 1 hour on a $5 order vs. on a $100 order, or a $1000 order, it makes sense to me that the fee is higher (percent-wise) for low-value orders than high(er)-value orders. In addition to that, going from what you often read on the forum, it’s highly possible that, on average, low-value orders create more work for support than high-value orders.
It’s about the same reason that you’ll virtually be bullied out of some popular Parisian street cafés if you sit around for too long with just a cup of coffee, they either need/want several people per hour sitting at that same table with a cup of coffee each, or one person who buys a can of cocoa, a croissant and a petit-four during that hour - or to sell you a rather expensive coffee or cocoa … which they’d never even dream of doing … right?
It makes sense, too, I know how it is to be an entrepreneur and run a business, I won’t hang around a busy café in the city center with high rent for an unreasonably long time, or occupy a table in a busy restaurant and just drink a glass of water.
(disclaimer: the last paragraph was just to add a bit of fun, and I’ve never been bullied out of one of the great Parisian street cafés by one of the extremely polite and friendly garçons … or have I … )",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 3:10 am",2020-08-19 13:22:30.421654

Anyway I think they could pull a lot more customers from third world countries if they had a flat fee for their orders below $40. I assume a lot of people from the poorer countries would place $5 - $30 orders.

Cost of doing business for lower cost clients will equal out to higher cost buyers
Encourages people to buy higher cost gigs
It worked, because I don’t buy any gigs under $20 these days. Most of the time, I buy gigs priced at $40 & more.

May I repeat this once again: @gina_riley2 is correct, and you and and @jake_hopkins are wrong!
You can’t just use, let alone add, percentages in such a happy way.
To start with, the total amount of money from where Fiverr takes its share isn’t $5, but $7. YOU are paying $7 for the order, not $5. So $7 is the base from where you have to make your math.

No, they don’t. Once again, your math is incorrect. The fee is not part of the $5 cost. This is why a buyer pays $7 for a $5 gig. $5 gig + $2 fee = $7.
Fiverr is still earning only 20% of the gig cost, taken out of the seller’s earnings (i.e., $1, in the case of a $5 gig). The $2 buyer fee will be the same, on every order price up to $40.

Fiverr, is, does, and will always only keep only 20% of the total gig purchase cost from the seller’s earnings. Fiverr never keeps more than 20%. The seller always keeps the remaining 80%. I don’t understand why this concept is so hard to understand. Sellers agree to a profit-sharing model where Fiverr keeps 20% of the gig cost, and the buyer keeps the remaining 80%. This is a flat sharing model.
Every buyer pays an additional administration fee of $2 on every up-to $40 order price, and if the order price goes over $40, the buyer pays an added 5% of the cost.

Fiverr are most likely trying to encourage people away from peanut jobs as while they seem attractive, they encourage poor outcomes not only in terms on income but quality of work. This is mostly likely the greatest cause for negativity around the whole online freelancer thing.
Instead of scrimping and thinking how clever you are to get all that work done (often poorly) for $5, see how much better it would be to get better results if you invested $50.

Either use PayPal (no fees for me) or wait for a bunch of orders to finish approval before you withdraw.
The fee for direct deposit is $1, and that can now be negated since you get $4 instead.
Fiverr overall takes 42.857% of the money involved.
Math: 100 - [ ( 4 / 7 ) * 100 ] = 42.85714
If you make a ten dollar order (which is a lot more common honestly):
100 - [ ( 8 / 12 ) * 100 ] = 33.333…
Or fifteen:
100 - [ ( 12 / 17 ) * 100 ] = 29.41176
If you create a formula to find the percentage taken at large numbers (Including the 5% interest above $40):
lim_n 100 - { [ 4n / (( 5n + 2 ) + ( 0.5 * 5n ) ] * 100 }
Plug this in as the value n approaches infinity, and you find a trend:
lim_n-> inf = 23.80953

Frankly, from a business perspective, I can see 5r’s POV. By raising the admin/transaction fees, they are doing two things:
Cost of doing business for lower cost clients will equal out to higher cost buyers
Encourages people to buy higher cost gigs

Regular",1,"Okay, there is a difference in perceived value, numeric value, and utility value. If you’re using different terminology, then yes, you’ll be coming up with different numbers.
en.wikipedia.org
Value (economics)
In economics, economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. It is generally measured relative to units of currency, and the interpretation is therefore ""what is the maximum amount of money a specific actor is willing and able to pay for the good or service""? Among the competing schools of economic theory there are differing theories of value. Economic value is not the same as market price, nor is economic value the same thing as market value. If ...
en.wikipedia.org
Utility
Within economics, the concept of utility is used to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a consumer's preference ordering over a choice set....
If you use the numeric value, then the [total cost to the buyer] is $7, for which Fiverr gets $3 and the Seller gets $4.
From a Seller perspective, I always get 80% of my listed price. Always. What Fiverr gets is Fiverr’s business (figuratively and literally). What the buyer pays is completely dependent on their (objective?subjective?) perspective of “is the total input (cost) worth the output?”, which is my business. But it’s also my business to make sure my product/service is worth that total cost.
Now, that “value”, I can understand why a buyer might be upset.
From a buyer perspective, I’m getting short-changed. The ‘total’ value doesn’t match the ‘perceived’ value.
Huh.
There might be a bit of a valid point in this.

I deleted all my gigs and started from scratch,"Your Fiverr Experience

I had read of the dangers of taking this route but I felt I needed to. So, this is me sharing my experience in case there is someone out there wondering if they should recreate their gigs or just keep editing them.
When I joined Fiverr as a seller, I wasn’t sure which services to offer so I started of as a jack of all trades. But after a while, I quickly niched down and edited my old gigs to represent that. The only problem was I now had gig URLS that told a totally different story from the gig description. And that bothered me so much that I decided to recreate them.
I was on pins and needles because I didn’t know how this experiment would turn out. But after a couple of months, I have no regrets. Here is what I have learned so far from the experiment;
I am getting almost the same number of impressions but at least I am getting the right traffic
My income has improved. But I think this is because I raised my rates.
I am no longer attracting requests from random clients who are not interested in the services I am offering.
I have no way of proving this but I suspect my conversions would be better if I had more reviews
*I had to depend on returning clients at first before my new gigs started ranking again. I also had to let go of some old clients in order to focus on one niche.
So I guess it is safe to say that deleting your gigs to recreate them can be a good thing. But only do this if you really need to change the gig URL. Also, do your own cost-benefit analysis because it could potentially affect your sales",N/A,1,"Aug 19, 2020 9:11 am",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-19 13:23:06.739545

Have you been sending finished work via messages? You should only ever send finished work with the deliver option. As someone else said, if the buyer wants any changes then they can request a revision. There’s no reason to put yourself at risk of delivering late.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 7:35 am",2020-08-19 13:23:29.245210

I’m not saying this particular one is trying to scam you, just that you’re making it very easy for people to do.
Deliver the work with the deliver button. Revisions exist for a reason - you’ll just have to accept that this particular order is going to be marked as a late delivery.
On that note, I recommend you stop offering unlimited revisions. All that does is attract bad buyers.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 7:41 am",2020-08-19 13:23:30.627823

As for delivering up to four hours late not affecting your stats, that is a load of rubbish. One second late and it will be recorded as a late delivery.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 8:41 am",2020-08-19 13:23:30.956718
