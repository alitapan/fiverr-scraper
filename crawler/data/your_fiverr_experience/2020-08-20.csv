I paid them a decent amount.
This is relative. Some logo designers sell their logo services on Fiverr for $500 and beyond so what considers a decent amount?
From my research of the market, a large number of logo “designers” on Fiverr do not know anything about the design process. They have some basic skills in Photoshop, I’ll give them that but other than that - no, nothing.
It comes down to using online logo makers and then selling that as a custom logo. And in 3 out of 5 times I found in their delivery reviews logos from different companies just changed color.
I am amazed how most of them (buyers) not know how to use Google image search.
twolessthree:
I have no design training and I feel like I could have done the same thing.
I disagree with this. Sometimes the logo looks very simple and easy to create but behind that “easy” logo usually stands years of experience. If you are interested in the subject read about Paula Scher CITI logo.
The trick here is that, no, you could not do it yourself. If you could you wouldn’t hire a designer.
The full coverage behind the price of logo design includes sellers’ creativity and ingenuity.
Like @mariashtelle1 said, if you are OK with it, share the logo that was created and share please what did you respond to logo brief questions (what did designer had to work with for the development of logo).",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 12:06 pm",2020-08-20 18:49:29.615866

So I can appreciate your skepticism about “I can do better” because experts are supposed to be able to make it look easy When I said a decent amount, I mean that I was paying 3x their basic price.
But anyway I appreciate you being willing to give it a more expert eye and tell me if I’m being unreasonable.
First of all, I contacted them and described the idea before I ordered, they said they could do it. So I ordered and sent a detailed description of what I wanted. Then they sent me something that ignored 90% of my requirements and just did random stuff. So I thought maybe there’s a language barrier and I had to spend time to draw this to show my idea:

The first image you shared is the image you sent them? You created that as guideline for them?
The second image they sent you as logo looks good comparing to the idea what you drawn, but if it was me (and this is just me keep in mind I am in no way something extra special out there, just normal above average designer) I would modify letters from typography point of view, it would not be a standard font any more but twigged a little.
And depending on what you paid I think you should get some revisions that are not extreme (size of @ and similar).
Portfolio shows Minimalistic logo design while yours is typography mixed with minor special icons.
From creative point of view, there is not much to develop from your guideline image.
Maybe try a different font, change snake head, troll head, make @ different, but that is all done in revisions.
There is nothing else to create from your guideline image.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 7:14 am",2020-08-20 18:49:31.155143

I’d ask the person to make all the 3 illustrated parts in the same style (and use the same stroke thickness while they’re at it if they choose to go with the line art). It should bring it more together.
Fiverr doesn’t allow partial refunds. Packages often mean that different files are included. Or more options. Or quiker delivery. It doesn’t automatically mean that you’re getting less effort if you purchase Basic or more effort if you’re purchasing Standard or Premium.

Even if, I gotta say, I feel like some unfair assumptions are being made about me and I’m feeling a bit berated.
That said, I did ask my initial question in good faith because I didn’t know if I just had the wrong perspective, and it seems I stand corrected. I really do appreciate everyone giving their more experienced point of view. I’ll accept what I’ve been given and refrain from leaving a review.
In my defense, if any of you happen to be interested in it, my choice in picking him was because of the simple stylistic animals in many of his designs. I just expected that the small parts that were illustrated would match the style.
I contacted the designer ahead of time and described my idea, and basically said I wanted 3 of the letters to have stylistic creatures like he has done, and he said enthusiastically he could do it (I contacted 2 others and the others did, in fact, inform me it was not something they wanted to do). So I feel justified in asking for something different, but again, there may have been a language comprehension issue with the initial request.
And no, I did not have any grandiose ideas of intricate intertwining animals, I specifically requested only a few letters and only part of the letters be stylized.
@marinapomorac if you don’t mind me asking, what do you mean by tweaking the letters? I’m not asking for free work! Just a better idea. I do know my way around photoshop and maybe it’s small things I could do. And can you give me an example of an online logo maker?

It is like you want to boil water by putting it into the freezer.
Completely wrong.
The logo must be made in a vector program. You can use Photoshop for sketch if you like that, but when you have approximate design ready, you do it in vector and vector only.
Second, I hope you did not get my remarks wrong here. I fully understand your situation. I was a buyer for a long time, and it is quite frustrating to spend two hours of conversation before order to make sure he gets you only to realize he can’t draw a straight line in vector even if his life depends on it.
In this case, the seller did the best he could with the given data.
Now the next steps highly depend on how much you paid him and how much he is willing not to leave a job undone for no extra fee and you to explain what you do not like about the logo.
You should always give constructive criticism. Meaning you need to explain either what you think is wrong or how you would prefer it.
Look at that this way. My client wants a logo to have glasses. I showed him five typical styles. Doesn’t like. I showed him 100 different. Doesn’t like. I gave him all humanly possible vector icon glasses available under the Sun. Doesn’t like any of them.
I wasted half my day that no one is going to give me back. I had no idea he is going to refuse infinite glasses.
Point? He doesn’t know what he wants; therefore, nothing I can draw will work.
Regarding logo makers, Google Online logo makers.
You have at least two pages of choices. Some are automatic. Some give you the option to select and work on the design.
And regarding your logo, I do not know where you are planning on using it since for YouTube art is too small to be noticeable. For app or social media - well, you have nothing that can be translated into an icon.
I just have no idea what you want to convey with the logo. Maybe combine first letters into icon/logo and text to be under and used on larger surfaces… I do not know. Plus, he used paid font to create your logo. If you open it in Photoshop and you do not have that font, it will change letters unless he converted them in the object.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 4:41 pm",2020-08-20 18:49:34.326656

The Brief is vague or just poor design. Other designers declined as they saw this and dodged. Sorry, that is not meant to offend you - even tho I understand it is upsetting to hear. You asked and this is real help.
This designer seems less skilled and took it on. The result they returned is indeed a vastly tidyier version of the concept which now actually reads “NetHack” as opposed to “NetWack”. Sure it looks nothing like the formula portfolio work but nor does your brief.
I think that from your admission in the OP, you didn’t invest enough in this. Neither in $$ nor your own time. Branding is not done from liking a few pics (esp as seemingly random as these) but understanding the nature of the business and the message they want to send to certain people. That means a lot of investment in talking & thinking. Here is one I did for a friend for a “pathetic” $150
I will put each round of designs in a post. Sadly the discussion is not so easy to share

One possible solution can be to contact the support and explain to them your situation.You can ask them to cancel the order in that way your order completion rate will not go down.
This indeed works, but the things you say as a seller should be valid. for an example as you said in this scenario, once they (cs) read the conversation between you and the buyer, they should realize that you delivered what you promised and the problem is totally from the buyers end. In that case definitely they will make the refund without affecting your order completion rating or just close the resolution by completing the order by themselves.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 3:54 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:18.078833

We read a lot in the forums from sellers who say CS sided with the buyer. However, I have noticed that many (but not all) of the sellers who then tell their story in the forums really do struggle with telling it with any brevity, impartiality, or indeed clear language.
In these cases I suspect that the seller isn’t as innocent as they make out. If their post in the forum is rambling and contains errors, then their work for the buyer was likely to be the same (which led to the complaint), and then their complaint to CS is likely to be just as bad.
If a seller has a fair complaint against a buyer, and can explain that succinctly to CS, then I have every confidence that CS will be fair and impartial in reaching a decision.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 3:33 am",2020-08-20 18:50:20.597206

Why are you connecting how well the sellers speaks English with the CS response or the client satisfaction.
I see your point, but I would agree with @english_voice on this one.
It’s been almost 2 years that I read complains from sellers on this forum and oh boy, most of them is so hard to understand because of bad English. And if we can understand it with our collective mind then most likely one CS agent (who also have KOI’s on how fast they resolve the issue) wouldn’t spend 10 days trying to understand what they are saying and what’s the issue. And that reduces their chances of resolution in sellers favour.
The same with clients. If you don’t understand your client or client can’t understand you then also most likely you will deliver something different from what client asked.

To be clear this is absolutely 100% NOT about race or country of origin. Totally not. It is simply about having the ability to clearly communicate in English.

If you look, you will see we have lots of these posts ever day. Tell me how to succeed??? The first thing is to work out how to succeed yourself. There are no simple formulas - even if some ra ra guy tells you there is for a low, low $39.95 if you buy his book (and I wrote one such book).
Great people are looking for something special - and will pay. Average people are looking for something barely there average - commonly for a barely there fee. Who do you want your customers to be? Who are you?
The point here is that you need to lead your customers. If your wording is poor, your images are average you will not stand out. If your pricing is bottom of the barrel you are immediately left scrabbling with everyone else doing the very same thing.
Show a buyer who you really are. Be that so powerfully that the right people - the ones who resonate with you - want to follow. It doesn’t immediately become easy as people will tell you that you are wrong and silly, but look at what they do and I bet you it is virtually nothing and they are simply scared of doing what you are doing themselves.
My suggestions:
Revise at your wording. Hire a writer with sales experience if necessary. Even tho you sell Logos, the way your words come across, represents you the person (just as these words I write represent me in all my odd manner).
Put aside these blurry images (or at least size them for how Fiverr will display them). Make some logos that are unique - uniquely you. Stand out. Far better to be noticed and remembered as The Specialist in Logos made of Severed Body Parts (or something equally fun) than forgotten as just another person with formula forgettableness.
I wouldn’t buy a business service like Branding from anyone who didn’t make it clear that they were going to understand what my business was and who the ideal customers we need to attract are. Branding that doesn’t start with some serious conversation and research is not branding at all. However, understand that many 2-cent operators won’t want to have that conversation so like #1 above, know who you and your (good) clients are.
Chin up, all of these Freelance sites are very hard places to get started. Get a strong direction and at least you stand out. That is a start. See if you have opportunities n the real world too.",N/A,"Aug 19, 2020 6:27 pm",2020-08-20 18:50:38.986315

So I continued to dig and found more Fiverr seller artists who’s cover image might be stolen, but all other images appear to be theirs.

Should I bother with them seeing as the medium is different to that of traditional or digital art? Or is it none of my business? Last time I talked about something like this I was accused of being jealous of the person’s success.
Seeing as some gig sellers just steal images and upload it and resell it, those I agree 100% should be reported, but what about sellers that DO deliver their own artwork but the advertising is false?

As a long-time seller here on Fiverr, I can guarantee you that it is not rubbish. Gigs DO rotate in the search results, and new sellers are given a short boost on the top pages to get them started.

Perhaps there are fewer people looking for this service right now. Or, perhaps your competitors are gobbling up the requests in this area before they make it to your BR list.
Fiverr does not guarantee that you will have orders or buyer requests. That’s not how Fiverr works. You are responsible for connecting to your target customers, and convincing them to hire you. If you can’t find the kind of buyers you want here, on Fiverr, then now might be a good time to figure out where else those customers can be found, and bringing them here, to your gigs.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 4:44 pm",2020-08-20 18:51:13.011638

So when did they bring this policy of rotation ?
It’s be in operation for years. It is not a new policy.
mercurianus:
You need to be clear as to when they have been doing this?
No, I don’t, because this is not knowledge that will make you a better seller.
mercurianus:
If so why the gigs never rotated for so many months?
Everyone’s gigs are constantly rotating in the search system. There is no set time for any rotation. The system is always working, and prioritizing gigs according to its internal coding.
mercurianus:
All I know is the algorithm isn’t consistent.
The algorithm IS constant, and it applies equally to everyone. Just because it isn’t working for you, in the way that you want it to, does not mean anything is broken or inconsistent.
mercurianus:
I can’t accept the algorithm is absolutely fine.
That is your choice, however, the search system is what it is. It’s not going to change because you think it needs to feature you in a better way. Good sellers learn to work within the system, and do whatever THEY have the ability to do, in order to improve their success and business prospects. Expecting the search system to provide all of your orders, while you sit back and wait for things to happen, is not how business – even here on Fiverr – works.

That was a rare thing. Otherwise they’re pretty good about communicating status of your video upload.
But my guess is that there may be an issue with your video and they just haven’t told you. It could also be just slow because they’re so busy.
In any case, no moderator for the forum can access the backend of Fiverr to help you and Fiverr CS don’t look at the forum to help people with queries.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 3:14 pm",2020-08-20 18:52:14.247711

You still have a 4.7 star average shown on your profile (all time average), but after the 1 star reviews was it less than 4.7 average on your analytics page? The analytics page only checks the last 60 days.
If it was less than 4.7 stars on your analytics page (60 day average) that’s why you lost the level.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2020 3:17 pm",2020-08-20 18:52:47.752623

looks like you didn’t check how fiverr works
if your buyer placed an order it means that they already paid for your services and you have a green banner on top of your screen that the order will be autocompleted in 3 days.

please enlighten me.
First of all, it’s a part of my (and many other people’s) childhood .
It’s a very interesting and cautionary tale.
The story follows the experiences of a mongoose named Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (from his chattering vocalizations) after he becomes the pet of a British family residing in India. He becomes friendly with some of the other creatures inhabiting the garden and is warned of the cobras Nag and Nagaina, who are angered by the human family’s presence on their territory.

I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller.
