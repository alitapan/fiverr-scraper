I am a relatively new seller and I have been facing a strange problem. Initially I scored a few orders from here and there and after getting a few reviews my profile sky rocketed and I got a lot of traffic on my video editing gig. When I checked the graph I saw that I was having over 2000 impressions in a day. It was more work than I could handle so I had to refuse some clients from taking their work. After a few days my impressions dropped to just 15. From 2000 to 15 that’s a very big jump and I have not been getting much. Now I only receive orders from my permanent clients and am not getting any new messages.

I am a relatively new seller and I have been facing a strange problem. Initially I scored a few orders from here and there and after getting a few reviews my profile sky rocketed and I got a lot of traffic on my video editing gig. When I checked the graph I saw that I was having over 2000 impressions in a day. It was more work than I could handle so I had to refuse some clients from taking their work. After a few days my impressions dropped to just 15. From 2000 to 15 that’s a very big jump and I have not been getting much. Now I only receive orders from my permanent clients and am not getting any new messages.

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey
Fiverr Stories
I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller. A little about myself first- I am a 27 yr old digital marketer and joined Fiverr last September. I’ve been jumping forth and back from New Seller to Level 1 (credit to the order completion rate). I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of…

I have had some degree of success on Fiverr in the past year. Largely, my services consist of social media, website content and websites. This particular client approached me asking for help with his website. I determined that he needed content because he had none. It was a real estate site. I provided him with consultation as to what I believed he needed to meet his goals and then he contracted me to write 13 pieces of content for his site in the form of articles. These were to be completed within 2 weeks. I usually allot myself plenty of time to finish work so as to allow for any unforeseen things that may consume time. This particular job was finished in less than 2 weeks.
My client wanted to pay half up front and the rest on completion using the milestone feature. I agreed and ended up providing him 3 of the 13 articles to get started with that–he indicated he loved them and requested minor revisions. I continued working over the next few days until we were 2 articles short of completion. This was when he messaged saying he no longer needed the content. I let him know that I was nearly finished with his job and that if he wanted to cancel, he would have to do that on his end and he would have until the last day to do it. I let the work sit for approximately another 5 days after that and heard nothing from the client.
On the last day, I decided since I hadn’t heard from him and he had not cancelled anything, I would go ahead and deliver the completed work in order to try and get paid–after all, he had 5 days to cancel this order and I got no response from him on it even though I reached out to him twice during that 5 days and was ignored…so on delivery (and this was a $300 job) the client comes back saying he isn’t going to pay and that he’s going to dispute and all sorts of things.
I realize that I took a gamble when I let him run down the fiverr clock on delivery and then delivered but what about the fact that I was more than halfway finished with his work and had put time into it and so on up to that point?

I’m really sorry this has happened to you, but I just want to point out that you must screenshot these articles on his website immediately and send it to CS. Then explain what happened.
If you have proof that they are using your work for free, that’s the best way to show CS that you were scammed and they may do something about the refund (I’m not sure if they will contact the buyer about the stolen work, I hope they get banned when they do that…).

It’s sad but many sellers face this type of issue from time to time. I personally have never faced such a situation though. If the buyer’s website still has your articles published(whose copyright you own) then you can file DMCA(Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown request. There are several sites that will do that for your little as 10 usd or you can send a request yourself . You will have to do a bit of research on how to file. Filling a DMCA will take this site down.
You can inform the buyer that if they use your content without paying, you are going to file a DMCA takedown. If he agrees to pay then it’s well and good, otherwise you are left with no option but to fill a DMCA takedown request.
Hope it helps

I provided him with consultation as to what I believed he needed to meet his goals and then he contracted me to write 13 pieces of content for his site in the form of articles. These were to be completed within 2 weeks. I usually allot myself plenty of time to finish work so as to allow for any unforeseen things that may consume time. This particular job was finished in less than 2 weeks.
My client wanted to pay half up front and the rest on completion using the milestone feature. I agreed and ended up providing him 3 of the 13 articles to get started with that–he indicated he loved them and requested minor revisions. I continued working over the next few days until we were 2 articles short of completion. This was when he messaged saying he no longer needed the content. I let him know that I was nearly finished with his job and that if he wanted to cancel, he would have to do that on his end and he would have until the last day to do it. I let the work sit for approximately another 5 days after that and heard nothing from the client.
On the last day, I decided since I hadn’t heard from him and he had not cancelled anything, I would go ahead and deliver the completed work in order to try and get paid–after all, he had 5 days to cancel this order and I got no response from him on it even though I reached out to him twice during that 5 days and was ignored…so on delivery (and this was a $300 job) the client comes back saying he isn’t going to pay and that he’s going to dispute and all sorts of things.
I realize that I took a gamble when I let him run down the fiverr clock on delivery and then delivered but what about the fact that I was more than halfway finished with his work and had put time into it and so on up to that point? What about the fact that he ordered a gig that stipulated 1 revision and no refunds?

I’m Level 2, more or less close to meeting the requirements for a top rated seller.
They auto-selected my best selling gig as the one to be promoted.
As far as I can see, you need to bid against all the other eligible sellers in your category to “win” the ad-sponsored spot:
“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”
They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems. This would probably mean that sellers in smaller niches would be rewarded by lower fees while oversaturated categories would probably cost more since more sellers would be able to bid.",N/A,N/A,N/A,logo_influence,2,"You are lucky to got that feature.

I’ve signed up one, so we’ll see how it goes. We also didn’t get our $10 ‘gift’ - I clicked the link for it, but nothing was applied to our account. Maybe a glitch in the matrix. I’m not going to lose sleep over it, but annoying.

They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems.
Just be careful with this - my understanding is that the recommended amount is your bid amount, not your daily spend. My recommended bid for example is $0.34, and my daily cap is $5. So I can ‘afford’ about 15 clicks per day, which is the amount I’m willing to test with, until I see if this generates results.

My opinion:
Give new sellers A, B, C, D and E chance to promote. They use promote and get (maybe +) orders.
After a week give new set of sellers chance to promote. But cancel the ability to promote to the last batch of sellers. They got their chance to get clients.
But, the only problem is that Fiverr is already working on that concept with gig rotation, the issue is that rotation is not working for a long period of time. Or it is rotating really slow.",N/A,"Sep 7, 2020 7:25 am",2020-09-09 21:23:17.084851

What I am curious about though, what happens if your account gets banned or you stop working alltogether on fiverr right after using the sponsored ads and being charged for them?

As far as I can see, you need to bid against all the other eligible sellers in your category to “win” the ad-sponsored spot:
“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”
They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems.

I already use it, and i conquest one good order spend the gift of $10… but now i faced something strange: I insert $1,00 to won all auction (so no matter the cust per click i’ll won)
But now i faced that i’m paying $0.51 per click, but the Fiverr recommend in my category the value $0.38…
So the question is: If the recommendation is $0.38, why i’m paying $0.51 in auction?
I need watch this more closest… check regulary how much i’m paying per click and adjust by the recommentadion of the category.
Another something to pay attention is how many clicks are you receiving… for example in the beginning with the $10 of gift i received 50 clicks… but the price per click will increase with time, so in the end maybe i’ll start to pay like $25 per 50 clicks",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/e/4/5/e45ad601af0efc326cdc887584938b13af8bfdb8.png,"Sep 7, 2020 10:00 am",2020-09-09 21:23:24.097090

So the question is: If the recommendation is $0.38, why i’m paying $0.51 in auction?
Somebody else (the 2nd top bidder?) probably bid $0.51 (or $0.50?). You won the bid with your $1.00 bid so maybe you pay the bid of the 2nd top bidder (or maybe $0.01 more than it?).
Promoted Gigs are based on a “Second Price Auction” process, which means that while the Gig with highest Ad rank wins, the price that is charged from the Seller upon click on his ad equals to the minimum bid necessary for the Seller to maintain their winning position in the auction (which is determined in relation to all other bidders). In other words, Sellers may pay less than their actual bids.",N/A,"Sep 7, 2020 10:17 am",2020-09-09 21:23:24.509444

So seller A is on top, max bid 0,52$

I did get 2 or 3 buyers that have returned to my inbox to ask for custom offers. However, Fiverr charged me the $.28 fee for each of those orders too. So, it appears that if you get a buyer through the promo, that you pay Fiverr the fee for every gig the buyer orders after that.
All of the orders were ten dollar orders, which I usually would pay the standard 20% to Fiverr. However, I am now being charged the 20% plus the $.28 fee per order. That means I am paying 23% to Fiverr on a $10 order instead of only 20%.
I even had one buyer order three ten dollar orders that cost me an additional $.84 total for the three orders, where if the buyer had placed one 30 order, I would have only paid .28.
In summary, the promo is better if the buyer places larger orders and not smaller orders. Plus, expect to give Fiverr the price you bid on every order placed by a seller who found you through the promotion.",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/0/2/9/029f64582543dc7ac5606e378e0f4a5b9cfb4978.png,"Sep 7, 2020 8:44 pm",2020-09-09 21:23:39.321763

No upfront payments. Instead, your Fiverr Balance will be charged retroactively each month for your ads’ activity of the previous month.
So next month you can use the $10 promo to get the amount deducted from your monthly bill.
There you go. The $10 will most likely be available next month when they deduct the costs from your balance.

As far as I can see, you need to bid against all the other eligible sellers in your category to “win” the ad-sponsored spot:
“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”

“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”
They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems. This would probably mean that sellers in smaller niches would be rewarded by lower fees while oversaturated categories would probably cost more since more sellers would be able to bid.",N/A,N/A,N/A,janali,2,"Please let us know if you received a response, I’m curious to hear what they’ll say!",N/A,"Sep 8, 2020 9:25 am",2020-09-09 21:23:51.501871

I will. Here is the note I sent to CS. The buyer ordered from me two times through my inbox and I made him custom offers on a gig I had not promoted. The third time he also came to me through my inbox and made a request for a gig I was promoting. When I made him an offer on that gig and he accepted it. Then when I went the dashboard, I noticed his order had a “promoted” sign on it.

Plus, with everyone who pays for clicks being moved to the front of the search pages, I would think the others of us who do not are pushed back.

I just checked on that seller. The seller is now are on page 8, but has 8 orders. I was just thinking that having a lot of orders is good, but if you have to pay Fiverr a higher % for every order they place later on, then maybe I do not like that.

if you have to pay Fiverr a higher % for every order
I guess it depends on the profit you make overall through the promotion that you wouldn’t make without it. Then again, this isn’t supposed to happen at all, you’re not supposed to be charged for every order, especially not more than once on each client.

They mention the order being a bit late…
Yeah I initially thought the promotion was a good idea but then I realized that I still have 3 books to work on this week and don’t even really have time for additional orders.
To me personally, the promotion feature is a two-edged sword, either it could potentially help you over slump periods or it can mess with you if you bite off more than you can chew and then you might get negative reviews because you can’t keep up.",N/A,"Sep 8, 2020 10:34 am",2020-09-09 21:23:54.643091

As far as I can see, you need to bid against all the other eligible sellers in your category to “win” the ad-sponsored spot:
“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”
They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems. This would probably mean that sellers in smaller niches would be rewarded by lower fees while oversaturated categories would probably cost more since more sellers would be able to bid.",N/A,N/A,N/A,designs_4u1,0,"No AD found into the first page

This is not the first time Fiverr test their gig promotio feature. They did it few years ago. At that time, i was also chosen to be one of tester. I placed the bid,i saw my gig on first page randomly ( with ad sign ), got impression and also got few orders. It seems to works well but then Fiverr stop testing.

If that’s true the help page is very misleading by saying it should show “AD” or “Promoted”.
And it’s sort of misleading to buyers too if they don’t know a particular gig in the search is actually there because it’s a promoted one (Google purposely show normal results and promoted ones separately). I wonder if there’s some legal/ethical reason for it. eg. like the paid reviews isn’t allowed but now gigs can be paid to be at the top of some search results but if it’s without the buyer knowing it’s promoted it’s not really ethical.

As far as I can see, you need to bid against all the other eligible sellers in your category to “win” the ad-sponsored spot:
“A bid is a maximum amount you’d be willing to pay per click on your ad. The higher the bid, the higher the chances to win your ad spot. However, you’ll pay just the minimum to win over other bids. You can adjust your bid from your Promoted Gigs dashboard later.”
They also set a “recommended amount” per day for you. For me it’s $0.66 per day based on my category it seems. This would probably mean that sellers in smaller niches would be rewarded by lower fees while oversaturated categories would probably cost more since more sellers would be able to bid.",N/A,N/A,N/A,uk1000,0,"There is a bit of code in the gig page that says as some sort of tootip

In the information link someone provided, it said only specific people can see the ad. So probably other sellers aren’t eligible to view them, which would be good in my opinion.
This new ad system might be the reason all top rated gigs have vanished from first page in all categories I checked, and even when sorting by best selling they’re not there. So basically sort by new, recommended or best selling gives the exact same results haha (Only gigs with a couple of reviews).

Been there done that, I think we all have.
They usually say “You’re too expensive but you have good review ( better reviews than cheap sellers) so I want you to work on my translation, but since there are many cheaper sellers, that must mean you’re simply charging too much and therefore you should lower your price.” OK, well, they don’t actually say it like that, but that’s what they are trying to say.
True, my rates are quite high, and there ARE very skilled sellers who charge much lower. However I charge that amount for a reason ( 20% being taken away being a big one), and buyers are paying for my skills and the guarantee that I am no Google translator.
Sometimes when I feel like it, I will mention what I typed above to the buyers, and in some cases they get it. In other cases, they go back to the “But you so expensive, please give me your best/lowest price, but be sure to give me the best quality translation.”

But I can’t be doing with games like that now.
I am the same. I see haggling as a huge red flag that they will be a pain to work with. I do not work with buyers like that. Either you pay the price or you don’t.
I have made an exception to take 10% of the price once because a buyer said that he would give me more days to complete the project in exchange for his price reduction. Negotiating should not just be about one side gaining the advantage, but about securing a beneficial agreement for both parties. Buyers on Fiverr generally do not understand this, though, so that is why I usually refuse to negotiate with them.

My point is that I’m not prepared, or even bothered, to explain the value I bring for $50 vs someone who charges $20. It’s just not worth my time or the hassle, as they’ve already demonstrated they’re a very bad person to work with.
As it happens, their job would probably have taken me 1.5 to 2 hours to complete to my standard. I don’t know of any native English writer / proofreader who will spend up to 2 hours working for $20.
The funny thing is that the job was proofreading some sales literature and website copy for an overseas based English language school. Based on the sample they sent me, they need a miracle - not a proofreader.
And although I’m trying to be witty with my last paragraph, there is also some truth in it. You get what you pay for. I suspect the language school will end up hiring someone for $20 and they’ll get $20 worth of work in return. They’ll then publish the result on their website - and then wonder why people reading it are thinking it’s complete nonsense.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 1:39 pm",2020-09-09 21:24:28.188660

Then I do not understand. oOO is not to be used for this purpose. For that we have limit the number of orders. oOO means to Fiverr you are not available to work, at all.
In 2014 you had 29-50000 designers in competition, today you have over 180000. There are no second chances in logo design today on Fiverr. You drop the ball once and it is going to collapse majorly.
I am actually thinking of deleting both of my logo gigs since that section is going bananas.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 5:33 pm",2020-09-09 21:25:06.512761

Demotions are far worst. A level demotion can cut your sales in half, maybe 75%. The good news is sometimes your old customers remember you. They don’t need to find you in the search results.
Some sellers ignore the level system and just market their gigs all over the place. It’s not my thing, but I respect them.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 5:37 pm",2020-09-09 21:25:06.895877

it seems like they really want to cancel and stop working with me.
If they are that kind of sensitive, or managed to misunderstand you so much that they interpreted your standard reminder that all other buyers so far reacted to with “sure”, as a threat, and even after your apology and all don’t want to work with you on future projects, that’s probably better.
That doesn’t, however, give them the right to cancel that current order which you already finished and spent your time on, which should be obvious to anyone who has a business of doing business really. It’s absolutely reasonable of you to not cancel and keep offering modifications in a reasonable scope. Of course, this might end with a bad review then, but you have the option to reply to that review and explain things from your POV.

“Noted on this! Just to let you know, the gig includes 1 free major revision and up to 3 minor revisions, after which I charge extra. So I would suggest compiling all edits into a list so that I can do all of it at 1 time to avoid the extra charge. :)”
As for a perhaps more delicate way of wording your standard message to cater to even the most precious snowflakes - maybe change things like “Just to let you know”, or “So I would suggest” - while it sounds harmless enough to me, there are people who’ll see an offence, threat, or whatever, in anything.
Perhaps something “softer”, like:
“Thank you for your message! The gig includes 1 free major revision and up to 3 minor revisions. If you compile all edits into a list, I can do all of it at once to save you time and the need to buy extra revisions. Looking forward to doing the edits for you :)”
“includes …” already says that anything beyond that will incur extra charges, so I don’t think you need to say that twice (“after which I charge extra”, and “to avoid the extra charge”).
However, that might then lead to more issues with people who need big signposts, and you may end up with more of those micro edit sessions again, so YMMV, maybe you can try it out.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 7:46 am",2020-09-09 21:26:19.315396

(I have shown the interaction to random people for feedback if I was rude or not as english is not my first language, and have been told that I was quite polite and just the buyer was overreacting)
I have apologized repeatedly and even offered unlimited revisions to placate him. But he has been unreasonable and repeatedly insisted I give him a refund. Which I refused as I have done nothing wrong and delivered the work on time and as discussed. So he has initiated a cancellation on his end. I just want to know, what happens if I dispute the cancellation?
Am I forced to continue to work with that buyer on the gig until he is satisfied? Or will the interaction with the buyer end and he gets the files and I receive my due payment?

Welcome to Fiverr, to start with. It’s wisdom to be and remain online as many Buyers would prefer to engage Sellers who are “available” by being online. While waiting, there are tons of what to do to increase your chances of clinching jobs. Won’t be a bad idea to search through the forum archives and implement those measures. Note that many Sellers, irrespective of level, do have “dry spells” (period of no Orders) from time to time. For me, at such times, I look around for what else to do, to brighten my chances of getting hired. Lastly, don’t be discouraged for not getting hired days after joining Fiverr. It took some weeks and for others, months to make first sale. No assurances when it’d happen. And you could get hired in a few hours you never know.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 6:59 am",2020-09-09 21:27:03.139403

I usually ask them nicely to please leave a review if they are satisfied and if they are not, to please contact me so I can’t make it right. I never ask for a specific type of review.
I’ve found that this kind nudge helped me get a review where perhaps without I it they wouldn’t have done anything.

If you then buy stuff in $ with PayPal (eBay, for example), you aren’t paying anything to convert. If you need GBP, convert from USD to GBP when the GBP is weak - losing 2.5% conversion fee.
As a general rule, freelancing online is always less appealing when you live in a country with a stronger currency / higher cost of living - and you are location independent in terms of work, so it pays to move. Conversely, if you live on a country with a cheap currency or very low cost of living, you can live very well doing very little, as $1 will stretch much more.

I just wasn’t prepared (or expecting) to lose such a massive amount of money in transfer fees. Because I withdrew a large amount of money, losing £200 in fees feels like a huge amount (it is!).
Sadly many buyers on Fiverr don’t appreciate the money us sellers lose in fees up to the point of money arriving in our bank accounts. As a proofreader, I try and set my hourly rate so that it’s affordable for small businesses. But even then I find that many European businesses (and I love Europe!) won’t want to pay any more than $15 an hour… after all the fees, this only leaves me with about $10 or about £8. This is below the living wage in the UK - and soul destroying for a professional writer with 25 years’ experience. Living expenses here in the UK are expensive…",N/A,"Apr 8, 2020 6:06 am",2020-09-09 21:27:53.216197

This isn’t a court of law. This is fiverr’s site.
True but on other sites, including Google’s if someone makes a complaint eg. copyright the person receiving the complaint has info info on it and can also make a counter claim. On Fiverr the sellers content gets removed without them being sure who complained/what the exact site was/what exact rules were supposed to have been broken.
The seller should also really get info so they are sure they don’t do whatever it is again (if they did do something against some site) as otherwise some other site could easily get a seller account closed whether they really did something wrong or not. That’s why they need enough info to defend against whatever (but it can be while also not giving private info away if poss - eg. just the public website name and whatever rule was said to have been broken and what page that’s on and a right for the seller to reply maybe).",N/A,"Mar 18, 2020 7:25 pm",2020-09-09 21:28:18.112913

So this happen last night.
A buyer order 6 orders worth 50 usd,
He purchased 6 basic gigs.
And when he send me the work they were all atleast for premium gig.
I requested him to cancel or pay the full price and extend the deadline as per the premium gig.
He refueses and threatened me with a bad review.
Then after 24 hours and getting 2 samples for free he cancelled 5 orders out of 6 and kept 1 order open and order another 1 basic order.
And now again wants me to work on a video which will roughly take 3 days and cost him atleast 100 usd.
I am constantly requesting him to cancel both orders but he is constantly refusing and forcing me.
One order is due in just 8 hours and the other one in 36 hours.
I’m a new seller but had 50 sales previously.
I have contacted support and opened 2 separate tickets to cancel this but it is more than 32 hours and the CS is not responding at all.
What should i do now.
CS is not responding and cancelling,buyer is refusing and blackmailing me,if i somehow deliver him this for 5 $, i know for sure he will leave a bad review or force me to work on one more video.

Hi @umar_shoaib1210,
Until you hear from CS, keep sending your buyer a cancellation request, no matter how many times he refuses to.
Please don’t keep opening tickets. CS is taking up to 10 days, or longer, to respond, due to the amount of work they’re having since the pandemic started.
I don’t know if in any of your open tickets you told CS your buyer was blackmailing you with leaving a bad review. In case you didn’t, go to the corresponding ticket and explain CS the situation, attaching proof of what you’re saying.",N/A,"Sep 9, 2020 2:24 pm",2020-09-09 21:29:29.453364

I think you could’ve outsourced the work if you had gotten them to agree to paying extra and getting an extension on the delivery date, and for the last one, it would’ve been as simple as installing GIMP and spending 10-15 minutes freehanding the selection and deleting the background.
Again, there’s only so much I can say without all of the information, but it sounds like you brokedown when you hit a wall. Next time fix the problem, don’t just look at it.
