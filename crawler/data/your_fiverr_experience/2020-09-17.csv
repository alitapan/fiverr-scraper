I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.

I realized soon that working myself to death for $10 was not going to get me to $200 a day.
I had a mindset that people were paying me for me to gain experience and to get solid reviews. I knew that was the key to Fiverr. I was working on other platforms to earn a little income.
When the time was right about a year into it, I raised my prices to $25. The business didn’t stop it just changed to better buyers. After about 3 months I increased it to $40 and that’s where I am now. They buyers are different at this price point and they are repeat buyers who tip.
To this day, I love the interaction with each buyer. I don’t use “auto responses” because I am a human!
When I met all the technical requirements of a Top Rated Seller I was curious why it didn’t just happen!? It’s because you are chosen based on EVERYTHING about your account. You MUST BE PROFESSIONAL IN EVERY COMMUNICATION! I was granted TRS in a month after I met the requirements and I work just as hard for $40 as I do $1,000.
My requirements have also evolved to be a good mix for the buyer ( and me) to understand each project before starting. Here they are:
Melissa Harlow VO Tone Requirement
1336×914 48.7 KB
My family also understands that I answer messages all day and night (even at 2AM)
As I can afford it, I upgrade equipment, training and education. I have a few Fiverr buddies who I communicate with to share stories and frustrations lol!
Lastly, it’s taken me about five years to minimize our lives so we have no debt and pay only cash for everything. This means I can work at my own pace and actually enjoy my life. A good Fiverr buddy asked me what my back up plan is during slow times and because of my simple living philosophy I said, “to go out and enjoy life because the slow times are small gifts of time to rest and rejuvenate without the worry of bills and a boss!
I hope you find this helpful and maybe comforting. Melissa","https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/a/1/c/a1c0a20e20a5d8c57aa2b0f60553439b9765037b.png

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.

do you have some sort of “rules” regarding revisions and extras explained in your gigs or do buyers see them in requirements for the first time?
What a great question! I do NOT explain the revision policy in my description but I do cover it in the FAQ section. I think my price point steers away the buyers who are willing to take advantage of revisions. I have had NO cancellations since instituting all of these requirements. In fact, I think it helps buyers think through what they need.
I really believe the key to a successful project is having the buyer take responsibility for the outcome too. There has to be solid communication for an online collaboration to work. I wish more sellers would take on this kind of stand. It’s being “firm but fair” and I think people respect you for that. It’s also like parenting…if you allow your children to walk all over you, it’s your fault too. Children crave structure and rules as much as love and empathy…I show the same respect to buyers.",N/A,"Sep 1, 2020 4:36 pm",2020-09-17 17:11:46.696404

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.

Inspiring Journey. Best of luck
I think that’s a good description… a journey. My travels across the ocean in our sailboat prepared me for any hardships. I came back a different person and just don’t sweat the small stuff. When you visit families on remote islands who by most 1st world standards have very little possessions, you realize that happiness is the real wealth. People great you with caring because it’s the right thing to do.
When you sail through storms and get thrown across a boat during a violent wave, you realize that health, family and a zest for life are the most important goals. Enough money comes if you follow your passion.",N/A,"Sep 3, 2020 11:05 pm",2020-09-17 17:11:52.017668

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.

Just yesterday I was finishing up a long narration and just as I went to send it out the power went out because of the heat! It was 115 here yesterday in San Diego which is extremely unusual! The power grid just couldn’t handle the load.
Then right at that same moment the dog was throwing up all over the carpet! And to top that off I sent the file to the wrong buyer in the craziness of the moment! So apologies, extreme heat and dog barf were the trifecta of the day! Oh yes my sister is in the hospital too!
So yes reaching our goals as a freelancer is challenging every day. But we have to just keep moving forward.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 3:03 pm",2020-09-17 17:11:55.790771

In your case your work wasn’t appreciated by the Buyer even if you tried your best. If you claim to be a professional then you should stand up to your name and do the job correctly.
If you think though by any chance the person was joking with you then you should Contact Customer Support for further information.

Thanks",N/A,N/A,N/A,humanissocial,6,"Knowing what keywords competitors use is useless. What are you going to do? Use those same keywords? Using high competition keywords means you’re extremely unlikely to benefit from them and you’re just further crowding the marketplace, which works against you, not for you.
Tools are only helpful if they show you what the BUYERS search for. Just because competitors use a term that doesn’t at all mean that term is what buyers are searching to find what they want. And even if they were, it wouldn’t tell you what terms have low competition but high demand and THAT is an SEO strategy. Not finding out what competitors are using and them using the same thing… How can everyone rank for the same terms? Seriously…
This isn’t a hack at all. Pretty ironic to see this from a supposed SEO expert with no apparent sales.",N/A,"May 6, 2020 6:15 pm",2020-09-17 17:13:03.879067

Is anyone else experiencing the same issue. I’m a buyer and reported Fiverr a very serious TOS voilation of a seller.
But Support keep marking my tickets as Sloved without even replying me once. That seller still selling third party content without licence.
Its very very weird behaviour of support,I encounter in my whole life.
Do Fiverr really wants the third party get involved in all this and sue them millions of dollars??
Should I inform the third party direct now as its now been more than 1 week. Nothing from support team.
please advice",N/A,N/A,N/A,ssj1236,2,"Hey, support is pretty backed up right now cause of the whole pandemic thing. If you made more than 1 ticket for the same issue then they’ll automatically get closed.",N/A,"Sep 17, 2020 2:26 pm",2020-09-17 17:13:19.177467

Everyone is dealing with this because the number of sellers has doubled or even tripled on Fiverr. The Fiverr algorithm is trying to showcase everyone, because everyone deserves a chance. I have 14k+ reviews and I am still removed from search, they bring me once in a while. It all started since the coronavirus pandemic hit and a lot of people started to create gigs on Fiverr.
So, it’s obvious that the system is working as intended. There’s nothing Fiverr can fix. Also, it can take up to 10 days for customer support to reply, again… due to the large number of inquiries.
To be honest, this is related to the algorithm, so any question to customer support regarding this will just waste time. It’s easy to see why they take 10 days to reply if everyone is asking them where are their gigs…

You don’t understand the problem.
I’ve been facing the same issue for the past week or so.
It’s not about gigs rotation, it’s about gigs disappearing from everywhere.
