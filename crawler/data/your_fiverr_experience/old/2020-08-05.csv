I’m one if the top seller in fiverr, I’m the top 10 in web scraping gigs from the last 5 months, but suddenly on 1st July ‘2020 my gig disappeared from search not even showing at end page.
I watched many tips in video like changing keywords, changing title, gig image but nothing worked. I tried to reach fiverr but they don’t give proper reply.
Don’t know this is done by fiverr or something else. I have 68 five start reviews out of my Last 70 reviews. I did 392 orders in the last 5 months with 266 reviews 98% reviews are 5*
I got received tips from 30% of Buyers. I got 20 best lengthy super reviews. What not. I got received 80 orders per month collected 26,000 USD in the last 5 months.
But I’m now helpless.

I’m not sure there currently is a ‘most popular’ design style. People have different tastes, and companies have brands. They’ll try to find something that fits their vision. If they don’t know what they want yet, that’s when you can try to promote your style or a style you can mimic.

HI, I just read your message here again , yes , I only do dance videos on fiverr . And before I came here on fiverr , I was a Cartoon characters and cartoon logo designer , and I have about 8 years experience with cartoon designer , see some of my design from six years ago . But I didn’t plan to do any work as cartoon design , because my eyes gets problems to use computer for too long time, and too many seller already do this work on fiverr . So I spend time to research Fiverr site , then I think music video is a big market , then I plan to work with my other skills ----- "" dance "" , and I start to learn video edit by PR and AE , to use together with my dance , to make my dance video different from other dancers . I do spend a lot of time for the hard work too, I’m not easy to getting all of those actually , it spend me a lot of time too
Soem of my design from six years ago

https://www.fiverr.com/iamsachmusic/create-african-american-t-shirt-design-67ef0b52-4a42-466f-ab18-bde4a357a6f5 5
This is the gig, it’s clearly mentioned that do not send me a direct order because every design costs different according to the design requirements.
And what happens, 3 wrong orders which cost $1h eacg and asking for $100 work each. When I tell them, they don’t want to continue. Then why I will suffer because of this? My order completion rate goes to 90% from 95% and also of course each cancellation affects the gig in some ways.
Contacted CS, they cannot do anything about it.

This is so rigged. I want to say so many things but professionalism. But where is the professional way to handle the orders? Why only seller sacrifice things.
It’s already covid19 and I am already suffering from depression, and these things happen. Why cannot they read a stupid line that I have mentioned?

The only thing I would try to make better would be the video lighting. You give a good detailed explanation in your video on what your gig is about, which makes me believe that what you offer will have plenty of information and help anyone out. This is a very specific niche that I personally can’t relate with, but if anybody is interested in horse racing, this would be my go to guy. I would like, however, if you added even more description under your video with key points, as in what specific things you will cover.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2015 11:31 am",2020-08-05 22:24:01.947554

I would probably write your website as a link on your profile, so I could see some examples of your work/posts. Also, I think that an eye-catching cover photo for your gigs could benefit as well. For example, the video games photo could be taken with natural lighting instead of indoor yellow lights, because it makes it easier to see. Also your other gig, with the purple writing, it’s a little hard to read at first glance unless I click on it. Overall, and other than those minor details, I really like your gigs!",N/A,"Aug 21, 2015 10:33 am",2020-08-05 22:24:02.342027

The only thing I would change is add some periods and “consistent punctuation” in your translating gig. Some bullet points have periods, while others don’t. Also slight grammatical errors in english, but I’m guessing romanian is your primary language.
Example of your original: ""I have DALF C1 Certificate in French, so I can say that I’ve a lot of experience. I’m a native Romanian. I made a lot of translations, especially for the children.""
Example fixed : I have a DALF C1 Certificate in French, so I can say that I have a lot of experience. My native language is Romanian as well. I have made many translations, primarily working on childrens’ (texts, books, works, whatever the children’s thing is).
Overall though, really cute, only minor adjustments.",N/A,"Aug 21, 2015 10:46 am",2020-08-05 22:24:02.749094

My only suggestion with you is get Grammarly, it will help you with your English. Better English might help you get better clients and more orders. I don’t recommend raising prices at this point, but once your gig reaches 50 or 100 reviews, you could raise your prices by $5 or $10. I prefer going from $10 to $20 than from $10 to $15. I like even numbers more than odds, but that’s just me.
I have no other suggestions other than that. Good luck to you.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2019 12:48 am",2020-08-05 22:24:20.036272

Thanks for your reply.
Please don’t mistake my angry rant on the forum with my approach to customer support in the past week. I’ve been doing my best to remain professional and cooperative.
I wanted to help them sort this issue and was willing to provide any information they might have needed from me. I even understood the first couple of times they told me to “try and get along with the buyer”.
I know this post sounds extremely toxic and I guess they just broke me at this point. There’s a limit to how much crap a person can take and remain civil.
Regarding their decision, I know it wasn’t the best one they could have made, because if it was the case would have been assigned to a single representative who would have done the effort of going through the facts, communicating with both me and the buyer and promptly informed me regarding the reason of the decision that was made (which they still didn’t btw. I have no idea what their reason for cancelling this order is).
Instead, my case switch hands between 8 different people in a single week.
I worked in customer support in the past and I have many friends who still do. I have never encountered a company which allows cases to be handled like this.
I honestly feel like having a single representative responsible for taking care of a case which involves thousands of USD is not an unreasonable expectation. Do you?",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 2:14 am",2020-08-05 22:24:54.371976

What a joke…",N/A,1,"Aug 4, 2020 6:30 am",tatjanamitevska,3,"My opinion of a very busy new seller on this platform.
First month I had my rates lower than my usually rates to get reviews and I didn’t really filtered my clients, I didn’t even know how. I got 2 difficult clients and 2 order cancellation after delivery, the first one ask for revision which was bigger than the project itself and the second one was a horrible person that’s all. I cancelled the first one because I was new on the platform and I didn’t know better and the second one was cancelled by CS and was source of my anxiety and stress for 2 weeks ( I should have send a medical bill to Fiverr to pay for it). Total money loss from completed orders: 700$ in the first month.
So, now I have different strategy, beside from filtering clients but in your situation maybe it doesn’t help since maybe you have already approved this client.
What works for my is price increase, I have increased my prices by 107% to cover my loss and minimize my risk. I keep my project duration 1 up to 2 days to protect myself from working on a order for too long if it doesn’t end well.
Also, don’t put all of your eggs in one bracket, don’t rely on Fiverr as a only source of income. It can be tempting if you are busy with order but on long run you put your entire business in the hands of an algorithm and the CS.
Increasing prices will get you less orders but more time to focus on your business outside the platform.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 6:24 am",2020-08-05 22:24:58.800119

I think Fiverr is enabling this kind of behavior for two main reasons.
The first being that they would rather piss off the working party rather than the paying party.
As a buyer, the amount of money you put in is pretty clear and therefore if something was done illegally, it is much easier to prove exactly how much you’ve lost.
As a seller, however, it is much more difficult to prove you are owed money you never possessed. Also, you would usually have put much more effort into the website and your gigs page, which would make it less likely that you would “turn on the platform”.
The second reason is purely saving money on the customer support side of things. I am pretty sure the formulaic responses as well as not actually reading what precious CS representatives have written, as well as the constant switch of cases between different CS reps means this department is just barely funded and they are overwhelmed with far more cases than they can realistically handle.
This of-course means it’s not really their fault, but the fault of management doing all they can to maximize profits at the cost of screwing us, the sellers.
The really baffling thing about all of this is that the fiverr TOS states the exact opposite of what they are actually doing, which makes me think they were probably forced to write them the way they did by some laws.
If I am correct, a legal action which would force them to comply with their own TOS is totally called for.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 5:01 am",2020-08-05 22:25:02.755593

That’s exactly what you should do, and it’s what I do for my accountant. Whenever I withdraw earnings, I issue an invoice to Fiverr (for the sake of accounts only, I don’t physically issue the invoice) to the amount of my commission for that withdrawal. I then immediately record a payment against the invoice, closing it off. You and your accountant then have an accurate record of all your earnings through Fiverr.

Tax IDs and countries are only relevant if you are selling directly to the person paying for them. But you aren’t. Fiverr is reselling your services on your behalf.

I had experienced this lately, when one cliënt ordered a simple $10 gig, but didn’t want to deliver image files (a request I demand to keep up the quality and speed).
The cliënt requested me to download the files from his site, but without reference to the imagelink or section. I communicated that I don’t do that, because it’s stated in the information about the Gig. The cliënt was too lazy and requested a cancellation.
As a true hardcore Fiverr-fan I thought, let’s cancel, so we’re both mutually happy (client and designer) so we can continue our own path. After mutual cancelation, I noticed my deliveryratio went down by 20%. Where it was 100% for years.
I really felt surprised and offended, as I thought it would help in customerservice being friendly for a mistake a cliënt made. I know there are always choices, but I think it’s weird Fiverr is only looking from a cliëntside. In this way customers can on purpose downgrade professionals.
I think this topic is a long discussion, but worth for Fiverr to have a look at.
What do you think as a Fiverr-seller, experienced this before and how did you react?",N/A,N/A,N/A,english_voice,6,"This is an often discussed topic - with very good reason.
No matter why an order is cancelled, it is the seller who is penalised.
If the buyer orders a gig by mistake - the seller is penalised.
If the buyer doesn’t read the gig description correctly and wants to cancel - the seller is penalised.
If the seller has completed the work (maybe several day’s worth of work) and the buyer decides to cancel - the seller is penalised and loses their income.
Even if the seller and buyer agree a mutual cancellation, the seller is penalised.
For freelancers who choose to base their business solely around Fiverr, their reputations and ability to earn can be destroyed in a matter of seconds by one or two bad buyers.
The Fiverr assumption appears to be the seller is always at fault when it comes to cancellations. It’s always been this way, so it’s unlikely to change.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:01 pm",2020-08-05 22:25:51.252336

The very first sentence on my Fiverr listing says this exactly:
Contact me before placing order so we can talk about the photos you want :)!
This is important because I do product photography, and there are certain items that I can’t or won’t photograph. One of those “wont’s” is clothes. I explicitly said this at the bottom of my listing details and in my Q&A:
I accept most types of products, as long as they are under 1.5 ft^3 (0.45 meters wide, long, and high). I do not photograph clothes.
I had a customer today break both of the aforementioned rules, though; they placed an order for me to photograph 6 t-shirts, and without contacting me first. I am not mad at them or anything; it’s an honest mistake that I probably could’ve done, too.
But should I be penalized for the customer ordering something that I specifically stated that I cannot do? I went and filed a dispute aiming to cancel this order, and I understand that this will hurt my order completion rate. I don’t feel like it’s fair to the sellers, and I also feel like this system leaves a lot of room for abuse. Sellers can sabotage their competition by placing absurd orders that they could not possibly go through with, thus resulting in the penalty when they inevitably have to cancel. For example, asking a graphic designer to make a song for them; graphic designers can use this technique to sabotage their fellow graphic designers.
Is there someone at Fiverr I can get in touch with to have this cancellation not count towards my order completion rate? Also, curious if anyone else has had a similar sort of experience. Thanks guys and gals !

If it ends with a cancellation, you can try to appeal to support, but your chances probably would be higher if you sent the customer an extra to pay the additional fee, since their motto is “work it out with the buyer”. Not sure if they’d help with your OCR if you didn’t “give the customer the chance to pay the additional fee” first (from their perspective, it’s probably in dubio pro reo, the customer might not have noticed the option for 24-hour delivery, or that they could have contacted you to ask about same-day delivery, etc.). It’s improbable with how they acted but not impossible that they’d accept your extra, and the cancellation would be avoidable then.
It’s unfortunate that support takes so long to respond at the moment; as he didn’t order the 24-hour extra, you might have enough time to ask support to cancel vs cancelling yourself before the deadline, but if not, that’s an additional issue because it wouldn’t just affect your order completion rate but also your delivered on time rate then.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 9:40 am",2020-08-05 22:27:00.465367

Yes that means you are paying for the right to use that voice in a broadcast such as TV or traditional radio.

It also depends on the Seller you select. My feeling is you are paying already to have my voice so the extra broadcast fee is there just so we are all clear on how you can use it.

It seems that your gig description or title is not appealing enough to get clicks.
For example, have you checked how many gigs have MailChimp logo on their cover photo?
Do a search on “mailchimp”. Almost every 3rd gig has the MailChimp logo. How does this make your gig stand out? If you were a buyer would you click on this gig, especially when it has 0 reviews?",N/A,"Dec 22, 2018 2:38 pm",2020-08-05 22:27:31.828642

You don’t make invoices or bill clients. Fiverr does that on your behalf. This is a marketplace.
Just make sure you’re following the laws of your country. But no law changes the fact that Fiverr is reselling your services.
Never sign off that you agree to ToS until you understand them. You don’t.

This is true, but Fiver is reselling on your behalf so income tax is the issue here. So you need to deal with income tax but not necessarily sales tax because Fiverr charges that on your behalf. But the rules do vary by country, but this is resale via a marketplace, not direct sale to clients.

Have a read of this thread, where this question was asked (and answered) earlier today. Should answer all your questions. I declare my Fiverr income here in the UK, and explain the method that I use in that thread. As @humanissocial has said, you need to ensure you’re following your own regional tax rules, but in terms of documenting your Fiverr income, you’re simply documenting the amount of commission you earn on the platform, not individual orders or by gig etc.
People over-complicate this when it’s actually pretty simple. And most accountants, especially the more old-school ones, really don’t ‘get’ Fiverr income.

How to send a proper buyer request?,Your Fiverr Experience,1,91,4,"Nov 23, 2018 11:46 pm",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 1:53 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/how-to-send-a-proper-buyer-request/292656,"devfoysal, page1ranker",page1ranker,4,"How to send a proper buyer request?
Last month I posted a request for a job in Fifa. I would like to raise the voice of the country, but the requests of some of the people who got the offer of sadness were very unprofessional - for which I had to select one of the other people on the condition of wanting.
Since then, many of us still have the basic idea of sending buyer requests. Still, they are continuously sending unprofessional buyer requests and the outcome is a negative connotation for our country’s freelancers to clients of outside countries.
So everyone who reads this post will read it properly, everyone can send the buyer request properly.
I try to show the rules that I accept as a cellar by sending a buyer request here.
In the case of sending a buyer’s request, keep in mind the following:
Choose the right offer: Only those requests are offered in a rugged way and the only thing you can do is send the offer to the request.
Take your time to read the description = There are many people send the offer without understanding everything completely! Thoroughly refrain from it.
What you do is, firstly pay attention to the buyer’s full recourse with time. Think carefully about what the buyer wants, then you can think that you can do that work 100% properly. Then you can click on “send offer”.
Keep your description clear, concise and to point = Your offer must be professionally written.
“Hello SIR / MADAM”
“Good morning / evening / other greetings”
“How are you?”
Avoid such unprofessional and irrelevant text.
Copy pasteed request to Everyone = Many of the newcomers, who have prepared a messy message, if you receive a request from your category, then copy and paste the same message.
Are you the people of that group? So avoid it today. It is never possible to get an order, because different clients will want different things, the same thing will be sent to everyone! Yes, you can send a few things in the same way, but if you think about sending the same prepared thing, you can expect the order to be removed.
You are sending a buyer request, not Eid greetings that will copy and paste the same thing with everyone.
Short and Sweet = Always try to write the offer as briefly as possible. Because more than you have got the buyout request, all the requests are very difficult to read, so the chances of avoiding additional big requests are more than likely.
Always keep in mind that the offer descriptiveness is not necessarily bigger.
Proper Pricing = Please do not send the offer of chicken to the person who has brought the cow corner budget, please! Remember, most clients want good quality, not less price.
If you think you have not been able to work at a higher price - so be prepared to get the job done for this situation, then quickly closing the Future tab and go to YouTube / Google and focus on increasing your skills. When the ability to work on the appropriate price, then return to Fever again.
Include the keyword = The keywords used by buyer must be properly used in the offer. You can understand that by looking at the buyer - you are well aware of what she wants, and you can understand all its recevrits properly.
Proofread offers = Before submitting the offer, take another look at everything like the exam paper, there is no error in it.
Be available = Buyer often likes the request, sending them text before ordering them. Make sure you can respond as soon as you have a buyer message. If you delay the message, then you will see the client cry out “Sorry I have hired someone else.”
Others = Sending a proper buyer request can not be learned suddenly in one day, after many experiments, you can easily understand how to send the appropriate offer. So follow the above rules, be patient, send regular requests.
Those Skills are sitting in many clays to give their jobs, try to be patient - get them.

This shouldn’t be a revelation or a secret - this is the absolute rock-bottom minimum requirement that should be instinctive to anyone in life, let alone a freelancer. There is an argument to say that anyone who needs to be told to read a job description before applying shouldn’t even consider a career as a freelancer. It hardly demonstrates the gut instinct, the talent and the determination it takes to succeed.
Also, on a personal level, I disagree that an individual should be falsely giving the impression that they are ‘a team’. Firstly, it sets up false expectations around quality control, response times, availability, etc. And secondly, I would argue that the majority of buyers prefer to deal with talented individual freelancers.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:40 am",2020-08-05 22:28:09.548861

“Fiverr’s Choice” seems to be random and useless,"Your Fiverr Experience

I’m not complaining about not getting picked out for the “Fiverr’s Choice” branding. I’m a successful seller, and I’m happy with where I’m at, even though orders have been slow this summer. They usually are, and the pandemic isn’t helping things. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s dive into why I think the Fiverr’s Choice is just a random branding that gets slammed on sellers for no reason at all.
I’ve been a successful voice-over seller on Fiverr for a few years now. In that time I’ve pulled in almost 500 five-star reviews, and I’ve completed just shy of 1000 orders. Yet, in all that time, delivering consistently high quality on all my orders, with only one negative review (because the buyer refused to pay for revisions as required) I’ve never, once, been awarded “Fiverr’s Choice”. Now that’s perfectly fine! I never expected to receive it, and I never much cared about such things.
Then, to my surprise, a new seller in my category, who delivers voice overs with a similar level of quality from what I can see, but has less than 20 reviews and less than a year on Fiverr, gets awarded the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge on his gig. Good for him. I keep getting orders anyway, so I’m not worried.
I do however think that something as visible as the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge should be awarded based on some sort of manual process. This is, after all, Fiverr saying “This is the service we, as the go-to platform for freelancing services online, recommends above all the others!”. That implies that some sort of manual process is involved.
One can only speculate as to which requirements Fiverr uses internally for this evaluation. When a seller with several years of great performance, no ToS warnings, almost 1000 delivered gigs and only positive reviews for years, is never once awarded this, but a new seller who delivers roughly the same quality with less than 20 reviews gets it, I become curious:
Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” just a random badge awarded for no reason at all?
I’ve seen several level 2 and top level sellers with 1k reviews or more who delivers some of the best quality I’ve ever found on Fiverr, with no such badge, so I decided to test two sellers in the same category.
One was a Level 1 Fiverr’s Choice seller with 34 positive reviews. The other, a level 2 seller with 1k + reviews - all of them positive.
Both were in the VO category, and both had the same exact pricing.
I’m not gonna publish the deliveries here, since I don’t want to cause anyone a bad reputation, but I will say that the quality from the level 2 seller was miles above the quality from the “Fiverr’s Choice” seller.
The friendly and useful information and support was also great from the level 2 with no “Fiverr’s Choice” badge, while the seller that Fiverr thought would offer the best service and quality consisted of the standard automatic replies.
From the order was made until it was delivered I received both a “Thank you” confirmation manually written from the Level 2, and a follow up when he started recording, two versions of the VO, and a well-written message to go along with it.
The Fiverr’s Choice seller however, delivered one single take, managed to gate the audio to hell and back (if you’re a VO you know what I’m talking about, if not, that’s basically cutting out all audio below a certain volume. Too much noice gate = not good!).
The message from the VO Fiverr had selected as their choice wrote “Here ya go! Pls give be good feedback.”.

If I’m not satisfied with the final delivery, 5r should take responsibility. After all, if I’m buying based on their recommendation, they should have vetted them.
I’ve bought from TRS with less than quality work so I don’t put any stock into those badge. I go with gut instinct based on the quality of their gigs and writing skills.
I suppose some buyers wouldn’t know that. I think 5r is taking a big risk. What if their choices are mediocre to bad. All 1st time buyers will be turned off and think this platform is a joke. Unfortunately, 5r has low review and trust levels on many sites.
Each his own, I think it’s a random generator. I could be wrong, after all TRS is supposed to be vetted too.
I do admit, that 5r has gotten better at promoting true professionals to TRS lately. That wasn’t always the case though.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 6:06 pm",2020-08-05 22:28:18.544867

If it was totally random the sellers who are here longer would get picked more often. It’s probably based on some info like has been suggested (eg. ratings (including the private feedback), on time deliveries, completion rate etc.). There may be some random element after that. It probably would also take into account the number of Fiverr choice badges it’s already given out currently in that subcategory, and maybe whether/how often it’s previously been given to that gig.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 6:57 pm",2020-08-05 22:28:19.328835

Now that we have that out of the way, let’s dive into why I think the Fiverr’s Choice is just a random branding that gets slammed on sellers for no reason at all.
I’ve been a successful voice-over seller on Fiverr for a few years now. In that time I’ve pulled in almost 500 five-star reviews, and I’ve completed just shy of 1000 orders. Yet, in all that time, delivering consistently high quality on all my orders, with only one negative review (because the buyer refused to pay for revisions as required) I’ve never, once, been awarded “Fiverr’s Choice”. Now that’s perfectly fine! I never expected to receive it, and I never much cared about such things.
Then, to my surprise, a new seller in my category, who delivers voice overs with a similar level of quality from what I can see, but has less than 20 reviews and less than a year on Fiverr, gets awarded the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge on his gig. Good for him. I keep getting orders anyway, so I’m not worried.
I do however think that something as visible as the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge should be awarded based on some sort of manual process. This is, after all, Fiverr saying “This is the service we, as the go-to platform for freelancing services online, recommends above all the others!”. That implies that some sort of manual process is involved.
One can only speculate as to which requirements Fiverr uses internally for this evaluation. When a seller with several years of great performance, no ToS warnings, almost 1000 delivered gigs and only positive reviews for years, is never once awarded this, but a new seller who delivers roughly the same quality with less than 20 reviews gets it, I become curious:
Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” just a random badge awarded for no reason at all?
I’ve seen several level 2 and top level sellers with 1k reviews or more who delivers some of the best quality I’ve ever found on Fiverr, with no such badge, so I decided to test two sellers in the same category.
One was a Level 1 Fiverr’s Choice seller with 34 positive reviews. The other, a level 2 seller with 1k + reviews - all of them positive.
Both were in the VO category, and both had the same exact pricing.
I’m not gonna publish the deliveries here, since I don’t want to cause anyone a bad reputation, but I will say that the quality from the level 2 seller was miles above the quality from the “Fiverr’s Choice” seller.
The friendly and useful information and support was also great from the level 2 with no “Fiverr’s Choice” badge, while the seller that Fiverr thought would offer the best service and quality consisted of the standard automatic replies.
From the order was made until it was delivered I received both a “Thank you” confirmation manually written from the Level 2, and a follow up when he started recording, two versions of the VO, and a well-written message to go along with it.
The Fiverr’s Choice seller however, delivered one single take, managed to gate the audio to hell and back (if you’re a VO you know what I’m talking about, if not, that’s basically cutting out all audio below a certain volume. Too much noice gate = not good!).
The message from the VO Fiverr had selected as their choice wrote “Here ya go! Pls give be good feedback.”.
What do you guys think? Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” a badge of quality, or a badge of being targeted randomly by the algorithm?",N/A,2,"Aug 4, 2020 6:46 pm",miiila,7,"I only noticed I had the badge on a gig when an order came in that had some banner telling me to perform outstandingly to get more Fiverr’s Choice orders or something, that wasn’t too long ago; ever since, I’ve had a few more Fiverr’s choice orders, they come and go. Recently, I apparently had the badge on my “second main gig” instead of my bestseller, as an order I got on that gig had the banner. It wasn’t as if I got swamped with orders or anything though, so probably not too much to worry about if one has it or not, or if others have it or not.
It might make it a bit more probable that people order directly without contacting you, so it can be a double-edged sword, depending if one likes direct orders without prior contact, or not.

My name is Florian Thana, 26 from Albania and I specialize in Marketing and Advertising industry. I was living a distracted life now I finally found a way to occupy my time. Now I work as Social Media Manager 1. I love working with passionate people and sharing what I’ve learned with them. This introduction is my window to the forum where you can find more about me and then get in touch for a chat about potential projects. I can do promotions on various social platforms groups I researched and gathered on private list, with thousands, millions of followers. Graphic designs with canva for any social media platform, logos, covers, flyers etc. Seo analysis report, keyword research and competitor analysis. Also I have a big collection of eBooks with resell rights license 2 (PLR, MRR) wich contain precious information about marketing since we are on fiverr. I didn’t even have this skills few months ago but reading around about Fiverr on Forbes I found out. So If I did it here, you reader can also. If you want to learn something specific for few dollars you also have great courses on Fiverr buy qualified people.
Thanks for reading whoever did and I hope someone hires me

Almost all the active seller get a chance to come on the first page. It depends on how active you are in Fiverr.
None of this is true. Please don’t say things you can’t corroborate.
My saying it’s untrue that all Active sellers get a chance to be on the first page doesn’t mean I’m saying inactive sellers get to be on the first page. I’m not saying that at all and your interpretation of what I said is totally illogical.
That’s like saying if I say not all fresh oranges make it to grocery stories that that must mean I’m saying that spoiled oranges make it to grocery stores. See? It makes no sense to think I am saying that.
You’re saying all active sellers get to be on the first page. That’s just plain wrong and nothing you just argued proves it does.
There are hundred of thousands of active sellers, often 20,000 sellers per sub category. There are less than 40 spots on the first page. So how could everyone get a turn on the first page? It doesn’t even make sense.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 10:25 pm",2020-08-05 22:30:14.229369

A buyer who says they will “cancel the order to prevent you from getting a bad rating” is talking complete rubbish.
Firstly, they have already received your work. You should fight the cancellation.
Secondly, a cancellation will affect your stats. The Fiverr algorithm will no doubt now perceive you to be a less reliable seller.
Thirdly, you could interpret the buyer’s comment as a threat. In other words “accept the cancellation otherwise I will leave negative feedback”.
Fourthly, it’s not your problem that the buyer changed their mind. It is the buyer’s fault. Or, as a I suspect is the case, they simply wanted free work from the beginning.

SMS (short message service) is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet, and mobile device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols to enable mobile devices to exchange short text messages. An intermediary service can facilitate a text-to-voice conversion to be sent to landlines.

This might sound like a very small thing - but in your profile and gig descriptions as well as your gig titles, you haven’t left a character space after full stops / periods (.) or commas (,). This is a basic grammatical requirement of the English language. Because you’ve not done this, it makes your descriptions look careless to native English speakers, and it looks a mess on the page.
For example you’ve written:

The weather is hot during the day (around 27-30 degrees), and cold at night (it can be even 7 degrees). Baltic Sea is cold in general, and water temperature is 18-22 degrees, but it’s totally fine for me. It’s like going to Spain in October.
However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

Please refrain from using those kind of words in the future",N/A,1,"Aug 5, 2020 4:19 am",saddam2016,3,Le me explain the whole story here now. Actually the buyer was my old client and he used to give work before each time when ever he gives work he pays so so so less as compared to the market value of that work. But I accepted and delivered. This time he gave work related to data entry I did not have much work at that time these were around 370 rows on excel sheet. He wanted me to update names of topics + finding relevant images for those topics which are free to use + he wanted me to add screenshots of proof that those images are for commercial use. That work was so tough that a normal data entry operator could not have done. Still I accepted and took my time to work the things out so that I can build a good relationship with that buyer later. I delivered it after 10 hours of constant working and guess what was he paying for it? 5$ lolzz. I made my mind to not accept more of excel sheet orders from him in the future. But after some time he offered me more work this time he offered 40$ and did not mention that these are 40$ for 8 worksheets. He sent a corrupted excel sheet. I tried my best to open it. The sheet did not open. I tried converting it online it still did not open. When I was left with no other option then i asked him to deliver it on google sheets. When I opened the sheet I saw that these were 333 rows and work is the same as it was done before. I thought he has realized that 5$ were so less for previous work that is why he will give me 40$ for this time. I accepted work. He said dont work on live spreadsheet copy paste work on MS excel. I was an idiot I did not realize he will scam me here. I even sent him the sheet before dlivering that work and he said its ok deliver work. When I delivered he said where are other 7 sheets? I said you sent me just one sheet. He sent that google sheet link again. When I opened it then I saw that there were 7 more tabs with rows around 300 to 400. I got shocked and started explaining him what happened here. He did not listen. I said increase money you have tricked me here. He said cancel order. I tried to negotiate but he refused to offer more money. I was already scammed alot before I made my mind to fight back. He opened dispute I declined. After some time CC cancelled my order and put my account under review and client had his money back.,N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 3:12 am",2020-08-05 22:34:05.803692

You should have stated your new terms with them before proceeding, a job as tedious as you described is worth more than $5 and then multiplied by 8??

saddam2016:
I had no option but to cancel it
That is youR first mistake. Fiverr CC can’t do anything after you agreed to mutually cancel the order. That’s it, nothing to investigate and all they can do is sorry you had a bad experience.
saddam2016:
They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders.
We all go through that. ALL OF US. All cancellations affect our “ranking” and position where gigs are shown. Fiverr algorithm decides where and how to show gigs based on the performance and fiverr CS can not fix that just because you want it.
saddam2016:
But I accepted and delivered
You didn’t have to agree for 5$ but you did.
saddam2016:
I thought he has realized that 5$ were so less for previous work that is why he will give me 40$ for this time
Why would she realise that if you agreed for that work and never discussed that with her?
**Guess what? If you multiply 8 by 5 =40$. **
8 sheets for 5$ is 40$ in total and that’s exactly what your buyer offered you. She took your previous price you agreed for and multiplied by the amount of work she had this time.
On the last point: your account restriction, you still didn’t tell us what exactly you were banned for. They sent you an email telling you what tule you violated.
Everything you are describing here is a normal freelancing process and we all go through working with difficult clients, it’s all about how you handle it and in this case it is unfortunately on you and solely you not being able to manage properly your clients.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:43 am",2020-08-05 22:34:12.141739

Well to be fair you did deliver incomplete delivery.
I already did the math for you
8 sheets for 5$ each is 40$ and that’s exactly what your buyer offered you and sent to you.
I’m sure it was also a surprise for her that you sent only one sheet this time and started asking for more money only after delivering the first sheet.

everything was pre planned here
Of course it was “pre planned”. You did first project for 5$ so for the second order she sent you 8 sheets for 5$ each which is in total 40$. I’m pretty sure she wasn’t planning to scam you and only expected from you to do exactly the same as you did for her first order for the same price. That’s it.

If he would not have known then why he said its ok go deliver it.
Because it was ok to deliver that sheet And she didn’t have revisions for that sheet. And most likely she thought you will go one by one. She said ok to this file and after that as you mentioned she was expecting for you to start working on other files
Look there is no “scam”. And if there is then it’s actually you who tried to get 5$ one sheet for 40$.
Corrupted file most likely is just a coincidence.
And that’s not a scam if you agreed for 5$ price and your buyer asked you to do 8 sheets for 5$ (which is 40$) in total.
She asked you EXACTLY what you agreed for. And it’s not her problem to be honest that you suddenly decided that one sheet should cost 40$ without discussing or agreeing that with her.

I called help from support they did nothing but copy and pasting message of we are sorry you had bad experience blaa bla bla. They were not done here. They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders. My first query took them 16 days to respond to me and do nothing. Second query about moving my gigs to last pages is still in process and is in queue now for 9 days. I suffered for nothing this marketplace is all full of ************* scammers now.

should also be careful with such scams. But you guys dont want it then its ok.
If so many people telling you that it’s not scam but a miscommunication don’t you think it’s you who’s wrong but not everyone else?
Look people on the forum like conspiracies and totally do not give an easy time for difficult clients and trying to advise sellers on their situations. Your situation is a miscommunication and not a scam.
I would’ve loved to say it’s a scam but it’s not. And the math your buyer did only proves it.

Even on this forum they have their agents always ready to exploit the seller. and you humanisocial I have always seen you discouraging the sellers on other forums too and being so rude to defend fiverr by all means. This is not the first time. There are a couple of more faces who are also always ready to blame the seller. So I now understand that it is also a waste of time to discuss a matter here. Its better if I save time here and utilize this time finding jobs on other better platforms. I will just learn from some of my mistakes here and find better platform to build a portfolio.

This isn’t a new trick. You didn’t have to cancel the order. It’s so sad that sellers here on Fiverr accept to work for peanuts and then actually believe that the buyer will treat them with respect. Don’t accept these kinds of orders for $5. This is what you are being penalized for, you’re also being punished for cancelling the order. If you can’t stand up for yourself, why should Fiverr support, for them looking into a cancelled 5 Dollar order is not worth the time or the effort because you agreed to a mutual cancellation.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 7:13 am",2020-08-05 22:34:43.278737

Now when they are also aware that it is not the seller fault then why they penalize my account and moved all of the gigs to the last page? What was my fault in it. I contacted them again and my ticket is again in queue now for 9 days.
Did you even read what I wrote to you before?
It looks like you just ignored everything.
But I’ll be kind enough to quote myself again on your first cancellation and your gigs moving to the last page. In both cases fiverr can’t do anything and we are all playing by the same rules. Algorithm is based on the performance and all cancellations are bad performance. And fiverr can’t do anything if YOU AGREED to cancel the order.

I had no option but to cancel it
That is youR first mistake. Fiverr CC can’t do anything after you agreed to mutually cancel the order. That’s it, nothing to investigate and all they can do is sorry you had a bad experience.
saddam2016:
They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders.
We all go through that. ALL OF US. All cancellations affect our “ranking” and position where gigs are shown. Fiverr algorithm decides where and how to show gigs based on the performance and fiverr CS can not fix that just because you want it.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 7:22 am",2020-08-05 22:34:44.066578

You seem to have an issue understanding English. I wasn’t saying you broke a law. It was an analogy. You miscomprehend almost everything people have said to you here.
And no, Fiverr isn’t going to make buyers agree to things that weren’t in their contract. If you want to talk about breaking laws — that would be it.
You’re trying to make me see you understand contracts by arguing Fiverr should able to make buyers pay for things that didn’t fulfill their contract. Please note the irony.
You had a giant loophole in your contract. You’re saying you get to claim that loophole means something the contract doesn’t say it means. But I suppose my pointing this out to you must mean I’m an agent of Fiverr.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 8:10 am",2020-08-05 22:34:47.618907

At the time of phone verification, Fiverr asked me to put my elementary school name, I put my full elementary school name, it takes almost 40 letters to complete my elementary school name, I successfully verified my phone number by putting this name. But when I tried to enable 2 step verification option, Fiverr asked me to fill my elementary school name again, but I failed, because it has shown letter limit, I just able to put 20 something letters only and it showed me incorrect elementary school name. What can I do now? I wasn’t able to put my full school name because of the letter limit. In the future, if I failed to verify me, maybe I get BAN from Fiverr. I’m so afraid about this my friend.

That’s exactly what we are trying to explain to all newcomers.
There is no “career” building on fiverr, your client is not your boss, fiverr is not your employer.
Freelancing might look tempting and all this videos “how to make money on fiverr with no skill” in YouTube also doesn’t help.
But it’s much easier to be employed than being a freelancer.

I’m a reasonably competent individual and I’ve been with Fiverr for seven years.
While it’s only ever been a part-time business for me, in all my time here (from hundreds of orders), I’ve only had one truly horrific experience (which CS resolved in my favour) and maybe half a dozen or so experiences that I would rather forget - ironically, one this week. So that’s an average of one bad experience a year. Not bad really.
If, as a seller, you offer a clear proposition that’s well written and backed up by good feedback, and you use your gut instinct to weed out the messages from potential buyers that you know will only lead to trouble (for me that means messages that are badly written) - then you stand a chance of running a near hassle free little business.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:10 am",2020-08-05 22:35:21.567761

No, it is not because you are new. You cannot sell anything for less than $5 on Fiverr. If you want to sell at a rate of $1 per minute, I suggest you sell your basic package at $5 for 5 minutes.

For advice gigs, again, most people use an image that represents the idea of love, help, friendship.

I also just started a blog with the sole purpose of supporting my advice gigs. I thought of it as a place where potential buyers can catch a better glimpse of my approach before ordering. Needless to say, it is all for nothing if nobody is clicking on my gig.
Could you take a look at my gigs and give me an idea of what could be wrong?
Thank you for any help you can offer!

That’s also incorrect. Why do you think you should let someone exploit you to protect your ratings? That’s so wrong.

No, your suggestion is not correct , if his old gigs already has sell and with good reviews , he don’t need to create new one and then delete the older one again and again , that way won’t help to get sell, just waste time .

Actually the buyer was my old client and he used to give work before each time whenever he gives work he pays so so so less as compared to the market value of that work. But I accepted and delivered. This time he gave work related to data entry I did not have much work at that time there were around 370 rows on excel sheet.

That work was so tough that a normal data entry operator could not have done. Still, I accepted and took my time to work the things out so that I can build a good relationship with that buyer later. I delivered it after 10 hours of constant working and guess what was he paying for it? 5$ lolzz. I made my mind to not accept more of excel sheet orders from him in the future.

I was an idiot I did not realize he will scam me here. I even sent him the sheet before delivering that work and he said its ok deliver work. When I delivered he said where are other 7 sheets? I said you sent me just one sheet. He sent that google sheet link again. When I opened it then I saw that there were 7 more tabs with rows around 300 to 400.

I’ve had a customer once who ordered the same gig 3 x … she probably thought the order hadn’t gone through, and tried again. Fiverr refunded the 2 “surplus orders”, of course.
Another time, a regular buyer ordered, and because we’d been talking in the inbox and I noticed that she hadn’t accepted my offer, which was very unusual, I asked her, and she said she had accepted it but that indeed, just like for me, no order showed up. She contacted support, sometime later, the order was there. It doesn’t happen that often, but it does happen. In any case, it will be sorted out, you might need some patience though, as response times currently aren’t as fast.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 3:30 am",2020-08-05 22:38:04.279275

We have all seen conversations get flagged if we say certain words (like pay, email or use an @) One of my clients had requested that I add a paypal link to the website I had just set up for him. Perfectly reasonable, right? I thought it was ok…so I proceeded to walk him through the process of generating the code from his paypal account that I would need to add the button he requested. Apparently I used the word “paypal” too many times and they flagged the whole thing. That’s what I got my first warning for–doing something that was within the rules but my account got flagged seemingly automatically based on words I used. On the other hand, I have had clients use the same words or phrases that I know get flagged. I have tried to conduct business as usual but I am afraid that my account could be flagged like that again for something my clients may discuss. Part of what I offer involves setting up social media accounts for people and then managing those accounts. Most social media requires 2 step authentication and the attachment of a phone number for verification. I usually try to get this information in my “gig requirements” but you are always going to have people who don’t put that information in there and you end up having to ask them “what email is associated with this account” or “I need a phone number so they can send your verification code” and that very well could end up getting flagged.

I was working on the gig one minute and then got a notification the next that the buyer wanted to cancel it. The buyer was unresponsive completely after that.

Getting that first job was a huge encouragement for me to take a look at which gigs were getting clicks and which ones needed some reworking or attention. My services offered include Wordpress setup and social media setup/management. I also added content writing to that and a custom job starting at $5. I found that this custom job seemed to be my best seller for a while but then I began offering the corresponding gig even if the client contacted me on the custom gig. The result is that my stats are up on the other gigs and now they are selling more and more. It seems that if you offer a broad service and something practical, an everyday service, you will get clicks. I ended up having to pace myself a little bit as of late though. I set a limit on some of my gigs so that it won’t let me accept more than 3 active ones at a time on certain ones. This helps me with time management and on time delivery.
On time deliveries also affect your stats that other users see. I have a 100% on all of my feedback and other items. This is evaluated every so often so if you do have a canceled order or late delivery for some reason or another, it will fall off after a few months.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 12:10 am",2020-08-05 22:39:42.587590

That is how you make your GiG best selling!,Your Fiverr Experience,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/that-is-how-you-make-your-gig-best-selling/496007,N/A,datascientistt,3,"Me and my friend started working on fiverr few months ago. Till last month,I only had few orders, but in comparison he was level 2 seller with 100 plus projects completed just in 2 and half months.
Finally, I asked him of his secrets. I am going to share his secrets that landed me 25 plus projects in 1 month and i am now level 1 seller too with almost 500 plus dollar earning in a month.
The trick is to land on First page.
Initially, when you start working you won’t get any projects from people but as soon as you get reviews people start to prefer you. So instead of using multiple gigs , focus to have one gig with at least 7 plus reviews. After 7-10 reviews your gig gets displayed over first 3 pages. But mine got displayed on first page first line after 5 reviews and here is what me and my friend did.
We became Best seller.s Good buyers change the search options to best selling from relevance and that is where you get good buyers. To have a best selling GIG, it is all about communication. When you complete your project and buyer rates it. They also get an email after few days for another rating that sorts our gigs and leave feedback for fiverr. If you really had worked hard and made your customer happy (not just satisfied) that is where you get success. Try it ! Or you can search “matlab” and find the best selling gig with my name. Remember, I am assuming you have done all necessary modifications such as videos, self made pictures, nice descriptions, and proper tag etc.
Thanks me later For any question feel free to ask.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-05 22:40:51.788870

I’ve been selling on Fiverr for seven years now. Anecdotally I can tell you that the number of sellers has gone through the roof in recent months. The competition is fierce and sadly the many new bad sellers drown out the good sellers.
You only need to spend 10 minutes browsing the forums to see posts like “new seller what do I do?” and “new seller no sales” and “new seller can I buy reviews?”.
Again anecdotally, long-term sellers who had built a good reputation prior to the boom in new sellers still appear to be doing well, but many new sellers are struggling.
There’s no point in giving up as you’ve done the hard bit already (creating your gigs) - but maybe just let your gigs be and hope that a buyer comes along.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 6:16 am",2020-08-05 22:41:02.851810

That’s one thing I try to avoid. I don’t think it’s a good idea to sell your experience for cheap. But as competition grows the price is falling. Who profits? Not the average seller I’d say.

I definitely see your point. My regular clients pay for my expertise and experience in the field, rather than my hours or the overheads, and for someone like me, I can afford to charge much less than my usual - especially on Fiverr, where others offering the same service charge anywhere between $5 and $30, and some even use stolen stock.
For me, I want to bulk up my client base, and get a backlog of excellent reviews on Fiverr. Once I’ve achieved that, my prices will go back to normal (with a small increase compared to my normal rates to cover fees). It’s an approach that I believe has worked. Would the customers I’ve had so far have paid my normal rates? Possible, but also it’s unlikely.
I do agree with the sentiment that prices fall as competition increases. Fiverr sellers in my industry consistently undercharge for their services (as mentioned above, some shadier sellers even use stolen images and unlicensed fonts!) which has made some customers believe that these lower rates are the norm.

Thanks for your comments…",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:22 am",indigo_dc,3,"As a buyer, I find it very, very hard to find quality sellers. Although not in the market for audio - almost all of what I need is graphic design - I’m primarily looking for either quick concepts to flesh out my designs and get it ready to prototype, then later on I need professional work to truly bring the product to life.
What I find is an absolute glut of cheap, generally quite poor sellers where all their gigs look identical. I’ve tried a few and they have all been an utter waste of money. It’s now leading me to leave the platform because the tools available to me as a buyer mean I can’t find artists who are maybe more expensive than the basic $5 gig but below the $50 gig, and who are able to not only listen to the brief BUT add some inspiration into the mix.
If that sounds like I’m asking for “cheap top tier creativity”, I’m not really - I guess what I want to be able to find are sellers where I can say roughly what I want and at minimum, get that. But what I’d love are sellers where I say roughly what I want, get that but also something of the seller’s creativity & personality there that will really set things apart - and when I find that, you can be damn sure I’ll be paying for more of it.

What I find is an absolute glut of cheap, generally quite poor sellers where all their gigs look identical.
I think there are sellers around who just use algorithmic logo generators and try to sell this as unique logo to you. (If you are looking for logos) I have seen some youtube advice about that.
But in the end: if you are just willing to buy for 5 bucks you won’t get quality work. (I’m not speaking of you, just general)
It also depends on where you live. If you are working from a country with low costs you have the advantage to charge less. But here in Germany a freelancer has to charge around 50€ per hour or more to be profitable…",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 8:23 am",2020-08-05 22:41:16.450651

Think about this: how sustainable are your prices? As a freelancer you have to pay everything on your own. Don’t compare yourself with a contract worker. What about your health insurance? Do you wan’t to go to holidays? What if you get sick? You have to do so many things you won’t get paid for (taxes, accounting…)
You won’t get jobs from nine to five. So those few gigs you are doing have to cover everything.
Here is some advice I found:

I can never emphasise this enough. Try picking your niche, it has helped me A LOT. Let me show you what I mean. (Just an example) “I will edit any kind of video”, instead do “I will edit gaming videos”. This increases the chance of getting sales and let me explain why. With a generic term like the first one, competition is more fierce. Now with the second term, although people may search that term fewer then the generic one, the chances of getting a sale is higher due to having less competition.
I joined fiverr like three months ago. My first gig was not a success and I deleted it as I had better talents. When I got my second gig and third gig, they were a hit due my niche and not having a lot of competition (I only had like 2-3 sellers as competition and that helped me)

Well, that is not the case.
I started working as a seller, from Dec 18th, 2019, and I have been doing great.
completed 104 total orders to date. and earned a lot amount of money and reputation. Got level two seller badge and all.
and yeah I am from the same audio and music field. There are several things you might consider,
First of all, focus on your visual representation of your gigs. The more visually pleasing they are the more buyers will click on it.
2. Catch your buyers with words that are pleasing, try to question them in the description what are they looking for and provide the answer also. Convince your buyer that you are a big deal and they will have a great experience working with you.
It worked for me.
3. Takedown your gig price, some of them are utterly expensive and no buyer will buy something so expensive from a new seller. start at $5. gradually increase the price once you got hold of some good looking reviews and some badge.
4. Send buyer request daily. make a daily target to send 10 buyer requests daily and use the same tactic while writing to your buyers. First, let them know you will do what they want, then start asking questions like, what is the duration, Do you have a reference track, do you have an artist in mind, Will you record your vocals and send them to me, etc etc. and in the end write, Let’s have a chat and discuss this further. Believe me, it will work. If you can get one buyer to get into your inbox daily, you will have the chance.
and last but not least. Keep trying. It will work one day and you will be happy that you didn’t left.
Good Luck.",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 12:52 pm",2020-08-05 22:41:21.304559

I’m struggling with this strategy. Not sure if it’s the right thing to do
I started on five and once i got level one badge i increased my price and on level two added some extra bucks to the gig. and also 5 is just a number, Once you have buyer in hand you can provide proper quotation of your service. Also always try to make 3 gig packages, I mean, $5 less quantity of tracks etc, $15 more tracks plus something more, and then finaly $30 $40 $50 dollar package, unlimited tracks, stem files, project file etc etc.
and dont forget to add extras to the gig options. Like commercial usage fees, Full exclusive rights fees etc etc. This is always give you some extra money.
Good Luck.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 10:17 am",2020-08-05 22:41:24.878139

Sorry, but i think you got the wrong idea.
what i meant is to offer custom order to the buyer. I buyer will come seeing $5 tag and will contact you but most of the time buyer doesnt read what are you providing in $5. Like one of my gig states $5 for a 30sec track which includes 4 instruments and delivery will be mp3 file,
But what buyer is asking you to make is 1min track with more than 4 instruments and High Quality wav file with commercial usage, Will you give it to them in $5. Never.
So my point was, buyer always comes to $5 gigs but most of the time their requirments will require a custom order which most of the time buyers accept as it will still be cheap from high end pro sellers.
I hope you got my point.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 10:33 am",2020-08-05 22:41:25.629321

You might already be good enough to pass the exam with a good score. Don’t forget, it tests for basic English skills, which obviously you have, as we’re both chatting in English.
If you do want to study for the test, read up on pronouns, verb tenses and moods (the conditional), and prepositions. There are lots of questions on those topics.",N/A,"Mar 5, 2020 9:24 am",2020-08-05 22:42:13.253263

Fiverr Customer Support will cancel orders based on, but not limited to, the following reasons:
Delivered Orders (after the Seller clicks Deliver Now and before the order is marked as complete)
The Seller requests additional payments, on or off the Fiverr platform, by withholding the final delivery of services directly related to the agreed requirements.
So the big questions is: is what you’re asking for part of the original scope of the order?

Well, it’s been few months since I joined fiverr. I have been basically working on designing stuff.
I received an order from a buyer and the buyer was so impressed, that the buyer kept on ordering my gig for 5-6 times. But I haven’t received order from any other buyer on that gig.
I want to know whether this “repeat buyer” thing really helps my gig or does it make it suspicious to fiverr algo that it might have removed my gig from front pages.
Please have a look at my gig and it will be really helpful if you could make some suggestions.

Please search for the low competition keywords for gig title, Make sure your description is strong and effective. Don’t use too many repetitive words in the gig description. Use tags most related to your Gig title. and the most recommended thing is “Buyer Request” you will get daily 10 requests to send offers, make sure to use that 10 offers on a daily basis.
Keep struggling

It’s not my job to do your work for you. I’ll point out resources, but you have to be able to help yourself.
I glanced at the 3 other threads you have in the “Improve My Gig” category, and I don’t see this one linked either: Buyer Requests - Leadership Suggestions on Buyer Request Complaints (Few Requests, BR FAQ's, Times, Issues Etc.)
Check out the Tips For Sellers category (forum.fiverr.com/c/Fiverr-Tips/tips-for-sellers/l/top/all?order=views <-- with filters applied). You’ll find hundreds of threads offering advice on a variety of things to consider and/or improve. (Note: Not all advice can apply to all gigs or categories. Be sure you check multiple sources as there are some false tips, even among the top threads.)

Yes. At least the views.

It also used to allow you to view 6 months of data but now it only shows a max of 2 months. They did say something like “your stats are being calculated as normal” when it showed them as “N/A” but they still aren’t able to show the full stats since the “N/A” started.

Guys, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again… Impressions are NOT a good way to determine the success of your gig. We all know by now that there is a Fiverr bug that has erased the impressions listed for your gigs (yes, Fiverr knows about it, and is working on it). Please be patient, and please stop complaining about it. Stop responding as if the sky is falling, or the world has come to an end. Impressions say very little about the success of your gig. In fact, when it comes to success, …

It is probable that an outside force has caused you to not get as many sales. What is also probable is that you have no control over this “outside force”.

The guests and topics are so helpful. By listening to the older episodes you can really see how Fiverr has developed over the years.
The last episode was in 2017. My favorite interview was the person in Fiverr responsible for SEO. His info was extremely helpful.
I realize how much work it probably is to create and maintain a podcast but it’s such a great podcast. I think sound options have improved since then but the topics are spot on! It doesn’t feel like an advertisement. It feels pretty authentic.
So my rant is to bring back Fiverrcast!!! We need you!",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-05 22:43:59.609146

I have just launched my new gig related to Facebook ads designing. And, my gig is not performing well as I expected it to perform.
Basically I am a seller that provides content writing on Men’s fashion and style and I recently hired some people to work on ad designing.
So my questions are:-
Should I Operate both gigs with same profile? As content writing and designing are very different gigs in nature.
Any change I should make in my gig, as I am new in social media ad designing and don’t know much about setting up the gig.
Also, I am going to move on Level-1 this month so should I wait till then to see a spike in my gig analytics?
Answers to above questions and any other suggestion would be welcomed.
Thank you, everyone.
Stay safe.

Yes, and your order gets canceled, their account is automatically disabled. But they can create a new one.
debodutta420:
How does having fast delivery affect this situation?
Well, they targeted only fast deliveries. In my case, I offered fast delivery only for my $5 gig, so people can get it in a day instead of 2 days. However… these scammers purchased $20 worth of content even if the fast delivery is only for $5. So they forced me to do more work for a faster delivery. Since I had surgery and dealt with multiple cancellations, I was forced to basically do the work just to avoid yet another cancellation.
The next day after delivery, they came and asked for a cancellation, without showing any proof. They told me to either cancel the order or I will get a 1-star review because the content is copyrighted. When I told them I will go to customer support, they saw that I won’t refund, so they filed for a PayPal dispute and Fiverr accepts those automatically.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 9:03 am",2020-08-05 22:44:37.564202

They didn’t respond to my mail and I once checked the status they were also stated as solved. What should I do now ? It’s too discouraging!
Any help will be appreciated.

I said this in different posts before, but from my personal experience, I usually get paid once a month, and the only time I got paid right away was something like baby/dog sitting. 2 weeks is extremely short compared to a whole month, so I don’t think there really isn’t much to complain.

True, we always do run into emergency situations where we suddenly need money.
It has happened to me before and in fact I’m sure we all have.
Having that said though, I think it is more important and realistic to focus more on having a decent amount saved and untouched on the side rather than complaining about Fiverr’s rules.",N/A,"Nov 20, 2019 10:16 am",2020-08-05 22:45:19.090744

Fiverr TOS that it is going to take 2 weeks, and the moment you decided to create a gig, that meant that you agree with that rule.
No one here is trying to say that we don’t agree to the rule of 14 days clearance. Instead, we are trying to keep a healthy discussion on the topic so we get to know different opinions on the 14 days clearance.
zeus777:
I think it is more important and realistic to focus more on having a decent amount saved and untouched on the side rather than complaining about Fiverr’s rules.
No one is complaining @zeus777
Upgrading the system is a positive gesture like earlier when withdrawing revenues to bank accounts Fiverr did deduct $1 or $3 as per your choice but now it doesn’t. Earlier withdrawing to account takes one or two days now it takes a few minutes.
In the same way, we are expecting an upgrade in the clearance system also. When the rules are decided it never means that they will not be upgraded to improve user experience.",N/A,"Nov 20, 2019 11:09 am",2020-08-05 22:45:19.484904

That’s like having a regular job and getting paid twice a month. I have no problem with it. If you get orders on regular basis, you stop noticing the clearing period, as long as you don’t spend everything you’ve withdrawn at once.

Fiverr Ambassador",6,"When Fiverr was first launched, it was 14 days for everyone. It was 14 days to try and mitigate risk of chargebacks and other frauds.
PayPal would allow users to perform chargebacks up to 60 days. Fiverr knew 60 day withdrawals weren’t a viable option so offered 14 - under the assumption that any order issues after completion (which can take 3 days - so 17 days total), would likely rear their head within the 14-17 day period. If an issue did occur, Fiverr still has the funds to decide what to do.
As TRS were consistent sellers and frequently have orders and money going into their account, this risk is much lower (i.e. if a chargeback did happen, we will likely replenish our balance with other orders so Fiverr isn’t out of pocket etc). As a TRS you are also a proven seller and less likely to be fraudulent yourself.
If Fiverr had a one day clearing period it could easily be abused. Scammers could come on and place an order with a stolen credit card to any old account they owned on Fiverr - mark it as complete and withdraw the money. This obviously wouldn’t be good.
I personally think withdrawals should be based on a trust metric - such as time since last chargeback, completed orders, order cancellations etc and be reduced based on that - rather than seller level rating.
It’s also worth nothing that since Fiverr was launched, PayPal now allows chargebacks up to 180 days since purchase.",N/A,"Nov 22, 2019 9:59 am",2020-08-05 22:45:23.635061

The structure is a reward system for top tier Sellers. An incentive for Sellers to climb the freelancing ladder. I’m not going to twiddle my thumbs and play with my hair worrying about something I have ZERO control over. My focus is on finishing up the semester with a bang.
I’m curious when you were a TRS, did you feel the same way? Did you want your money faster than (7) days?
fastcopywriter:
If people liked waiting for their money, why does Uber and Lyft offer instant payments, sometimes several times a day? Doordash deposits your earnings on Mondays, until you have driven enough, then you can collect them anytime you want.
Comparing Fiverr to Uber & Lyft is like comparing Barney the purple dinosaur to Ironman. The pay structure for those gig/ridesharing economy companies are convenient, yes. Do I see Fiverr taking on the same structure? Absolutely Not! But if you feel strongly about it, maybe join the OP in his fight with an appeal.",N/A,"Nov 22, 2019 1:14 pm",2020-08-05 22:45:24.837302

Fiverr Ambassador",2,"I wouldn’t say futile, rather just outdated based on it’s original inception. I think there should still be a delay but base it on a trust metric.
For example, PayPal have recently launched “Funds Now”, which means (if you are approved), your account balance is always available - even during a chargeback. If you are not approved and your account has a dispute filed against it, it is often frozen/paused until the funds are added in. Fiverr could have a similar system in terms of trust. It would be great to see 14 days being the max but “trust tiers”, such as 10 days, 7, 5 & 3. That would really give sellers something to aim for outside of levels alone.",N/A,"Nov 22, 2019 3:32 pm",2020-08-05 22:45:25.216659

This is why people shouldn’t put all their eggs & rabbits into one basket.

nikavoice:
The structure is a reward system for top tier Sellers. An incentive for Sellers to climb the freelancing ladder.
Uber has rewards for gold, platinum, etc. However, we all get paid either once a week or as soon as we solicit the money. That encourages people with financial emergencies to drive. Fiverr doesn’t offer such encouragement. By delaying gratification (getting paid), they delay interest on Fiverr.
nikavoice:
I’m curious when you were a TRS, did you feel the same way? Did you want your money faster than (7) days?
Sometimes I did, although getting paid in 7 days was fantastic, you can relax and the money clears very fast. 14 days feels like a lifetime.
I’m just glad I have credit cards, so if I have a financial emergency, I don’t need to get my Fiverr money right away, but what about others who lack credit cards? What do they do?

Right! Which is a fantastic feature even if it has a fee. I like your trust metric idea, why not reward level 2 sellers with funds now? That would be great. Heck, charge a fee!

I guess this is the best way to describe it, but again, personally I never felt/thought
anything about the 2 weeks period thingy. I simply accepted it as one of Fiverr’s rules, whatever the reason was behind the time period. I guess I was too used to the “getting paid once a month” situation. Getting your money in one week is very nice, but for me the most important thing is I DO get paid, and I’m quite grateful to have a job that provides me with that money.
I get it though, sometimes you just want something as soon as possible. Just because I don’t think it’s a problem doesn’t mean everyone else is cool with it.
I never thought the 2 week period was a problem and I never questioned it, but back then it did take a bit for me to get over the “Fiverr takes 20% away, even the tips” system.
Thankfully I’m over it now.",N/A,"Nov 23, 2019 2:15 am",2020-08-05 22:45:26.485431

think twice about complaining for a period of 14 days only!
If you think asking for an update for a better experience is complaining then we are doing so.
Earlier Fiverr do deduct $1 when you transfer your revenues from Fiverr to Payoneer in 3 days & $3 for 1 day transfer . But now they have updated the system & all the transactions from Fiverr to Payoneer are free & we receive them in minutes.
If Fiverr will be as like you that don’t think of an innovation or improvement in the system then they will be left with $1 & $3 deductions like earlier. They found that if we reduce the time & fee we can make the experience of revenues much better.
They are in competition with many freelancing websites from which I find Fiverr as the best. To keep themself in the game it is necessary for them to make updates & keep themself out of the box.
I understand many of you don’t have a problem with 14 days clearance maybe because you guys accept the things & just go with the flow.
I’m not saying I don’t accept this 14 days clearance but an update can make it better.

Fiverr is providing the same safety and security to Top Rater Sellers in 7 days which I appreciate to give them Royal exception because of a long long journey they have gone through.

In regular job, at end of the month I have the assurity that I will get paid with a fixed salary as decided. But on Fiverr I have faced this situation thrice that in whole month I got zero order but in the last week I get $200-300 order which is very good but I have to wait for fourteen days to get my revenues & when I will receive them half of the month will be gone.
In that half month I have to spend my savings which I hate the most. Because of that I feel annoyed of fourteen days clearance. And there is nothing wrong in going for an upgrade in the system.
I hope I have cleared my point.",N/A,"Nov 23, 2019 7:35 am",2020-08-05 22:45:29.948205

My name is Awais & I’m catering here the services on Fiverr for more than one & a half years.
Through this long journey, I have found many improvements that can be made to make the platform more effective like adding a voice note feature to chat & many more.
The one I’m a bit frustrated with is 14 days clearance. This time frame can be reduced to 7 days like Top Rated Sellers & for Top Rated Sellers maybe reduce it to 3 days.

Generally I am not against “the better”
I am just considering all what Fiverr offers to sellers and I find the 14 days period normal considering what happens in the marketplace, in the whole world. Of course, if one thinks that one can make much better elsewhere, one is always free to go for it.
I think it is good though to feel grateful from time to time.

Regular",1,"That’s a good question, and I’m sorry you hadn’t received any feedback on it before now. I’ll admit I don’t have anything in the ‘writing’ category, but this is something I’ve pondered. How much of it is the Fiverr marketplace? How does that reflect on actual demand? Which is the better market segment to pursue? Is Fiverr too mired in short and shallow services in the writing category?

One is for ghostwriting…with the intention of serving long-written books or novels,
You could split it into chapters or a certain number of chapters so it’s not a full novel or non-fiction book in one order. Maybe showing your different prices for different things (eg. type/genre of book, length of book) might help or creating packages for different lengths of book/different word counts.
I think in Fiverr stats & evaluations that shorter duration services are better, in that the stats would be less negatively affected by a cancellation etc. if you’re getting a lot of other orders rather than a low number of big orders.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 10:39 am",2020-08-05 22:45:36.168363

I have been mostly successful with it however, I have noticed lately that I seem to be getting a lot of buyers that are largely unresponsive. There’s been a noticeable uptick in this. I offer website and social media services so at times, I require the buyer to be a little more responsive–such as if I need access to a social media account and I need them to send me the security verification code that is provided to them by e-mail or text message since those are generally not something I have access to myself. If these buyers don’t provide this information, it is impossible for me to complete the work due to their non responsiveness. The clock ticks down and I end up getting a black mark against my account in the form of my 100% rating dropping for something that was not my fault.
Does Fiverr offer some sort of mechanism to pause the clock until the buyer provides the necessary information and that is confirmed by the seller? How do I prevent a job from going against my ratings if the time allotted is up and the buyer still hasn’t provided the necessary information to do the job?

My gigs are pretty specific though…and especially when I require login credentials and either don’t get them because the buyer put something different in that space OR they put incorrect information that doesn’t work in that space.—that’s an issue too.

No it isn’t at all.
And if all you’re doing is posting your gig link with a call to action and hashtags, you’re going to attract scammers because they know you’re desperate and that you don’t understand marketing.
Promotion doesn’t mean just posting your gig repeatedly.
Social media marketing can only help you sell if you’re sharing insights and understand how social converts into buyers. No one who promotes as you describe understands that. They just post their gig and tell people to buy it. That never makes someone successful.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 7:10 am",2020-08-05 22:47:07.722342

Paypal has clearly stated that
"" If you are registered for GST, it is important that you update your GSTIN details with us at the earliest.""
There is an “If” there and that so very obviously means that “if” you are not registered for GST, then Paypal understands that you need not register for GST and hence need not update a GST number.
In other words, as far as Paypal states, those registered with GST, please update your GST Regn Nr and those who do not register their GST Regn Nr, Paypal understands that those people or companies need not register for GST Regn Nr.
It is the same (in India) with all services that issue you an invoice : IF you are registered in GST, please update your GST Regn Nr.
So simple. Where is the confusion ? There is no confusion.",N/A,"Oct 31, 2017 8:22 am",2020-08-05 22:47:21.745318

We have updated our UA to comply with local laws applicable to Indian companies including local taxation laws.

Please consult your tax advisors in terms of your eligibility for refunds.
So the GST requirement is for Paypal to charge 18% from users.

No, the love making money – as any business does. But they do not guarantee that sellers will have their gigs featured where they want in the search results. The algorithm treats all gigs the same. Those that perform well usually rise to the top of the listings.

I mean, marketing. Promotion. Who are your target customers? Go to wherever they are located, show them how you can solve their needs, and then convince them to hire you.
I would guess that you’ve only been trying to make your gigs look good here on Fiverr, and that you haven’t done anything to market or promote anywhere else (wherever your target customers are located).

Fiverr has so many sellers that it is oversaturated in many areas. So to be fair, they move gig positions around. Even TRSs and Pro sellers have experienced loss in their placement as @frank_d has said above.

That is irrelevant. I can easily type anyone’s username into the Fiverr profile page url, and their profile shows up. Nothing shows up when I do this for you.

You do know that you don’t need to be a seller or buyer to have a forum account?
I see. So, you weren’t being truthful… and you really don’t have an account on Fiverr? If you’re not a seller on Fiverr, you aren’t someone who should be giving seller advice – especially since your “advice” is terrible advice, and should never be followed by sellers here on Fiverr.

It is against the rules of Fiverr to have more than one account – regardless of the reasons you have given. I’m pretty sure the same applies to the forum. In the past, the mods have removed forum access to user accounts that are not connected to an active Fiverr account.

(But never deliver nothing) The faster you deliver, the more the buyer will like it. But rushing a delivery might reduce your service quality, and the goal is to make the buyer love whatever they purchased. So always take your time to perfect whatever you are selling before delivering it, if possible.

You’re okay with defrauding people? You provide them targeted work (samples or otherwise), some of which they will likely use in their own businesses, and then you turn around and sell that same targeted work to someone else? What if someone chooses to take legal action against you because they see work you did for them, even if for free, on someone else’s website?

No.
This is Fiverr’s company and site. You don’t get to make your own terms of service.
Second, even if someone agreed to that and fully understood the ramifications of that, that doesn’t make it right.
When someone commissions you, they’re giving you their ideas and direction. So you’re taking their ideas and business direction and selling them, not just the product you made.
In any case, nothing you’re describing is an effective business model. No one becomes successful by doing half a commission without ensuring payment and no true professional would hire someone who values their work that way.",N/A,"Jul 16, 2020 5:40 am",2020-08-05 22:49:09.554717

he came back with another order (Let’s say O2) now. Considering the last issue, I didn’t charge him a high price.

They might be able to help better with this. Especially since he’s threatening you.
Yes he/anyone could probably could do legal action outside of Fiverr but like has been suggested it was probably just a threat And it was his fault for not checking/doing a test before the full print. And he accepted the terms that included “no warranties” etc…
Also if he’s threatening he should be reported I think (that’s against the TOS I think, as well as asking for payment outside Fiverr is also against the TOS).",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 4:02 am",2020-08-05 22:49:31.411410

I have an issue to be solved by the Fiverr. I had one order (let’s say O1)with the customer. In this order, I had delivered the file and he gave me 5 stars for the service. After some time he came back and told that product design defected (Mirrored wrongly) and he got that design printed already(he ordered print more than 20,000 pieces without checking the design on printing). I apologize, corrected the design, offered him a discount on the next design then.
he came back with another order (Let’s say O2) now. Considering the last issue, I didn’t charge him a high price. I made the minimal design with an already existing logo and it doesn’t match his expectation. He got angry and refused to proceed with this order.

He informed me that he is going to hire a lawyer for compensation of the O1 from me. I already have accepted the dispute for the second-order O2 and offered the free design for it but he is kind of thretening me by the legal warning.

Buyer already have a chance to see and ask revisions if there are any mistake.
Once they accept the delivery, then the project is final (unless you break TOS by stealling other works)
It’s just a thread…, your buyer won’t sue you …, does he want to waste more time and money again??? If he want to cancel the order, just let him cancel…, you won’t get high rating from him anymore so better to cancel this order.
and once the order is settled…, just block him.

I advice you exercise patience and improve more on your gig. Like @designs_4u1 suggested send buyer request regularly, check out similar services you can offer as well and create more gigs for them; the more services you offer the more exposure you get and you know what that means… I only realized this sooner but I’m currently improving on myself.
Your next sale may be today, tomorrow or never; nobody knows. Just follow the right steps and you’ll be nowhere far away from your first client.
Good luck",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 3:43 am",2020-08-05 22:50:49.695315

After a day or so, the buyer contacted me asked for some revisions in inbox. I did what he was asking and thus he left with a “Thank You”.
Auto completed orders don’t have reviews, so I was really not happy with that experience. Lol

On Tuesday 29 July 2020 I have received three different email from Fiverr at the same time on my previous main account
The first email said there was an issue with my Fiverr account it was flagged. This is was my first warning.
The second email explained that my gig was removed.
The last email said my Fiverr account has been permanently disabled
As I said I have received them with a short notice not to mention it was a first warning. This is happened because someone who I had a disagreement with (NOT ON FIVERR) reported me for something I did not do,
In other words I was not given any chance to defend my case.
Apparently it was flagged for violations of Intellectual Property and third party’s Terms of Service.
This is wrong, because I have always respected and adhere completely to terms of service with Proof.
I’ve always had good review, I was using my own ressource.
On Monday 28 July 2020 I have left a review and commentary for this particular product which I bought in here
CodeCanyon 1
Grocery, Food, Pharmacy, Store Delivery Mobile App with Admin Panel 1
– Version: 1.5.0 – Last update: 14/06/2020 – File Included: Full Source code of Flutter App (Android & iOS) with PHP Admin Panel CONSIDERING PURCHASING OUR ITEM? Please v...
Price: $59 USD
My commentary included my Fiverr Profile to offer my service to fix bugs and adding new features for this product.
That’s how the author got my Fiverr Profile.
Following my review the author did three things :
1 )Reported my Envato codecanyon wich resulted on my account being locked
2)Reported me on my Fiverr account which resulted on my account being disabled for something I did not do !
3) They also sent me a threat email on my gmail account in my own language
Here is the translation of this email :
“Good bye retard there is only you left send me your location if you’re a man or I’m I wrong.”
Note : this person is from the same country as me.
You will find below the Screenshot as proof for what I just said, unfortunately I do not know the username Fiverr account of the person who reported me but here is the link of their Envato Profile Account if it help :

Thankfully I managed to retrieve my Envato account thanks to the support and now I’m currently trying to get a refund for their awful product who was not as described no support, no updates, a lot of bugs, security leak …
How do I get justice ?

Well, if you think you can prove to support that you didn’t do what you said you were reported for and didn’t do, and didn’t violate any of Fiverr’s nor any third party’s terms of service, you could try by writing them an email, not by creating new accounts after having been permanently banned and adding a(nother) terms violation thus. It’s pretty easy to find the contact email by googling, but it’s support @ fiverr.com
“Previous main account” is already a bad omen, as you’re not supposed to have a main and other accounts, just one account, full stop. Maybe best to delete this (and any potential other) side account/s/current main account/s before appealing to them about your previous main account.
Make sure you really didn’t violate any other party’s licensing terms or such first, in any case, to not waste your or other people’s time.
chikouzak:
not to mention it was a first warning
That doesn’t mean anything. I don’t know why people keep perpetuating, or even relying on, the completely wrong notion that one would only ever get banned after two or three warnings. Nobody is guaranteed any number of warnings before serious action is taken;
examples from the ToS:
“Rude, abusive, improper language, or violent messages will not be tolerated and may result in an account warning or the suspension/removal of your account.”
Nothing like “You may be rude two times and we’ll only ban you after the third time” there, you may or may not get a warning, or your account may or may not be suspended.
“Warnings do not limit account activity, but can lead to your account losing Seller statuses or becoming permanently disabled based on the severity of the violation.”
Again, nothing about a specific number of warnings, and the wording certainly suggests to me that, depending on the severity of the violation, you can be out on your first violation.
“Fiverr reserves the right to put any account on hold or permanently disable accounts due to breach of these Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards or due to any illegal or inappropriate use of the Site or services.”
Again, nothing about “after one/two/three/however many warnings” = they might disable accounts right away.
Fiverr reserves the right to act as they see fit. Sorry about stressing this point, but it’s my forum pet peeve; too many people, for whatever reason, think and make others think that they can violate the terms happily at least two if not three times before anything serious might happen, as this is not the case.
That said, I agree that users should be given a chance to defend themselves if someone accuses them of whatever, unless maybe it’s absolutely crystal clear that they did indeed violate the terms and Fiverr considers it a big enough violation to use the ban hammer (from reading the forum, and the internet at large, I guess it’s possible that they don’t have the time to spend on discussing the probably many clear violations). Good luck!",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 8:13 pm",2020-08-05 22:52:29.934395

On Tuesday 29 July 2020 I have received three different email from Fiverr at the same time on my previous main account
The first email said there was an issue with my Fiverr account it was flagged. This is was my first warning.
The second email explained that my gig was removed.
The last email said my Fiverr account has been permanently disabled
As I said I have received them with a short notice not to mention it was a first warning. This is happened because someone who I had a disagreement with (NOT ON FIVERR) reported me for something I did not do,
In other words I was not given any chance to defend my case.
Apparently it was flagged for violations of Intellectual Property and third party’s Terms of Service.
This is wrong, because I have always respected and adhere completely to terms of service with Proof.
I’ve always had good review, I was using my own ressource.
On Monday 28 July 2020 I have left a review and commentary for this particular product which I bought in here
CodeCanyon 1
Grocery, Food, Pharmacy, Store Delivery Mobile App with Admin Panel 1
– Version: 1.5.0 – Last update: 14/06/2020 – File Included: Full Source code of Flutter App (Android & iOS) with PHP Admin Panel CONSIDERING PURCHASING OUR ITEM? Please v...
Price: $59 USD
My commentary included my Fiverr Profile to offer my service to fix bugs and adding new features for this product.
That’s how the author got my Fiverr Profile.
Following my review the author did three things :
1 )Reported my Envato codecanyon wich resulted on my account being locked
2)Reported me on my Fiverr account which resulted on my account being disabled for something I did not do !
3) They also sent me a threat email on my gmail account in my own language
Here is the translation of this email :
“Good bye retard there is only you left send me your location if you’re a man or I’m I wrong.”
Note : this person is from the same country as me.
You will find below the Screenshot as proof for what I just said, unfortunately I do not know the username Fiverr account of the person who reported me but here is the link of their Envato Profile Account if it help :

Thankfully I managed to retrieve my Envato account thanks to the support and now I’m currently trying to get a refund for their awful product who was not as described no support, no updates, a lot of bugs, security leak …
How do I get justice ?

Do You Work With Buyers Who Don’t Read Your Gig Page?,"Your Fiverr Experience

This happened a couple weeks ago, but I keep thinking about it, and I thought I’d ask if others have done the same.
I provide copyediting and proofreading services. For my proofreading service, in the gig description, I don’t ask that anyone contacts me beforehand. Anyone can just order from that gig because it’ll likely be around 3k words and that’s nothing.
But for my copyediting gig, it is specifically for fiction novels. I usually get orders that are at least 70k words, and I like to be able to put as much focus on one, max two, at a time because of the varying levels of editing needs for the manuscript. In my gig description, it’s impossible to miss the part where I say the buyer needs to contact me and I need to see the manuscript (or at least some of it) to determine how heavy the copyedit will be. It’s highlighted and in bold.
One morning, I woke up to see that an order had been started on my fiction novel gig. I was already in the middle of editing a 160k-word novel and just starting another smaller one, so seeing that someone had not only gone through my gig and submitted their requirements but had also not even sent me a measly message—man, I was pissed. I had to cancel the order, citing the fact that I had requirements the buyer looked over or ignored. So, of course, it hurt my cancellation rate. I didn’t even bother trying to set up something to work with the buyer after that either, because I don’t want to work with someone who can’t even have enough respect to listen.
I just think it’s incredibly frustrating when buyers can’t even be bothered to read the gig page. I’ve now edited my Requirements section to include a message that states that we’ve already discussed the terms, and if they haven’t, they must cancel the order.
I just ask that buyers actually read the gig page. It’s not there as a backdrop. And it’s especially disappointing when it’s a fellow writer doing it. They should be most in-tune to details when it comes to reading.

Regular",5,"I am sorry to hear about your experience, and I agree that it sucks when buyers don’t bother to read the gig page. I don’t get why a buyer wouldn’t take the time to read it. It is like signing a contract without reading it first, but I guess people do that too.
I often have people order directly without contacting me. For my translation gig, I don’t require that buyers contact me first, so I am okay with that. I have had a few people who sent more words than was included in their package, though. I don’t know if it is ignorance or if they are just trying to scam me. If I had to guess, I think it is more likely to be the latter.
But, of course, some gigs do require contact beforehand, so it is perfectly fine to specify it in your gig description.
However, I will suggest that you use the Limit Orders in Queue feature. It might be useful for you. You can see a description of it here: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/limiting-orders-in-queue",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 3:36 pm",2020-08-05 22:52:40.600151

I’ve put my prices up high enough so mostly they don’t order without contacting me first.

Yes, that’s exactly what I’m doing! I think I got the idea from someone here on the forums because they were getting problem buyers. It helps with CS disputes, I’m sure, even if a little bit.

I provide copyediting and proofreading services. For my proofreading service, in the gig description, I don’t ask that anyone contacts me beforehand. Anyone can just order from that gig because it’ll likely be around 3k words and that’s nothing.
But for my copyediting gig, it is specifically for fiction novels. I usually get orders that are at least 70k words, and I like to be able to put as much focus on one, max two, at a time because of the varying levels of editing needs for the manuscript. In my gig description, it’s impossible to miss the part where I say the buyer needs to contact me and I need to see the manuscript (or at least some of it) to determine how heavy the copyedit will be. It’s highlighted and in bold.
One morning, I woke up to see that an order had been started on my fiction novel gig. I was already in the middle of editing a 160k-word novel and just starting another smaller one, so seeing that someone had not only gone through my gig and submitted their requirements but had also not even sent me a measly message—man, I was pissed. I had to cancel the order, citing the fact that I had requirements the buyer looked over or ignored. So, of course, it hurt my cancellation rate. I didn’t even bother trying to set up something to work with the buyer after that either, because I don’t want to work with someone who can’t even have enough respect to listen.
I just think it’s incredibly frustrating when buyers can’t even be bothered to read the gig page. I’ve now edited my Requirements section to include a message that states that we’ve already discussed the terms, and if they haven’t, they must cancel the order.
I just ask that buyers actually read the gig page. It’s not there as a backdrop. And it’s especially disappointing when it’s a fellow writer doing it. They should be most in-tune to details when it comes to reading.

If you think your rates are on the low end anyway, another method might be setting higher prices and smaller word counts for the direct order gigs and writing something like ""contact me for a custom offer for xxxx+ words (choose a word count that typically wouldn’t pose too much trouble if someone orders without contacting you) at a rate of (somewhat cheaper than the direct order gig price as incentive to contact you) under certain conditions (file type, need to see file, whatever fits).",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 10:58 am",2020-08-05 22:52:45.371257

What’s The Difference Between Response Time And Response Rate?
Response Rate is the percentage of first responses to new messages that a seller sends within 24 hours. Response Time is the average amount of time in hours that it takes for a seller to send a first response.
How Does The Response Rate Indicator Work?
It tracks the percentage of first responses sent within 24 hours over the last 60 days.
For example, if you received 10 new requests in your inbox in the last 60 days and replied to 9 of them within 24 hours of receiving each one, your response rate is 90%.
Note: if you reply to the last message more than 24 hours after receiving it, your response rate will still be 90%. We recommend that sellers reply even after 24 hours.
Is Every Inbox Message Factored Into My Response Rate?
The Response Rate Indicator tracks your first response to a new message. After that first reply, the rest of the conversation isn’t tracked, although it is important to continue conversations with Buyers until a conclusion is reached.",N/A,"Jun 18, 2018 6:38 am",2020-08-05 22:53:03.344787

Keep in mind that your percentage is affected by your responses on a “rollover basis” — that means that anyone you responded to 61 days ago, or longer, is no longer affecting your personal response percentage. Thus, it’s possible to lose response percentage without even having received a new message, because your ratio of non response to response was lowered because some of your “quick” responses may have moved outside of the 60 day window. I hope that makes sense and helps. As a side note, one thing that helps me is to check “unread” messages in my inbox when I have a large queue to respond to. This ensures I don’t miss any messages from down the line. I have achieved a 100% response rate, so I’m here to tell you it is possible if you remain diligent.

You don’t get to stay where you are just because of your performance. That’s not how algorithms work and that would be no way for Fiverr to run their business. If you think your performance is the only factor that should affect your ranking, you have a lot to learn. This doesn’t at all account for Fiverr’s business goals or competition in the market either. There’s no scenario that means you stay where you are. That’s not how algorithms work and Fiverr would lose business if they operated that…",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 7:21 pm",2020-08-05 22:53:16.552077

Look at this way. The average human being needs about 8 hours sleep every 24 hours.
Imagine if a message came through the moment you went to sleep, and you replied the moment you woke up - that would be an 8 hour response time.
So, 4 hours is actually good.
As @humanissocial has said, you’re allowed a life. In fact, for once, I would go a step further and say as a freelancer, it is vital that you do have a life - and part of that is not stressing about response times.

We had definitely submitted a request for a revision
It’s not possible for the order to autocomplete if it’s in revision. The site is set up in a way that prevents it from happening.
It’s either that the revision was sent as a comment on the order’s page or in the inbox, thus having no effect on the order status and allowing it to autocomplete. Or the seller delivered incomplete work to “close” the revision request and mark the order as complete.
In any case, it takes CS up to 10 days to respond to a ticket these days. If you have a confirmation from the seller that they’ve seen your message and are working on it and then stopped responding, you have a good chance to get this resolved in your favor.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 5:19 pm",2020-08-05 22:54:11.310632

If you want invoices for purchases prior to filling out your billing information, you will need to fill out a support ticket. Please submit a request (please choose “Order Related - Buyer” and use the Category “Other”) with the following information to help create your invoice:

I think it was the outside of Fiverr bit. I’ve had false positives, but after Trust & Safety reviewed the messages, it was a green light for me. Certain words trigger these warnings like pay, email etc… I wouldn’t worry too much, they’ll see that it was harmless, however moving forward just be extra careful.

Be sure not to include competition sites such as UpWork, Guru, Freelancer, Behance,…and or similar since you will get a warning from Fiverr and get demoted. I got demoted when I first start working on Fiverr, 7 years ago. A client asked me to show him my portfolio and I send him a link from one of the previously mentioned sites. Don’t wanna mention it cos I am afraid of demotion lol It was not Fiverr’s support fault since I was automatically flagged by their system. Also, I was a newbie at that time so I wasn’t aware of Fiverr TOS. Fiverr changed greatly from their beginning and I am sure that they will get even better in future.

I just wanted to ask one question which has raised in my mind out for curiosity. One friend of mine who is also working here on the platform told me a situation. That while discussing projects details with client. Suddenly client offered him to work for him on the project outside of the fiverr. My friend just simple told him that he will not work outside platform. He will only work if the job is from fiverr or Up* ( You know the word). and withing few second he got warning that his message is under review. Will this get him banned on platform ? or there will be few days suspension ? Can you kindly let me know the information. So I can spread the word because he is too much worried. and also in future I will also stay away from this kind of situation.
Thank you for your reply. Please kindly let me know the consequences of the situation. Have a nice day.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2019 7:46 am",2020-08-05 22:55:02.620369

Usually if you write a word or phrase that is not allowed, the text box will turn RED and give you a warning that if you continue and send the message, it may be flagged by their Trust and Safety team. If that happens, you want to ERASE what you have written (backspace) until the red disappears OR use common sense and realize if you mentioned anything that can be seen as going off site, your account will get a warning.
I doubt he will get outright banned, but the warning may stay on his account and if he gets 2 more he may get booted. Getting warnings can also hinder your ability to maintain your Level or Level up as well.

So a costumer asked me if freelancing is my full time job. I said yes and that I also have clients outside of Fiverr that I provide with web design services.
Client’s Question: Haha okay! So are you doing instagram and freelancing full time or just on the side?
My Answer: Full time. I also have clients outside of Fiverr that I provide with web design services.
Immediately I received this warning from Fiverr: ‘Your message was flagged for review by our Trust and Safety team, due to possible Terms of Service violation. This process may take up to 24 hours.’
Could this actually ban my account and was my answer somehow against TOS?
I am a bit confused by what that means and what could happen to my account.

Only way to know if he got banned permanently is to ask Fiverr support or trying to log into the account to find it is has been deleted/suspended etc.

I am currently enrolled in an SEO training class and I want to add value to my gigs by taking the SEO skills test to become a better seller on Fiverr.
There is no SEO skill test showing on my profile, I have taken other tests related to my gig and they turned out very well. I wonder why am I not seeing the test on my profile, has it been taken off permanently, or are there any other factors that I should be considering.

You won’t get a TRS status unless Fiverr believes your work is great. Bashing them on the forum won’t help your cause.
I was TRS for 5 years after losing it due to health issues one month. Honestly there’s no real difference, aside from the fact that you get your money faster. But if you have a constant flux of orders, you won’t even feel any difference. Other than that, faster customer support replies and a few other perks that you may never use.

If the top seller is choose by the fiverr itself then why they didn’t mentioned it anywhere on their analytics page?
And what is the criteria to judge that. And does that mean I not a original seller?
My gig’s are well presented, even every buyer of mine gave me 5 star rating even I have buyers who have taken the service from me more than 10 times.
And I did a search for the other top Rated seller to see what their professional gigs look like. And there was no difference even they are selling the same service thrice the price of mine. And you gave them Top Rated Seller batch.
And that isn’t the point why it is not mentioned anywhere? Am I stupid who’s been doing so much hard work even I managed to fulfil all these criteria in just 7-8 months.
This is pure fraud with sellers.
Fiverr just try to motivate their sellers at first by showing all these on their Analytics page and when they work hard to achieve this, this is what the do.

The manual process for TRS isn’t a check box exercise as far as I can gather. They’re looking through your inbox, order pages, how well you convert, what happens when you get rotated out … and a great many other secret things that we mere sellers cannot imagine.

One month and a half ago I’ve been contacted from the Fiverr editorial team directly in Fiverr via chat from a user named “editor_picks”. They have basically offered me the chance to apply to the new Fiverr business. Here below part of the message (I didn’t include the interview questions):
> Because of your professionalism and skills we want to introduce Fiverr Business - a new environment built for bigger businesses and companies on Fiverr. This is an interesting opportunity to work with bigger clients, leverage your expertise, and gain all the benefits that come with it. Fiverr Business is focused on business-related services and we are building a dedicated business catalog for Fiverr Business companies to choose from. In order for us to better understand your professional match and eligibility, we’d like to ask that you answer the following questions on video:
The also said to look out for an email to gain more information about this opportunity. I never received this email and asked them why I didn’t received it but it seems they didn’t care too much. I then asked to prove their profile, I really didn’t want to send this video to a stranger.
Once they have proofed it, I decided then to go ahead and prepare the video for them (even though the only information I had were what I attached above, not very clear) and sent everything to them.
Once they have received the video, their answers was “great, thank you!” nothing else, they didn’t let me know what was next until I asked them. They then said “We will review your video, and you will be contacted via email later on with further information.” Then 1 week after they have said it would had take few weeks to get a result.
I then decided to wait, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, and nothing. No email, no messages. I sent another message asking what was happening, if they had any news and how long would take roughly to receive a result, but they didn’t reply to me anymore.
The reason why I’m writing this is because I wanted to know if this happened to anyone already and if the fiver editorial team had the same attitude. The only thing that annoys me most is that I wasted half day to make this video even though were 3/4 minutes but I really thought this was a good occasion to grow in Fiverr and wanted to do good. At the end, my feeling is that Fiverr Editorial didn’t care too much and just wanted to receive my video for some reasons, they didn’t get back to me with a yes or a no! Does it really take so long to review a 3 minutes video? Did this happened to any of you already?",N/A,N/A,N/A,"catwriter
Regular",1,"mattdesigner:
Does it really take so long to review a 3 minutes video?
One video, no, but how many sellers have they contacted? How many videos they need to review, and then choose the best candidates?
(Just guessing here, of course, but it seems logical; remember that it took them months to review Pro applications)",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 1:46 pm",2020-08-05 22:56:30.892136

Then why did he said that i will pay outside the platform. What should i do now ? Should i ask him to pay outside the platform?
What would i get ? A banned account due to TOS. We sellers cannot ask for anything! This is a big flaw.
The flaw here unfortunately is that you provided him the work before he placed an order with you.
Regrettably, I agree with what invaderroxas said earlier -
invaderroxas:
There is no reasonable situation where you do the work first, then have payment process afterwards. That is not how Fiverr works, and I would take this as a lesson moving forward

The best advice would be to not use canned responses and write the offer yourself, to sound like it was meant for that buyer alone and not a general offer you copy-paste. But! (ofc there’s a but) If you do that, you will sometimes end up writing your offer and the moment you click the send button, it will say in red “Oops, something went wrong. Try again (or something)” That’s when he can’t receive more offers and it’s gone. So maybe try to write some part of the offer yourself (maybe the beginning) and continue with the copy-paste to fill in your expertise, what you offer and your portfolio, if you have/need one.

Your argument also doesn’t mean more time on Fiverr equals a greater likelihood of orders just like ordering more lottery tickets doesnt make it more likely you will win.
Buyers want what they want and you being online a lot doesn’t change that, especially if thousands of other sellers are also trying to stay online.
And I don’t understand how you can tell people this is how it is if you have little experience selling here. Regardless, your logic doesn’t work.
People would sell things if they learned their market and designed gigs around that instead of doing these silly tricks.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 3:11 am",2020-08-05 22:58:19.354519

The exact amounts that they have offered or more/less?
Usually offer <= the budget amount. It depends on the request. If you think they’re asking too much work for the budget specified you could make an offer for higher than it.
It depends what is written in the request/how it is written. The higher the budget they put, the more you could maybe put a lower offer. It might depend on how easily (how much work is involved) you could do what they are asking, etc. But some buyers might think too low an offer is not serious.
Another issue is you can’t (shouldn’t) create an offer for a higher price than your gig price if you’re not offering more things in the offer than they’d get in your gig by buying it directly.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 8:56 am",2020-08-05 22:58:40.332901

If the buyer’s amount is ridiculously low, don’t bid. They aren’t serious and will treat you like garbage. It won’t be worth your time. Good chance they’re cancel on you.
If the price point is reasonable, then charge them what you think it’s worth. If it should be a bit more, charge that and explain it. If it’s slightly less, then charge that.
As a buyer, I find it disingenuous when sellers bid the exact amount. What are the chances? When I click on the gig, almost all of them are charging up to $60 LESS.
Why would I pay $60 more when I can order straight from their gig page. I find that to be dishonest.
Before someone says, maybe its because I’m asking more than their gig, I’m not. “I need a 500 word article on xyz.” Pretty straight forward.
Whatever you charge is what you get. Example, if you charge $100:
Buyer pays: $100 + $5 (processing) = $105.
Seller gets: $100 - $20 (seller fee) = $80.
Fiver gets: $5 (processing) + $20 (seller fee) = $25.
You have to convert if you don’t use U.S. currency.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 9:58 am",2020-08-05 22:58:40.728743

So I asked customer support to cancel the order from their side, as it is effecting my completion rate. But here’s how their services work, I requested them to cancel the order when it was only 2-3 days late, and now it’s been 18 days I haven’t received any reply from them, All I got was the automated reply that they some of their support member will reply to my query within 10 days. I waited and now that I see they marked the support ticked as solved. How??
My order is still late, they buyers doesn’t cares because they have nothing to lose but my whole profile is getting affected. How can the fiverr Support mark them as solved when they didn’t even replied to my request. And now i can’t reply on the same ticket as it has been solved according to them.
So I opened another ticket and 2 days later after my 2 messages I got automated reply that my query that they will response in 10 business days, are you really kidding me, My order is already 18 days late and I should wait again for 10 days and no idea they will response or not just like they did to my previous request.
Fiverr customer support is the worst, Their services are getting worst day by day. Here we are doing are 100% to grow our account and this is the service they provide to their seller.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-05 22:58:59.748061

Longer answer: thousands of new users have signed up to Fiverr because the pandemic has made their usual sources of income dry up.
They don’t understand that Fiverr isn’t an employer and that messaging other sellers for work is totally unacceptable.
Like most floods, all we can do is wait for the waters to receed. Which they will. Eventually.
Most of the new sellers will never get an order, mainly because they make absolutely no effort on their own behalf … unfortunate, but true …",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 8:39 am",2020-08-05 22:59:12.855233

I’d bet money that whenever this is happening to you, your demo is one of many that the client has collected to send to their client to audition. Their client picks their favourite, informs your buyer, and your buyer engages that seller. If they’re professional, they might come back and let you know that your demo wasn’t picked, but most don’t.
We’ve actually had to block someone recently, as we realised they’d asked for a demo 8 times over the past couple of years, but never actually bought anything.

Please tell me what can I do, I’m not sure about editing the gig because I think maybe I’ve lost my existing position.
I hope you guys help me out

To be fair, if I, as a buyer, would have managed to place an order by mistake, I’d be okay with waiting a few days for support to cancel, but the decision whether to just cancel and be done with it, or to ask support to cancel, and tell your customer by mistake that you declined the cancellation request to let support cancel it and refund them, is up to you.
Whatever you do, I’d avoid in any case to tell the buyer anything like “my rating will go down”, etc.; if you can’t deal with this issue without any of that, it’s definitely better to cancel and hope that support will correct your order completion rate later when they get around to your ticket, or to take the hit, if they won’t.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 7:14 am",2020-08-05 23:00:23.467974

You could ask if they can enter a different payment method in case that would work. If you don’t dispute the cancellation it might cancel in 2 days and it might be too late for CS to do anything about it given their long response times currently. You could accept the dispute but that would mean CS would probably not be able to do anything about it and it would affect your stats.
So ideally get CS to cancel it without it affecting your stats due to it not being your fault but they may or may not do it and it may be too late to do it with their current response time.
So maybe try and get them to do a different payment method and try and get CS to cancel it without affecting your stats if that doesn’t work. But it might be too late unless you decline the cancellation one or more times.

Ive never had such a high fee when converting currency but perhaps you’re correct - though this is outlandish to say the least. I didnt get round to making some snaps of it as I had a few urgent orders to take care of, but the amount is less missing than initially thought. To clarify, the amount on the top of my screen before withdrawing was 119GBP, after withdrawing I received 102GBP. I’m not sure where that cash went, but it’s whatever. I’m expecting to be able to withdraw again tomorrow, so I’ll see what the difference is and get in touch with CS. Thanks everyone",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 9:05 pm",2020-08-05 23:01:24.207362

Can you please share your experience as a seller on fiverr. What should someone do to get orders regularly?
Thanks for the quote. To be honest I am not sure how am I so lucky that once my order luck got opened it never stopped for even a single day. There might be two reasons, I guess. Firstly, my gigs are performing good because of search engine optimization that I researched for almost a month about the fiverr marketplace and its gig algorithm. And secondly Though I have 5 gigs, I got most of the orders on my Online Course Curriculum and Course Content Development gigs (as I am an online course developer) that is trending worldwide. But to my surprise I found a few competitor in my category, But good news for me is that there are thousands of buyers who are in search of online course developer. And that market gap is still bringing my fortune.
Apart from that, I trry to be online as many hours as possible, remain communicative and decent at a time while dealing buyers and obviously deliver original and quality content within the deadline. Thats a brief about my journey. Hope that helps.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 10:38 am",2020-08-05 23:02:19.213371

arnukas:
Could the order be marked as Very Late while the cancellation is in dispute?
I guess that could happen with support’s current response times.
The 1* standard review one sometimes sees on profiles (Order was cancelled, seller didn’t deliver on time) isn’t automatic in so far as the buyer has to cancel for it to happen but it’s automatic in so far that the buyer can’t do anything against that review happening if they cancel.
Your buyer will get the option to cancel one-sidedly once the order gets in “Very Late” status, and then, if they cancel, the “automatic” 1* review happens. I’ve had that situation once, when I made an order and the seller apparently had abandoned their account, never delivered nor reacted to messages, so finally, I cancelled to get my money refunded. I wouldn’t even have wanted to leave a review, because I didn’t know if maybe the seller had gone or been taken to a hospital, or something similar or worse happened, but when I cancelled, that review happened, I couldn’t choose if or how to review.
If he doesn’t accept your cancellation request, there’s not much reason for him to cancel when the order goes very late either, but you never know, of course, maybe he knows that buyers typically can’t leave a review when orders get cancelled but that that automatic review will happen if the order gets very late, or he could change his mind.
arnukas:
But I also afraid that he would reject the cancellation request.
I think if the buyer neither accepts not declines your cancellation request within some time frame, the order will automatically be cancelled? And if he’d reject, I think you could send a new request? So that specific thing doesn’t seem to be anything to be much afraid of.
I hope that in your case, with the buyer breaching ToS with asking for off-platform contact and threatening you and all, CS would reset your order completion and delivered on time stats, but you never know. I’d keep an eye on any notifications and deadlines that you might need to react to (for example, if he declines the cancellation, send a new request right away) and ignore any weird messages.
Hopefully, support will react soon, I don’t see any further actions that you could take from your side, for now, so try to relax and stay calm. Don’t do him the favour of feeling terrible, in any case. It’s a mere annoyance that will pass soon.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 3:20 am",2020-08-05 23:02:35.971324

To be honest in your place I would’ve contact CS anyway. He is blackmailing you and most likely he is blackmailing other sellers.
If you will let it go right now he will think that it’s ok and will do it to other sellers.

Try to regularly online & marketing your gig on other social platform.Try to use trendy hashtag
Very bad advice. People don’t buy from someone because they used a trendy hashtag. Plus people won’t appreciate seeing a gig when they search it.
Hashtags only work if they a relevant and you’re sharing insights, not hustling.

You may have had an extremely rare experience where you remarkably hired the same person, with two different accounts (especially if it was in the same service category). While this is completely against the rules for any user (i.e., having more than one account), it is far more likely from new users who usually ignor the rules, and have no seller reputation. Not all of us brand developers are like this.
I find it highly unlikely as well, that two different sellers (if they were two different sellers) would provide the same exact work. That just doesn’t happen – on the level you described.
Please don’t let the bad experiences drive you away. There are many great sellers here on Fiverr. With better pre-order research, and maybe even a more experienced seller (with better social proof), you are likely to avoid this happening again. Be wise not to hire the cheapest sellers as well. Sellers that undersell themselves – at rock-bottom levels – often blend in more with the troublesome buyers you don’t want to hire.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 5:29 pm",2020-08-05 23:05:19.925964

Regular",5,"Fiverr does not guarantee your gig any sort of specific placement. There is no need to contact CS about this.
From the Seller Help Center:
“A Gig’s position in the marketplace is based on seller performance over a set period of time. Gig positions are not permanent and can rotate on a daily basis. There are many factors to take into consideration, some of which may include order cancellations, delivery rate, responsiveness, etc. There may be other Gigs currently performing at a higher rate than yours. If other sellers are ranked higher, they may be consistently getting 5 stars, delivering on time, communicating quicker, etc. This all counts. Make sure you deliver high quality, original work, avoid late deliveries and cancellations, be responsive and always keep a professional manner.”",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 2:00 pm",2020-08-05 23:05:25.117253

What, exactly do you want CS to say? The official statement, from the Seller Help Center, that @vibronx already quoted, IS the same answer CS would tell you. You are not going to get the answer you seek, if that answer doesn’t match how Fiverr works. Fiverr is what it is. If you want to obtain more orders and success, than this might be a good time to take responsibility for that success, and do what you need to do in order to reach out to your target customers, and convince them to hire you.

*Eligibility of leads and members for Fiverr Studios is determined periodically by Fiverr. There is no application process. You will be notified if you are handpicked for Fiverr Studios.
So we don’t know the requirements, but a lot of them seem to be level 2 or TRS so I think it would increase your chance of being picked if you got to one of those levels. Quite a lot of reviews might help too.

It is not necessary to contact someone via email to have your song remastered. It might be more convenient for you, but it is against ToS unless the seller has gotten permission from CS to conduct business that way (which is probably unlikely).

If you need time to gather more information, why not set a longer order delivery time on your gig? It always baffles me why so many sellers think they have to offer their services in only 24 hours.

You can already see when a buyer is responding in the messaging system. It’s already a live system. A different live system seems extraneous. Buyers have lives and time restrictions as well. The current system allows for back and forth communication – as time allows. Like I said, if your service requires more of a back and forth level of communication, give your services more time for communication. There is no need to rush services and communication just to get everything done in under 24 hours. As an example, my standard delivery is seven days, and that seems to work just fine for my process, and for the clients who hire me.
Set your gigs to allow time to manage them effectively. There is no need to rush. Buyers would rather have a seller take the time to produce full, complete, quality work, rather than do a rush job in order to beat a 1-day deadline.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 4:25 pm",2020-08-05 23:06:05.135204

There are about 15 posts a day from sellers (mostly new) who are saying they cannot find their gigs in search. I did a little experiment with my own gigs and found something out. You can search your gig and find it at the bottom then the next search can find it at the top. Gigs can disappear. One time I searched my gig and filtered it down to find it easier.

Regular",4,"I strongly suggest you delete your ‘video marketing’ gig as it is against Fiverr’s Community Standards to promise a certain number of followers and to offer fake engagement. It is also very dishonest.
From the Community Standards:
“In certain instances, sellers may be tempted to promise outcomes of their service which is not in their control. For example, guaranteeing to restore your Amazon account or promising an exact amount of viewers for a Youtube video by its digital promotion. Please refrain from promising outcomes that are not in your control because it misleads buyers.”
""Do not post, offer or ask for:
Followers, subscribers, fans or views on social media platforms.
Fake engagement on any platform.""
Read the Community Standard here:
https://www.fiverr.com/community/standards
Also, your buyer mentions a Zoom call in their review. Communication outside of Fiverr is a violation of ToS and can lead to a warning unless you have gotten permission from Customer Support.
From the Terms of Service:
“To protect our users’ privacy, user identities are kept anonymous. Requesting or providing Email addresses, ■■■■■/IM usernames, telephone numbers or any other personal contact details to communicate outside of Fiverr in order to circumvent or abuse the Fiverr messaging system or Fiverr platform is not permitted.”

Fiverr does not provide protection for users who interact outside of the Fiverr platform.
In your case it depends on what communication would need to be exchanged, on what purpose and why outside of Fiverr.
You may want to contact CS, explain your case and ask for approval. Should they approve it, you are good to go. This is the safest way.

Hi, is it safe to send an affiliate link of a hosting company to client in inbox.
Yes, and as long as you disclose to them that it’s an affiliate link I don’t see any reason for anyone to claim it’s unethical, rude or unprofessional.
The only thing I’d add is to have your client’s best interest in mind and offer them something they will benefit rather than just offer the one that pays a higher commission.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 12:55 pm",2020-08-05 23:07:18.154659

First of all let me thank you for reading this post and I hope you are staying safe in these crazy times that we find ourselves in.
Let us begin… I am a level 2 Seller here on Fiverr, and I have been here since 2016. Fiverr became my main and only source of income back in 2018, and it has been great towards me ever since. My main/ most popular gig is offering Music related services ( Writing lyrics and offering audio references ). When I created my gig there were only 16 other gigs in this category, I remember. Now there are 18 pages of gigs hehe.
Anyway, I was one of the most searched for, as many youtubers have ordered from me and I left them very satisfied, apart from youtubers and rappers, most of my clients were very satisfied with my delivery ( thus me gaining a 5.0 average ( no flex ) ).
So my gig used to have around 1K impressions a day, and around the 4th of July ( it fell DRASTICALLY!! Reaching 25-50 impressions a day and absolutely NO CLICKS OR ORDERS… )
I did not change a single letter in the description, I didn’t change anything in my account description… I didn’t do anything that would result in such a “shadow ban”.
I contacted fiverr, and I really hope that they can fix it for me :D, but in the mean time, did anybody else have such an experience and if so, how did you resolve it?
Thank you all, hope you have a great day and stay safe",https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/c/a/e/caee7b2640fd2484db9ac367d005ce322f864990.png,N/A,N/A,parakdraw,0,"Have the same problem, just sudden drop on last page, and CS won’t help at this.

how long did it take for you to get your first order and what do you think let you accomplish that?",N/A,N/A,N/A,sandrineisen,4,"Hello and welcome on Fiverr,
Here is my experience on Fiverr: level 0 still, 53 days on the platform, 0 days with warnings, 19 orders completed, 1 order cancelled by the buyer (not enough information for me to work with) 1 order I just delivered and 3 active orders to be delivered soon and only 5* reviews.
What I have noticed so far is that it took me 15 days to get my very first voice over order. Then I waited a week more to get my second voice over project, and since day 30-35 I receive almost every day one order. The more time I am on the platform, the more orders I get. Indeed, the algorithm behind is rewarding “trustworthy” sellers meaning sellers that:
Deliver on-time orders
Get good reviews from buyers
Provide clear communication
Self-improve themselves by taking a course (or more) on Learn from Fiverr: gigs ranked better when the linked course is successfully completed
Answer quickly to message from new buyers and make sure to check buyer requests frequently.
Don’t violate Fiverr ToS: please make sure you read it entirely it’s very important.
Concerning your question on what you can improve on your gig:
I suggest you add your picture on your gig description: it helps buyers to have somehow the feeling to deal with a real human
Can you offer more extra on your gig? I don’t have a logo design gig so I don’t know if you can add more like: extra fast delivery, for instance. This way, you’ll get more options for the buyer to choose from and also more money
Good for FAQ part, why choose me bullet points
Are you sure about this? “The First 5 orders are only 5 dollars for any of the packages!” I don’t think it’s a good idea for you because it appears it’s not possible regarding your 3 packages gig: premium is at $30 and standard at $10. I am a bit confused here, and I believe buyers may also be, which is not good for your business.
I hope it helped you.
Regards",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 12:51 pm",2020-08-05 23:07:53.379281

Can you share some tips or help me optimize my gig?
I will brilliantly edit your videos (GIG) 2",N/A,1,"Aug 2, 2020 11:34 am",shmdtalha,1,"Hi there!
First of all, make several gigs for different services. For example, one gig for explainer videos. Another for cinematic videos. A third for editing and improving clips. And so on, based upon your expertise.
Once the niche is chosen, select the most relevant keywords. Right now you’re targetting both vlogs and cinematic videos in one gig. Now, since you’re targetting one field per gig, select keywords ONLY that are relevant. Go check around 15-20 competitors of yours and list down all their keywords and rate them according to their relevancy to your specific gigs.
Once you’ve done this, rate them according to whether they will be even searched or not. For example, I’ll give a small but very significant fact. You chose ‘video editing’. Yes, this keyword is VERY relevant to your gig, but will a person even search gigs using that phrase? No! He will write ‘video editor’ or ‘edit videos’ instead, in the search bar. I hope you get what I mean.
Next, see the competition in your niche. You have chosen keywords with 30,000+ competitors. Do you really think that when sellers have thousands of 5* reviews, will buyers go down the last page of the search results to buy yours? No, they will look for the gigs on the top page. So choose those keywords which have around 500-2500 competitors mainly, from the list that you have.
Congratulations! Now you have the top 5 keywords anyone can ever have in your field! What do we have to do with them? Make chatni for your samosas
Na, just kidding. Use those 5 keywords as your search tags. Try to add 2-3 of those search tags into your title. And repeat all your search tags in your description around 2-3 times EACH. Repetition is very important here. Remember one thing, don’t sacrifice the smooth flow of text while repeating them. Sprinkle them in naturally. Your descriptions need to be engaging and converting as well. You will lose your potential customers if you do that.
Well, this is it! The recipe towards a good rank in Fiverr search engines.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 11:28 am",2020-08-05 23:08:50.253551

Here are some few suggestions I would like to make:
Maybe try to reduce the line spaces in your gig description. I feel the spacing is too much and might cause your potential clients to lose interest.
Something I’ve realized is that no matter how great your gig is if nobody knows it’s out there, you would still have low sales. So here’s a tip: Try to send out the maximum 10 buyer requests every day. I understand that you might not get 10 requests you would love to apply for, but the keyword is try. Monitor times when buyer requests pop up and apply consistently.
Don’t expect to get replies or sales from every buyer request. You could be lucky, but don’t expect it. You could get just one sale from 50 buyer requests or 1 sale from 10. It’s fine. It’s one sale more than you previously had. Edit your buyer request proposal till you find what works. Google ideas on this too. Also be polite and confident when you are sent a message or an inquiry by a potential buyer. (Ensure that all your replies and actions are within Fiverr’s TOS)
Search for high ranking gigs related to your service and get ideas from them. Please don’t copy and paste. However, it would help to see what others in your field are doing.
I know it can be discouraging when sales are not coming in, but stay resilient and determined. Take a break if you need to as well.
I really hope you find this helpful and that you make huge sales soon!",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 8:56 am",2020-08-05 23:09:42.081725

I recall that this is certainly not the first time you have asked the same question over the past few weeks, but it does not seem like you listen to what we tell you. If you have sent 300 proposals to Buyer Requests and gotten no response, then perhaps you need to change your approach. You need to tailor every response to the individual buyer, not just copy-paste a template proposal.
This is a good place to start if you want tips on how to write Buyer Requests, but I am sure someone has already shared it with you:

How do you deal with buyer’s indirect or direct blackmail over review for more work or unnecessary revise?,"Your Fiverr Experience

and then I got his first indirect blackmailing message over the review for a demand.
I tried to hold him off by making an excuse and get over the current gig,
Moreover, then he increased his demand further as the delivery date approached,
By anyhow I managed to hold him off, and delivered my gig as promised, as proposed before his order and during his order.
But,
Even after holding him off for doing such things, he again comes down to blackmailing me on changing review to negative if I will not agree to his demand, I am just keeping him off to do anything that’s pointless.

by the way, could you help me share me how to get the rate of conversion up ? my conversion is going down this time although the views, clicking is going well. Thank you!
If your conversion rate is going down whilst your views and clicks are going up, your gigs aren’t doing the job of converting people into buyers (or at least message-senders).
I had a quick look at your gig - I don’t speak Vietnamese, but your singing voice sounds nice. However, the quality of the recording isn’t that good. Could you perhaps invest in (or even borrow) some slightly better recording equipment, to help you produce a more polished audio demo? (although keep in mind the quality of your work would need to match the quality of your demo!)
Also, you don’t really use your description as much as you could/should. Your description is an opportunity to talk about you, about what you offer, about why a buyer should choose you, and you’ve only included a line or two. Maybe have a think about how you could improve this?",N/A,"Aug 18, 2019 4:47 am",2020-08-05 23:10:57.928594

The competition who make sales and who have social proof of client satisfaction have not only top-level equipment, but a top-level recording environment. So why would someone hire someone who doesn’t have this?

It’s because of your marks are below 7, I thought that can be the issue but NO, it not.
You can see attached images below for your confirmation:
Here you can see my Score:
I’ve even passed both of these ENGLISH Test But still, it’s showing and that RETAKE button doesn’t work (it’s greyed out):
If someone from Fiverr is seeing it, PLEASE resolve this. Some users even reported this issue with the same problem that I’m facing.
Many Fiverr sellers are now creating gig with irrelevant categories and that’s why 50% of sellers aren’t getting orders and it’s also making a BAD impression on buyers. I’ll say it again PLEASE Take notice on this.

I was reviewing my pay out method and looking forward to know what you guys prefer.
I always used to use PayPal but thinking to shift to Bank Transfer now.
Here’s a rough calculation that made me think about trying Bank Transfer. Let me know if I am short of knowledge about this.
Let’s take $1000 payout as example:
1) PayPal option:
Fiverr to PayPal ($1000 - $1 = $999) transferred to PayPal = $999
Less: PayPal receiving charges: 4.4% Flat + $0.30 = ($44.26)
Not deducted on Fiverr withdrawal
Net amount received in PayPal = $999
PayPal to Bank ($999 @ 61.84/-) = INR 61778.16
2) Bank Transfer Option:
Fiverr to Payoneer ($1000 - $3 = $1000) transfered to Payoneer = $1000
* Less: Payoneer withdraw charges: 2% on total amount = $19.94
Not applicable to Indian sellers
Net USD transfered = $1000 @ 62 (approx) = INR 62,000.00
Net benefit = INR 200 (approx)
So, only difference is of $1 and small exchange rate difference

I was reviewing my pay out method and looking forward to know what you guys prefer.
I always used to use PayPal but thinking to shift to Bank Transfer now.
Here’s a rough calculation that made me think about trying Bank Transfer. Let me know if I am short of knowledge about this.
Let’s take $1000 payout as example:
1) PayPal option:
Fiverr to PayPal ($1000 - $1 = $999) transferred to PayPal = $999

I was reviewing my pay out method and looking forward to know what you guys prefer.
I always used to use PayPal but thinking to shift to Bank Transfer now.
Here’s a rough calculation that made me think about trying Bank Transfer. Let me know if I am short of knowledge about this.
Let’s take $1000 payout as example:
1) PayPal option:
Fiverr to PayPal ($1000 - $1 = $999) transferred to PayPal = $999
Less: PayPal receiving charges: 4.4% Flat + $0.30 = ($44.26)
Not deducted on Fiverr withdrawal
Net amount received in PayPal = $999
PayPal to Bank ($999 @ 61.84/-) = INR 61778.16
2) Bank Transfer Option:
Fiverr to Payoneer ($1000 - $3 = $1000) transfered to Payoneer = $1000
* Less: Payoneer withdraw charges: 2% on total amount = $19.94
Not applicable to Indian sellers
Net USD transfered = $1000 @ 62 (approx) = INR 62,000.00
Net benefit = INR 200 (approx)
So, only difference is of $1 and small exchange rate difference

Fiverr to PayPal ($1000 - $1 = $999) transferred to PayPal = $999
Less: PayPal receiving charges: 4.4% Flat + $0.30 = ($44.26)

Yes for higher amount Payoneer is best, be it $50 or $500 it’s $3. Yes, they took 2% conversion charge again USD. So, if $1= INR 75, you’ll get INR 73.5 which is better compared to PayPal I think.",N/A,"Apr 12, 2020 10:39 am",2020-08-05 23:12:21.214133

if we withdraw from Payoneer $1000 to INR we will be received 74,235INR ( conversion rate:75.9826INR against 1USD) this price include $3 charges & 2% conversion rate

I was reviewing my pay out method and looking forward to know what you guys prefer.
I always used to use PayPal but thinking to shift to Bank Transfer now.
Here’s a rough calculation that made me think about trying Bank Transfer. Let me know if I am short of knowledge about this.
Let’s take $1000 payout as example:
1) PayPal option:
Fiverr to PayPal ($1000 - $1 = $999) transferred to PayPal = $999
Less: PayPal receiving charges: 4.4% Flat + $0.30 = ($44.26)
Not deducted on Fiverr withdrawal
Net amount received in PayPal = $999
PayPal to Bank ($999 @ 61.84/-) = INR 61778.16
2) Bank Transfer Option:
Fiverr to Payoneer ($1000 - $3 = $1000) transfered to Payoneer = $1000
* Less: Payoneer withdraw charges: 2% on total amount = $19.94

You will most likely be able to see more requests once you become a Level 1 seller.

clients request revisions constantly when it’s not included
I just thought, maybe a good solution to this would he to add an option in the resolution centre for buyers who aren’t satisfied with their final delivery - for the cases where the seller is actually in the wrong, for example uploading an incomplete delivery, using copyrighted material etc. ?
Buyers with no revisions can still technically keep an order in limbo indefinitely despite agreeing to the terms of the order when they purchased it. Maybe this would be a step in the right direction?",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 2:48 am",2020-08-05 23:12:52.358306

Hi, My name is Marina from Europe (Croatia). I have 14 years of professional experience, and I just recently joined Fiverr as a provider of graphic design services. I want to cooperate with you on this, but I would like to have a conversation before the actual offer and order to talk about details. The budget is negotiable and depends on what you need except just logo designing. All my designs are my own custom made, hand-drawn and computer-processed and I offer logo, overlays, animations, and video clips. But the price depends on the complexity of your vision. Please check not only mine but every seller’s portfolio (certificates) before making an order and make sure to contact whoever comes in last selection through the inbox to have more details on what you require. Kind regards, Marina

My stance is that buyers know they are ordering a three day service when they hand over their money to Fiverr.
Not only this but, as I mentioned, I always send a message thanking clients for their order and reiterating that they will receive it within 72 hours and that I will be in contact if there are any problems.
But I guess it is human nature that people want reassurance.
I do however think @humanissocial is right in this particular case - it’s a control thing. As I said, he’s never caused me any problems as such - but I think he is mean… always maxing out the word count, chasing, and not leaving feedback.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 6:54 pm",2020-08-05 23:13:27.879768

Maybe he’d relax a little if he knew he could order exactly 857 or 1012 words or something for the price relative to your 1000 words gig, so he’d not feel the need to watch his word count like a hawk and wouldn’t feel like underpaying or overpaying?
As for the chasing, you could try to not let him wind you up (I know, easier said than done but you know how they say it always takes two), just calmly assert your own control over your part of the deal, maybe save a quick response like “No worries, you’ll receive your file within the delivery time”; maybe he either needs an additional “ritual” to feel reassured and if it just takes one click more maybe it’s not too bothersome for you, or maybe he’ll realize that there is really no need to worry eventually.
“Why do some people feel the need to do this?!” vs “but I think he is mean” sounds a bit contradictory to me; if you see the possibility of him “needing” to do that, it probably means he isn’t mean but just has some issues.
That doesn’t make the situation itself much better for you, but I find it makes it easier to not get wound up if one acknowledges that some people have more issues than others (don’t we all have some) and to just accept it if it just means one additional message per order for the people who need it (if someone really disturbs your workflow, it might be worth a bit of thought, of course, or might not be worth the pain and time ultimately, we’re not being paid for being customers’ personal psychologists, after all, at least most of us aren’t).
As long as he keeps ordering and pays the correct price (with the 999 words balancing out the 1001 words in the grand scheme of things I admit I rather find this funny, actually) and needs one additional message to feel at peace, whatever. If he’s neither abusive nor a scammer, nor do you feel he isn’t rude but just a pain (maybe just decide to not let it be a pain, it might work), I wouldn’t call that mean, mean would be if he kept leaving 3* star reviews and coming back ;).
Listen to your gut feeling is often good advice, however, sometimes, it can also be good to face one’s demons ;), or to go beyond one’s comfort zone, sometimes it’s really best to part ways, sometimes it’s an opportunity to work on ourselves and might turn out just fine, you’ll find the way to deal with it that’s just right for you at this time.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 8:56 pm",2020-08-05 23:13:28.680184

I actually have a quick response ready for everyone who is asking about the time so I don’t stress out writing an answer and I just have to press the button.

Or I’m attaching a screenshot of the timer with the time left. (So basically reappearing your first message that you are sending out when the order is placed)
Maybe if you will send him the same message every time he asks he will stop asking it?
He is not the first time buyer that doesn’t know how fiverr works and just worried that they don’t know a seller and don’t know if the seller will deliver.

Maybe something like shown in the following thread could be used for buyers who want that:
Updating System
Tips for Sellers
So. I want to share and provide tips on how a seller can update his buyers on progress. I personally use a system I created and this is working out for me, (see attached screenshots). How the system works: I basically have 4 pngs. 1. Your order is next in queue, 2. Starting Order, 3. 50% done, 4. 100 % done, delivering soon. You post an update according to the progress. My customers like this system as I keep them informed :)) You can use my system , I’ll also attach the pngs. Hope this hel…
eg. show some sort of progress thing for those that want it. Even if you’ve not started work on it.
I always acknowledge new orders by saying something like “Thank you for your order, please leave it with me and I will deliver your completed project within 72 hours…
You could see if saying “3 days” instead of “72 hours” makes any difference to how often they contact you about it. Maybe there could be a multiple choice option added in the requirements for if and how often they would like progress updates.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 6:59 am",2020-08-05 23:13:31.043268

My standard delivery time is 4 days and I make sure I let people know that. But I think, the longer the delivery time is, the fewer people like this you tend to attract. My buyers usually know the work takes time and they don’t mind waiting.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 9:03 am",2020-08-05 23:13:31.836481

If the work is in ‘revision’ you can let it sit, but it would be better to redeliver what you’ve done and let them know that if they need changes, they need to submit them with the revision request.

Rumor has it, Fiverr tends to give new buyers a boost in the beginning. My guess is, if a gig doesn’t accumulate any sales during this time it will be moved further back.
Or it could just be the algorithm doing what it does.
his meant that if you get no sale after a while, your gig will move back to the next pages. Hope you have many sales soon!",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 11:12 pm",2020-08-05 23:14:39.751033

Sharon",N/A,N/A,N/A,blavaro,1,"I do not often respond to BR but found following procedure useful. It works for me but may not necessarily work for others. Eg. the budget limit may vary from Seller to Seller.
I remove every request with budget less than $50 as well as requests that do not show any budget at all.
I consider remaining requests only (usually 0-2) that I read a few times.
In case I am comfortable with request (means I would be able to deliver what Buyer actually wants just using description in Buyer Request), I respond.
Response is straight to the point and honest. (I Never use following: ""I am professional, I have 10 years of experience, I will deliver with unlimited revisions, your satisfaction is my goal, and bla bla etc.)
I observed high response rate from Buyers with this method.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 12:46 pm",2020-08-05 23:14:56.136290

And absolutely, threshold depends on more factors, eg what kind of services you provide, what country you live, self confidence, language level, customer service level etc.
I have recently got response from Buyer saying he got 40 offers from BR which I believe were about $5 or something but still asked me because I acted according to 3. and 4. My offer was 10% higher than his budget and remember I deleted everything below $50.
It was the confidence that I got and brought the Buyer back to me. The confidence gained by correct response. I told them exactly what they wanted to hear.
I consider myself as new Buyer too and this will stay for couple of months or even years.

What some buyers actually want in their order request is sometimes different from what they tell you in chat. The reason definitely is because the client has a low budget fixed on the request.
Sellers are humans too don’t make them feel like a trash. Be open minded, let’s respect the service we share together.
A good customer service is achieved by trust.
Buyers should be detailed in their Order requests to avoid misunderstanding of any sort.

I am a buyer.
I have ordered three hours’ service from the seller ****** for 100 USD.
I requested him to complete 100 objective questions in accounting and asked him to get 50 out of 100. It is a three-hour one-attempt test.
However, during the test, he was too slow and incapable of completing most of the questions that I sent to him. I had to finish some parts by myself. In the next 24 hours, the results came back. It was 29.5% and I also showed the screenshot of test results as proof. Remember I completed at least 10 questions by myself (with the exact questions can be found on the internet.) So basically he was only capable of getting 16.5-19.5 in a test with 100 questions.
I was trying to negotiate with him. You know what, he told me at least 60USD sounds reasonable for him. And he blamed me for requesting him to send me the answers in Microsoft word, which I requested on the order page, 20 hours earlier than the exam. He could have discussed it with me or cancelled the order if putting answers in Microsoft word would actually have an impact on his work quality. He also blamed me for requesting him to clarify the answers that he already gave which wasted his time to finish other questions. But the answers that he sent to me were messy and I had difficulty figuring out putting the answers he sent to the answer sheets in accordance.
These are clear excuses for his incompetency!!!
Before I placed the order, I showed him the sample test so that he could have an idea on what types of questions that he would actually encounter and he could have an evaluation on whether he would be capable of doing the test. He should have known he did not have the capabilities to finish it but he took it anywhere.
I requested a refund. He declined and declined and declined!!!
I understand he did spend 3 hours. However, does it sound fair for buyers to pay the sellers just because he invested time and efforts, regardless of the work quality?
We could have found a more qualified seller if he hadn’t made such false promises.

However, during the test, he was too slow and incapable of completing most of the questions that I sent to him. I had to finish some parts by myself. In the next 24 hours, the results came back. It was 29.5% and I also showed the screenshot of test results as proof. Remember I completed at least 10 questions by myself (with the exact questions can be found on the internet.) So basically he was only capable of getting 16.5-19.5 in a test with 100 questions.
I was trying to negotiate with him. You know what, he told me at least 60USD sounds reasonable for him. And he blamed me for requesting him to send me the answers in Microsoft word, which I requested on the order page, 20 hours earlier than the exam. He could have discussed it with me or cancelled the order if putting answers in Microsoft word would actually have an impact on his work quality. He also blamed me for requesting him to clarify the answers that he already gave which wasted his time to finish other questions. But the answers that he sent to me were messy and I had difficulty figuring out putting the answers he sent to the answer sheets in accordance.
These are clear excuses for his incompetency!!!
Before I placed the order, I showed him the sample test so that he could have an idea on what types of questions that he would actually encounter and he could have an evaluation on whether he would be capable of doing the test. He should have known he did not have the capabilities to finish it but he took it anywhere.
I requested a refund. He declined and declined and declined!!!
I understand he did spend 3 hours. However, does it sound fair for buyers to pay the sellers just because he invested time and efforts, regardless of the work quality?
We could have found a more qualified seller if he hadn’t made such false promises.

Third-party TOS violation - By taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) you are actively taking part in a violation of the integrity code of most, if not all, schools and academic institutions. This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities.
There are sellers on Fiverr who will do academic work in spite of TOS.

He also blamed me for requesting him to clarify the answers that he already gave which wasted his time to finish other questions.

These are clear excuses for his incompetency!!!
Before I placed the order, I showed him the sample test so that he could have an idea on what types of questions that he would actually encounter and he could have an evaluation on whether he would be capable of doing the test. He should have known he did not have the capabilities to finish it but he took it anywhere.
I requested a refund. He declined and declined and declined!!!
I understand he did spend 3 hours. However, does it sound fair for buyers to pay the sellers just because he invested time and efforts, regardless of the work quality?
We could have found a more qualified seller if he hadn’t made such false promises.

None can understand what is the actual issue.
Probably you know fiverr’s terms of services. You may read it again.
Find out issue: Read your recent all conversation with buyers ( from previous day of receiving warning).
Focus on :
Have you discussed or provided or took email address, phone number, any social media, sk*pe or another communication platforms with buyers ?
Have you communicated with buyers outside fiverr ?
Do you discuss about payment or attempt to receive payment outside fiverr?

Optimise your gigs. Use key words in descriptions and use correct tags.
Your gigs are convoluted. Be concise and to the point.
Your gigs are 50% highlighted, only use highlights to highlight important information. For example, at the beginning of my gigs I highlight that customers must contact me first before ordering. I don’t highlight every second sentence.
Give your gigs a more personal touch. Customers land on your gig first, then your profile. At the start of your gig description, sell yourself first and who YOU are.
Distinguish yourself. Remember, there are hundreds of gigs on Fiverr offering exactly the same as you. What sets you apart?
Remove ‘unlimited’ revisions. Apart from that not being feasible, there are people who will take advantage of that to the point you want to tear your hair out.
Build a base of 5* reviews first, by either lowering your prices temporarily + offering more in each gig. I did this at the start, got a flood of orders and built a foundation to work off. I then increased my prices and I’ve maintained consistent customers.
Remove this “Give me a chance to prove my skill, you will be amazed by my service.”. You sound desperate here.
“I Don’t sell service only . I distribute Success , Ease And Status .” What does this even mean? How do you distribute these 3 things?
Your gig video audio is horrible. Either improve this, or remove it.
Take some of the Fiverr tests – including the English Language, Adobe Illustrator and Customer Service.",N/A,"Aug 1, 2020 11:14 am",2020-08-05 23:17:27.957405

Hi community members,
1.Some buyers share the documents for the project which were unable to open nor a spam file. Once we ask them about it ,they won’t respond any more
2.In the buyer request send by the client mostly data entry work, the amount is higher and were asked to contact them directly rather than through Fiverr.
3.Revision threat, some buyers use this tool as to steal our time even though we had finished it in a perfect manner.
4.Replay issue (Even though we are keen to towards the response timing we are not getting no replay from the clients end.)

You can’t just ‘take out’ a warrant. They don’t work like that. He would have to report a crime, and his local Police would have to agree that a SERIOUS crime has been committed, which is clearly not the case here.
It sounds like you’ve done nothing wrong. Block this guy’s emails - you can do that in Gmail, block all emails from a specific sender, or even a domain. Keep all communication in a folder somewhere, just in case. Then just ignore him and move on with your life. This guy is full of hot air.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 5:44 am",2020-08-05 23:17:41.108675

That being said this buyer provided the artwork for the cover, they dictated the whole entire design, down to the color and font placement, I am extremely easy to work with so I just followed directions. This buyer also had 2 versions of his cover done in two languages, I did the English version, he signed off on it multiple times, says “oh it’s great, it’s good, I love it”. Before we started on the other language version I made sure the English one was finished, he agreed and said it was done.
I finished the entire German version and then he gets back to me with, well I took out the cover on the street and it’s a failure people said it’s not good, so I want a complete refund. He also told me he went to law school (whatever that means) and that I would lose if I tried to fight him on a refund.
I mean I know how Fiverr works and I think it’s a good system, but it’s just so frustrating to be in this situation, and I super vet people I work with to try to weed people out who do this type of stuff or are flaky.
I’m curious what you guys do, do you just take the hit and cancel and lose about 3-4 hours worth of your time and months of revisions, or do you just refuse and let the order sit in your queue forever…?
He proposed giving me like 20% of the fee, which is ridiculous, I proposed I’ll take 70% he can have 30% back.
It’s just very frustrating, I do amazing work and I actually care and if the guy would have let me I could have made an AMAZING cover for him. I’m just not sure how I could have avoided this situation because at every moment he told me we were moving in the right direction with the cover and he loved it.

But suddenly I lost my gig ranking
Fiverr does not guarantee your gig any sort of specific placement.
From the Seller Help Center:
“A Gig’s position in the marketplace is based on seller performance over a set period of time. Gig positions are not permanent and can rotate on a daily basis . There are many factors to take into consideration, some of which may include order cancellations, delivery rate, responsiveness, etc. There may be other Gigs currently performing at a higher rate than yours. If other sellers are ranked higher, they may be consistently getting 5 stars, delivering on time, communicating quicker, etc. This all counts. Make sure you deliver high quality, original work, avoid late deliveries and cancellations, be responsive and always keep a professional manner.
Take Action! Click here 6 to check your Gig status.”",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 6:31 am",2020-08-05 23:18:01.837265

None of us have the power or authority to “get you more buyer requests”. Requests come in, when they come in, and you will only see the requests that you qualify for.

I also have this kind of issue.
What I have noticed so far is that for a personalized offer, when delivery is done the time delivery matches the one we refer in our regular gig.
For instance, if you have a gig for blog writing and say: “I will write 500 words for you in 3 days” but send a personalized order to a buyer mentioning you will write 500 words in 1 day when completed in 1 day you’ll have the message you saw: completed in 3 days.
