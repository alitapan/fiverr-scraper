Short answer is ‘no’.
Long-ish answer: if you’re willing to sacrifice your Fiverr account. In which case you must ask if it’s worth the risk.
Best answer I can provide: There’s nothing stopping you from making your own website anyway. There are several sellers for whom Fiverr is the supplemental, and not the main.
There are several threads on this topic, though the search function can be tricky. Let me see if I can find one or two.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 10:01 pm",2020-08-06 22:55:07.869680

That isn’t the point.
It’s insight. If you have a high rate of reviews that means the reviews give a pretty clear picture of what your buyers think of you in general. If you had a low percentage of reviews that would tell you the review averages don’t necessarily reflect the general opinion of your buyers.

Welcome to the Fiverr forums.
You only have 2 minutes of read-time shown in your forum profile. Check out the Tips For Sellers category (forum.fiverr.com/c/Fiverr-Tips/tips-for-sellers/l/top/all?order=views <-- with filters applied). You’ll find hundreds of threads offering advice on a variety of things to consider and/or improve. (Note: Not all advice can apply to all gigs or categories. Be sure you check multiple sources as there are some false tips, even among the top threads.)
It takes a lot of work to make it as a freelancer, so be sure to research and plan accordingly.

Far too many people on Fiverr think it’s okay to work cheaply and for long hours - particularly new sellers trying to establish their reputation.
While there are many genuine and excellent buyers who are willing to pay the market rate and above for skills, there are also just as many scam territory buyers who rely on sellers willing to sell their soul, grandmother and second child for $5.
You make a joke of earning £300 outside of Fiverr and $5 on Fiverr for the same time investment on your part. But it’s not a joke. Your buyer has ***** you, ***** you of your hard-earned skills, and denied you the opportunity to earn an honest living.
Far more seriously from my point of view, you’ve assisted in further devaluing the Fiverr platform for other genuine sellers who have invested their time and hope in the marketplace. You sold a gig for $5 when another seller might have been able to sell the same gig for $150 or $300. I say that based on your own comment.
At a time when many skilled people are struggling to be able to pay their bills and keep a roof over their head because of job losses, it is not acceptable to undervalue skills by such a massive margin.

I have to say, I agree with @garybaitson that this did come across quite harsh (which, based on all of your previous posts, I’m sure wasn’t your intention). In a free economy, people are entitled to price themselves at whatever amount that they wish, and for whatever reason they wish. Certainly, on a platform like Fiverr, I would expect to find fundamentally the same service (albeit at different levels of quality) at all different levels of the pricing spectrum, from dirt-cheap to ‘HOW MUCH?!’ expensive.
I get that seeing people offer huge amounts of work for relative peanuts can be frustrating, and feel as though it’s ‘bringing down’ the platform. But suggesting that a $150 sale was somehow lost because this seller offered to work for $5 doesn’t really make sense, as a buyer with $5 in their pocket isn’t going to suddenly stump up an extra $145 just because you take away the $5 sellers. There is a market for high cost/high value sellers to do really well here, and to co-exist with the sellers offering a lot for cheap. I guess it’s like the wine section in a supermarket in that respect - you don’t suddenly assume that the supermarket selling a £150 bottle of Dom Perignon is rubbish, just because they also sell Blue Nun for £2.99.
Not to mention, offering a lot for cheap is a very legitimate tactic for building a successful profile. We did it, back in the day. 10,000 word voice overs for $50? Yup, we did that, sinking 8 to 10 hours into the project for a £ return that would barely buy us dinner. But, had we not have done that back then, we wouldn’t be able to charge what we charge today.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 5:25 pm",2020-08-06 22:57:06.220223

The bottom line is that don’t over labour your yourself for a job you know you deserve more… if the client can’t afford it don’t get involved. Always know your worth and the limit you can go as a professional and this will speak for you in your freelance career.

I’ve had so many potential clients saying ""Well other sellers are only charging [any amount less than what I offer, mostly hundreds less while my prices are still way below average market value] and if I was in a situation where I needed to get jobs, I would be underpaid for my work, or overwork myself and quite possibly feel bad because someone else doesn’t value my work the way I do. So in that sense, I do agree that competition that is undervaluing their own work is harming one’s own business. Of course, it’s up to the seller to decide what they charge but I think it’s healthy and for your own sanity’s sake and that of your competitors to at least research the average selling price of a specific service.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 6:10 pm",2020-08-06 22:57:06.962096

I’ve found out it will be very hard to reach the next Level if I keep selling $5 gigs.
Even If I try to upsell a customer it’s very hard they will pay more than $10…
What did you do to reach the next level faster? Should I add more gigs to my profile?

Guys, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again… Impressions are NOT a good way to determine the success of your gig. We all know by now that there is a Fiverr bug that has erased the impressions listed for your gigs (yes, Fiverr knows about it, and is working on it). Please be patient, and please stop complaining about it. Stop responding as if the sky is falling, or the world has come to an end. Impressions say very little about the success of your gig.

Happened to me just a few days ago and it turned out it was because it was being reviewed after I’d made a few changes.
Here’s how you can find out if that’s what’s going on:
Click on your profile picture in the top right-hand corner --> Help & Support --> Seller Help Center --> Contact Us. Under “What can we help you with?” choose “Gig”, then “My Gig doesn’t appear in search”. Select the gig you’re trying to locate and see what the message you get says.

The only way to guarantee backlinks for someone is if you’re doing a sketchy blackhat thing.
Getting organic backlinks is dependent on many factors, most of which have nothing to do with the SEO’s work, but instead related to content that websites actually want to link to.
Google rewards backlinks that are relevant and helpful and of interest. So getting anything that differs from that is not an effective strategy and downright unethical.
No one should be selling backlink placements or placing them manually.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 12:53 pm",2020-08-06 22:57:58.464462

You’ve misunderstood me. That’s what I’m saying.
stylus1274:
in this case, if I hire someone to build me a site just like Fiverr, that’s totally fair and legit. Fiverr can’t be mad.
Yes, Fiverr can be mad if you sellers and buyers break their ToS. Have you even read the ToS? You aren’t allowed to use Fiverr to sell on another platform. Why on earth would any company allow that?
Here it is. He’s saying he will only work with the seller on this if they take it off of Fiverr. He is using Fiveŕ to drive business to his own thing and giving the seller an ultimatum to do it. Not ok. You don’t set ultimatums on sellers, especially when it requires them to break ToS.
And if you read the ToS you can’t communicate with a Fiverr buyer outside of Fiverr and you can’t do business with them out of Fiverr.
If you disagree, fine, but those are the ToS you agree to when you register and if people don’t want to follow them they shouldn’t agree to them.
gourav1207:
when i said that i will deliver the 2nd video on fiverr he said he wants the second video on his own freelancing platform otherwise he will not work here.
And besides Fiverr’s ToS, it is not in a freelancers best interests to be required to sign up for a whole other marketplace and deliver there just so that the client can get their commission. That’s a favour to the client and no freelancer owes their client a favour. A project is a transaction. It makes no sense from a business standpoint to let a client do this to you.
Being a freelancer does not entail doing favours for clients, especially if that client won’t even hire you unless you agree to do them a favor. All you owe a client is the deliverable. Anyone who uses freelancer ultimatum favors to build their business is sketchy as hell and not someone to work with.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 12:31 pm",2020-08-06 22:58:21.428887

There is an “If” there and that so very obviously means that “if” you are not registered for GST, then Paypal understands that you need not register for GST and hence need not update a GST number.
In other words, as far as Paypal states, those registered with GST, please update your GST Regn Nr and those who do not register their GST Regn Nr, Paypal understands that those people or companies need not register for GST Regn Nr.

We have updated our UA to comply with local laws applicable to Indian companies including local taxation laws. We have been advised PayPal Services will attract a GST rate of 18% (applicable only to the Fees charged by Paypal and not the whole amount you receive or your purchase price). Please consult your tax advisors in terms of your eligibility for refunds.
So the GST requirement is for Paypal to charge 18% from users.

Rs300
You can calculate this cost by checking exchange rate.
Lets say
$1 is 133 right now so Payoneer will give you $1 in 130 which means when you withdraw $100 it will take %3.5",N/A,"Oct 23, 2018 7:39 am",2020-08-06 22:59:22.993378

Don’t read any further unless your sole goal is to improve and you do not take offense at things like this:
A - You English in the titles is bad. “I will best work on excel and microsoft word” is not a proper sentence.
B - Even if it was, it doesn’t explain what you are offering. You work with Excel and Word. That’s nice, but it doesn’t summarize the work. Should be something concrete like “I will perform Data Entry in Word or Excel”.
C - Package description is also unclear. Provide information. “5 pages of data entry on word”. Give exact amounts so people will know what they’re buying. Also, try to remain professional “I will never break your heart” is something to put on Tinder, not Fiverr.
D - Did you check the market? Look at what other people in your field are doing. What their prices are, what their project descriptions are, what their images are.
E - “4 hours of work” is not a promising product. I want to know what you can do in 4 hours. If you can create what I need you to, I don’t care if it took you 4 hours or 30 seconds. I am paying for the final product. Try to monetize yourself based on final product, not time spent. I know it’s hard at first. But that’s what being a freelancer (usually) is. At least on Fiverr. Some sites sell “developer hours” but not Fiverr. Fiverr is selling products.
F - Your Image seems kinda generic. Pay attention to your looks.
G - The document in your screenshot looks plain. Also - The fact it’s a screenshot might give off the impression that you are being lazy. Create a beautiful document, with color coding, nice fonts, accurate alignment and so on. Then export that to a prettier file format (PDF maybe?) and print that. Make several of those.
Also, you have an “Activate Windows” watermark there. Very unprofessional in my opinion.
Apologies for being so hard on you,
Figured that’s the best way to help you.
Good luck.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 3:04 am",2020-08-06 22:59:30.532992

Introduction – This is not a list on how to make gigs. This is for gigs that are already made that are under-performing, need an overhaul, or just need somewhere to start for self-evaluation/education. It does contain a few general-information bits, and can help during gig creation, but that is neither the focus nor the intent.

Getting punished for having to cancel orders as a seller?,"Your Fiverr Experience

To clarify what I mean, all of my gigs revolve around word count - i.e. “I will proofread/write x number of words for $x”. Recently, I’ve had some buyers submit orders for 5,000 words. Whilst on paper that sounds great, after doing the work and talking to them, we’ve established that actually they only needed 1,500 words. But we can’t reduce the amount of words in their original order request through the resolution centre - instead, we have to cancel the order and then re-submit it with the adjusted word count. And it’s really getting on my nerves.
Why? Because as the seller, I get punished for it! There’s no other option than to cancel, which affects my Order Completion metric, and I worry that it signals to buyers than they should avoid me because I’m prolifically cancelling work without them knowing why. Sure, I can then complete the new order they send me, but that doesn’t really solve the problem.
For example, let’s say I’ve completed 18 out of 20 orders (90%) and I want to work really hard to increase my order completion rate. Someone orders too much, so I now have 21 orders. If we cancel and re-send it for me to complete, my new rate would be (I think - someone please correct me if I’m wrong) 18 out of 21 (86%), rather than 19 out of 21 (91%) if I could just complete the order (i.e. by reducing the scale of the order without cancelling).
If I’m wrong, and it actually would be 19 out of 21, then fine. But I still find it really irritating that we have to go through the unnecessarily long process of cancelling/re-ordering because we can’t reduce the size of the order! Right?

If it is a buyer error CS will cancel it on your behalf without it affecting your stats.

payoneer take a week to transfer.(sometime 10 days)
Payoneer suddenly block cards and to me, disabled my payoneeraccount.
So my suggestion is to go with paypal if you have issue with payoneer.
Paypal Fee - Maximum 1 USD for fiverr withdrawal
Conversation Rate Will be slightly less then payoneer
USD to INR 2.5% Fee in Conversation rate
Payoneer Fee - Nill for fiverr withdrawal
Conversation Rate Will be slightly higher then paypal
USD to INR 2% Fee in Conversation rate
Paypal No issues, Money Reaches bank account safe!
Payoneer Sometimes rise problem with verification and block accounts.
It is upto you, if payoneer works fine then definitely go for it.
If not working, then don’t waste your time. Make a paypal account.
Hope this helps.",N/A,"May 5, 2018 12:04 am",2020-08-06 23:00:16.592488

Yes that means you are paying for the right to use that voice in a broadcast such as TV or traditional radio.

It also depends on the Seller you select. My feeling is you are paying already to have my voice so the extra broadcast fee is there just so we are all clear on how you can use it. There are amazing voices on Fiverr who only charge $10-20 for rights. To me, I would pay you to hear my voice on television lol! All voice artists want the National Ad!

Ok but this must be corrected.

Report it to CS. We’re all just buyers and sellers on the forum.
CS has been taking up to 10 days to respond to users since the pandemic hit. Why clutter their inboxes with something that is not that serious?
I have dealt with this issue for 3 years and know that as long as my setting says I am on line I AM on line. Why waste their time. Besides if the green light appearing gray is still an issue then it is not going to be corrected anytime soon.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 10:41 am",2020-08-06 23:01:03.878806

Why can’t sellers who are not “seniors” answer your question? Do you not value their counsel and advice? And what, in your opinion, qualifies a seller to be “senior seller”?
Wouldn’t it be better just to ask for advice, and let anyone respond?
Are you expecting that “senior sellers” will miraculously make you successful, and tell you how to “get” lots of sales? Because, I hate to be the bearer of unfortunate news… YOU are the only person that makes you successful. YOU need to do the work to EARN your success.

Digital Drivers.",N/A,N/A,N/A,english_voice,2,"Even though @digitaldrivers appears to be an excellent seller (respect to you!) - the requirement for the next level requires all time earnings to be at least $20,000.
Plus the next level, which is Top Rated Seller (TRS), is a manual choice by Fiverr. It’s not an automatic promotion.
Those are two good reasons why the op is still at level 2!
His gigs are $5. So even having completed 1,100 orders - he’ll have only earned $5,500 before commission, which is only just over a quarter of the requirement for TRS status.
By charging only $5 per gig he is ensuring lots of orders. But, also by only charging $5, he is preventing himself from being promoted into the Fiverr big time.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 5:42 am",2020-08-06 23:01:36.902397

The weather is hot during the day (around 27-30 degrees), and cold at night (it can be even 7 degrees). Baltic Sea is cold in general, and water temperature is 18-22 degrees, but it’s totally fine for me. It’s like going to Spain in October.
However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

A live-action animated film is a film that combines live action filmmaking with animation. Films that are both live-action and computer-animated tend to have fictional characters or figures represented and characterized by cast members through motion capture and then animated and modeled by animators, while films that are live action and traditionally animated use hand-drawn, computer-generated imagery (CGI) or stop motion animation.

There isn’t anything complicated, it’s me talking to a cartoon character.",N/A,N/A,N/A,yogevsharabi,1,"I come from CGI, or 3D animation (modeling, texturing, rigging, lighting, rendering, etc), so I’m not sure if 2D animation is more difficult or less difficult to deal with. Sometimes something that you might think is easy and basic turns out to be quite a complicated process. Not always, but sometimes.
There is more than one type of animation, and that might require different solution. I believe the term for combining live action footage and animation footage is called “compositing”. I’m not sure about 2D animation (or cut-out/stop-motion, and some others), but with 3D animation, there is often a need for stuff like color-grading, so it’s more complicated than just taking the animation sequence and put it on a live-action background.
Compositing is on the VFX (visual effects) side of things, so it’s more editors than animators, or more specifically (correct me if I’m wrong), compositors.

Though the OP said “There isn’t anything complicated, it’s me talking to a cartoon character.” - to me that sounds like she doesn’t want anything ultra real or complex or even any colour grading (and I’m assuming no camera movement so no tracking). It sounds like it’s a simple 2D animated character (though she hasn’t said that).

I had experienced this lately, when one cliënt ordered a simple $10 gig, but didn’t want to deliver image files (a request I demand to keep up the quality and speed).
The cliënt requested me to download the files from his site, but without reference to the imagelink or section. I communicated that I don’t do that, because it’s stated in the information about the Gig. The cliënt was too lazy and requested a cancellation.
As a true hardcore Fiverr-fan I thought, let’s cancel, so we’re both mutually happy (client and designer) so we can continue our own path. After mutual cancelation, I noticed my deliveryratio went down by 20%. Where it was 100% for years.
I really felt surprised and offended, as I thought it would help in customerservice being friendly for a mistake a cliënt made. I know there are always choices, but I think it’s weird Fiverr is only looking from a cliëntside. In this way customers can on purpose downgrade professionals.
I think this topic is a long discussion, but worth for Fiverr to have a look at.
What do you think as a Fiverr-seller, experienced this before and how did you react?",N/A,N/A,N/A,english_voice,8,"This is an often discussed topic - with very good reason.
No matter why an order is cancelled, it is the seller who is penalised.
If the buyer orders a gig by mistake - the seller is penalised.
If the buyer doesn’t read the gig description correctly and wants to cancel - the seller is penalised.
If the seller has completed the work (maybe several day’s worth of work) and the buyer decides to cancel - the seller is penalised and loses their income.
Even if the seller and buyer agree a mutual cancellation, the seller is penalised.
For freelancers who choose to base their business solely around Fiverr, their reputations and ability to earn can be destroyed in a matter of seconds by one or two bad buyers.
The Fiverr assumption appears to be the seller is always at fault when it comes to cancellations. It’s always been this way, so it’s unlikely to change.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:01 pm",2020-08-06 23:05:24.107918

Regular",1,"Very urgent help is needed
The buyer had a requirement of MS word document template. Hotkeys were optional, but I confirmed that I will give her the hotkeys. But she never told me that she is using MacBook and also I have no idea that the document template made by me may not work on MacBook. So I had sent her the document template several times using different key combinations of the hotkeys. But every time she told me that it is not working on her MacBook. Then I told her to give me the specific key combinations so that I can make them as hotkeys, but she also never sends me that. I had told her to go to Mac’s keyboard shortcut option on the MacBook and just disable the specific key combination for which it might get conflict and not working. But she could not do this. I am confused that from such a long distance how I solve the issue. Now the buyer wanted to go for any other seller who is accustomed to working on a MacBook. Please help me out. What has to be done? I send the template several times, also I have tested it on several windows-based computers. It works well on all the computers, but I have no MacBook user at my surroundings. Then how can I resolve the issue whether it works properly on a MacBook or not?
I have got confused about why it is not working on a MacBook after giving her several hotkey combinations or she made any mistake to operate the macro-enabled document template.
After spending so much time, what will be good for me? Money is not so much important to me than the buyer’s satisfaction, but it is a prestige issue to get canceled any order? If the buyer will cancel the order how will I get affected as a seller? I have already taken the issue with Fiverr CS, but it will take time up to 10 days. But within a few hours, my delivery time will get expire. What can I do? Please guide me, I am very much confused. If there any negative happens, then how can I serve on this platform?
Indirectly related to the problem, but consider for future orders: make a requirement that asks ‘what operating system is this for’ and have the three main os options.
You’ve gotten a few suggestions, but when you told her how to “disable the specific key combination” was it all in writing? Could you include images with the step-by-step instructions? Make a video with screen capture to show exactly what to do?
We as sellers do have to sometimes do gymnastic for our clients, but it’s up to you if you want to cancel the order.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 9:54 am",2020-08-06 23:05:46.283154

Yes, cancellation does have consequences, but if you can’t help the buyer you can’t complete the order. If you had known the os was a MacBook before the order began, would you have taken it? You were working with incomplete information, so take this as the lesson it is.
The worst that can happen? Two possibilities, as I see it, based on your actions.
Keep working.
You fix the problem, buyer gives low rating, it is ‘forever’ on your profile, though you can respond to it. You keep the payment, but buyer might seek a refund anyway.

TOS states:
Third-party TOS violation - By taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) you are actively taking part in a violation of the integrity code of most, if not all, schools and academic institutions. This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activity.

True - but that’s the entire point of the forum. Those who wish to offer help can do so, and those who would rather not are under no obligation. What you’re suggesting, by messaging other sellers, can actually cause damage to the seller’s profile. If for example, that seller doesn’t notice your message in-time, and fails to reply to you within 24 hours, the seller’s response rate would be damaged.
Sellers are, in effect, forced to reply to you because of how Fiverr measure response rate and time. I can tell you as a seller who has had numerous people reach out to us like this in the past, we always politely but firmly direct them to the forum. And I’m afraid, on the very rare occasion where they’ve not taken the hint (ie; kept pestering for help), we’ve reported them as spam.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 9:56 am",2020-08-06 23:07:07.526265

Then how can I resolve the issue whether it works properly on a MacBook or not?
I have got confused about why it is not working on a MacBook after giving her several hotkey combinations or she made any mistake to operate the macro-enabled document template.
After spending so much time, what will be good for me? Money is not so much important to me than the buyer’s satisfaction, but it is a prestige issue to get canceled any order? If the buyer will cancel the order how will I get affected as a seller? I have already taken the issue with Fiverr CS, but it will take time up to 10 days. But within a few hours, my delivery time will get expire. What can I do? Please guide me, I am very much confused. If there any negative happens, then how can I serve on this platform?",N/A,1,"Aug 6, 2020 9:44 am",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-06 23:07:20.871583

This is unlikely to gain you any responses because the above is a statement all about you. Buyers are not here to give you 5-star ratings. Most of them could care less, they just want great work – even if they don’t plan on leaving any kind of review.
ahmedghumro:
With over 5 years of experience I am very proficient at designing beautiful “logo designs”.
This is extremely vague, and does not address the specific needs of a buyer. It you want to win the job, be personal. This is not personal or personalized.
ahmedghumro:

To be honest, your quoted seller response is one of the worst that I have ever seen. It is not personalized to the buyer, it is all about you and what you want to get out of the project, and it is vague and unimpressive. You can do better. All sellers responding with this kind of message can do better.
I’ve been a buyer in BR many times, and I can tell you with 100% honesty, I just ignor and delete every single copy-paste message like that that comes my way. The people I hire in BR take an interest in me and MY buyer needs, they don’t tell me how awesome they are, and what kind of review they want me to give them.
Perhaps that terrible copy-paste seller response is why you’ve sent 4,000 BR responses in two years, and won so few orders as a result
4000 Buyer Request Submitted & Only Get.......?
Your Fiverr Experience
Hello all, I submitted 4000 buyer request in 2 years but i only get 200 orders form buyer request option. And i know buy proposal for buyer request is professional and unique. check my attachment and please share with me your experience. [Capture111]
I also find it interesting how you were complaining about getting so few orders from BR, and when people started pointing out what you were doing wrong, you edited the number of orders received to make it look higher.
You have 518 reviews on your account. It is highly unlikely that you gained 200 of those orders from sending that terrible copy-paste seller response to buyers in BR.",N/A,"Apr 26, 2019 6:10 am",2020-08-06 23:07:41.929212

Why? Because you’re not tailoring to the buyer and instead making it all about you. Even in your message about success, you’re just saying what YOU want to get out of it. That isn’t how sales work.
It’s vital to tailor Buyer Request responses to the individual and their needs. Never just send a copy/paste message. You may think your message is convincing, but it isn’t. All it communicates is that you want work. It doesn’t communicate your value to the buyer and their needs.

In speed reading, you train your brain to process only start and end of the word and skip the middle, and by rest of the sentences conclude what are the words. As a result of that when I am typing normal speed (fast) my brain is processing words in the same manner so there are words today I can not type properly anymore like same I always always type it smea first, and then go back to correct it, and many others. And I do not see the mistake because of the way my brain is processing the words when reading.

Later when you do, you don’t just notice glaring spelling mistakes. You also see glaring problems with everything from your sentence structure to the basic readability of whole chapters.
I was fortunate to have a friend who is a professional editor by trade edit and proof my books. However, these days when I look at them, I feel like going back in time and slapping us both.

let a book rest for at least 6-months
Yes, that is exactly what I did. My first book was published in 2016, second one 2017.

I noticed a lot of “small” stupid silly grammar errors but I never had time to sit and properly go through the entire book, and now, quarantine gave me time I needed. I used Grammarly three times all over, then page by page with some Star Trek episode in between to relax, and this morning (since Monday quarantine is over and we go back to work) I send the files to publisher so from Monday they will print new versions and I will not touch them again at least one year, minimum.",N/A,"May 8, 2020 5:48 pm",2020-08-06 23:08:36.840145

A compound word is often a noun, something like sunflower or makeup and these usually aren’t hyphenated unless it is a noun phrase converted into a one-word noun. It is a noun whether the words are separate or apart in this case.
A compound verb is a verb. One of its uses is to change a noun phrase into a verb phrase.
So compound word - often or usually a noun, and a hyphenated phrase is a compound word if it’s a noun phrase into a one-word noun. Otherwise it is generally more specifically another compound type.
Compound verb - verb, typically changing a noun phrase into a verb phrase.
Compound adjective typically changes a noun or verb phrase type into an adjective phrase.
@misscrystal a hyphen joining two words usually is a single-word compound verb. It is usually used to change one phrase type into another.
For example, if I said “Guess what I threw over the counter?”, in that case “over the counter” is a verb phrase.
But if I were to say “I need to buy some over-the-counter drugs,” in that case “over-the-counter” is a compound adjective phrase.
It’s the same set of words, but the change in usage makes it a different type and thus demands you hyphenate (not dash).
Another example would be a noun phrase simply turned into a one-word noun and in that case you’d probably consider that a compound word.

It seems one of the problems is people want immediate fixes instead of waiting. When I contacted support it was almost a month before I got a response.

I’m not sure there currently is a ‘most popular’ design style. People have different tastes, and companies have brands. They’ll try to find something that fits their vision. If they don’t know what they want yet, that’s when you can try to promote your style or a style you can mimic.

There are 2 good reasons why I feel people change their gig titles after creating a gig:
They tend to create gigs for a specific growing market; maybe due to season or for targets that would bring enough sale at that point. Afterwards, they change the title to a more general form but similar or same service.
Some users hate sharing long gig url to friends. So they create their gigs with a very very brief title and later on, append some more texts to it.
I find the second quite useless but I don’t think those that change their gig titles, especially with the first reason in mind, had problems later on. I have seen those who found success with it.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 5:06 am",2020-08-06 23:09:51.462574

You only have 5 minutes of read-time shown in your forum profile. Check out the Tips For Sellers category (forum.fiverr.com/c/Fiverr-Tips/tips-for-sellers/l/top/all?order=views <-- with filters applied). You’ll find hundreds of threads offering advice on a variety of things to consider and/or improve. (Note: Not all advice can apply to all gigs or categories. Be sure you check multiple sources as there are some false tips, even among the top threads.)

For the translation gig I noticed that most of the other sellers have something similar to my image, meaning the flags of the countries and the languages involved. It’s pretty standard.
For advice gigs, again, most people use an image that represents the idea of love, help, friendship.

This will get you in hot water if the system flags the message OR if the buyer is annoyed that you are messaging them and your messages can be marked as spam which can get your account a warning or worse.
The buyers are already prompted upon delivery to rate the service they received, and I think they may even be reminded by Fiverr as well before the order closes out.
You should do NOTHING. Sit on your hands and do not bother the buyer to give you a review. Unless you want your freelancing career here to be short-lived.

I have never received a message on either Etsy or Ebay after I have bought something from the sellers to review my purchase - and would be annoyed if I did. I know how to review if I choose to do so.

“Fiverr’s Choice” seems to be random and useless,"Your Fiverr Experience

I’m not complaining about not getting picked out for the “Fiverr’s Choice” branding. I’m a successful seller, and I’m happy with where I’m at, even though orders have been slow this summer. They usually are, and the pandemic isn’t helping things. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s dive into why I think the Fiverr’s Choice is just a random branding that gets slammed on sellers for no reason at all.
I’ve been a successful voice-over seller on Fiverr for a few years now. In that time I’ve pulled in almost 500 five-star reviews, and I’ve completed just shy of 1000 orders. Yet, in all that time, delivering consistently high quality on all my orders, with only one negative review (because the buyer refused to pay for revisions as required) I’ve never, once, been awarded “Fiverr’s Choice”. Now that’s perfectly fine! I never expected to receive it, and I never much cared about such things.
Then, to my surprise, a new seller in my category, who delivers voice overs with a similar level of quality from what I can see, but has less than 20 reviews and less than a year on Fiverr, gets awarded the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge on his gig. Good for him. I keep getting orders anyway, so I’m not worried.
I do however think that something as visible as the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge should be awarded based on some sort of manual process. This is, after all, Fiverr saying “This is the service we, as the go-to platform for freelancing services online, recommends above all the others!”. That implies that some sort of manual process is involved.
One can only speculate as to which requirements Fiverr uses internally for this evaluation. When a seller with several years of great performance, no ToS warnings, almost 1000 delivered gigs and only positive reviews for years, is never once awarded this, but a new seller who delivers roughly the same quality with less than 20 reviews gets it, I become curious:
Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” just a random badge awarded for no reason at all?
I’ve seen several level 2 and top level sellers with 1k reviews or more who delivers some of the best quality I’ve ever found on Fiverr, with no such badge, so I decided to test two sellers in the same category.
One was a Level 1 Fiverr’s Choice seller with 34 positive reviews. The other, a level 2 seller with 1k + reviews - all of them positive.
Both were in the VO category, and both had the same exact pricing.
I’m not gonna publish the deliveries here, since I don’t want to cause anyone a bad reputation, but I will say that the quality from the level 2 seller was miles above the quality from the “Fiverr’s Choice” seller.
The friendly and useful information and support was also great from the level 2 with no “Fiverr’s Choice” badge, while the seller that Fiverr thought would offer the best service and quality consisted of the standard automatic replies.
From the order was made until it was delivered I received both a “Thank you” confirmation manually written from the Level 2, and a follow up when he started recording, two versions of the VO, and a well-written message to go along with it.
The Fiverr’s Choice seller however, delivered one single take, managed to gate the audio to hell and back (if you’re a VO you know what I’m talking about, if not, that’s basically cutting out all audio below a certain volume. Too much noice gate = not good!).

If I’m not satisfied with the final delivery, 5r should take responsibility. After all, if I’m buying based on their recommendation, they should have vetted them.
I’ve bought from TRS with less than quality work so I don’t put any stock into those badge. I go with gut instinct based on the quality of their gigs and writing skills.
I suppose some buyers wouldn’t know that. I think 5r is taking a big risk. What if their choices are mediocre to bad. All 1st time buyers will be turned off and think this platform is a joke. Unfortunately, 5r has low review and trust levels on many sites.
Each his own, I think it’s a random generator. I could be wrong, after all TRS is supposed to be vetted too.

If it was totally random the sellers who are here longer would get picked more often. It’s probably based on some info like has been suggested (eg. ratings (including the private feedback), on time deliveries, completion rate etc.). There may be some random element after that.

I’m not complaining about not getting picked out for the “Fiverr’s Choice” branding. I’m a successful seller, and I’m happy with where I’m at, even though orders have been slow this summer. They usually are, and the pandemic isn’t helping things. Now that we have that out of the way, let’s dive into why I think the Fiverr’s Choice is just a random branding that gets slammed on sellers for no reason at all.
I’ve been a successful voice-over seller on Fiverr for a few years now. In that time I’ve pulled in almost 500 five-star reviews, and I’ve completed just shy of 1000 orders. Yet, in all that time, delivering consistently high quality on all my orders, with only one negative review (because the buyer refused to pay for revisions as required) I’ve never, once, been awarded “Fiverr’s Choice”. Now that’s perfectly fine! I never expected to receive it, and I never much cared about such things.
Then, to my surprise, a new seller in my category, who delivers voice overs with a similar level of quality from what I can see, but has less than 20 reviews and less than a year on Fiverr, gets awarded the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge on his gig. Good for him. I keep getting orders anyway, so I’m not worried.
I do however think that something as visible as the “Fiverr’s Choice” badge should be awarded based on some sort of manual process. This is, after all, Fiverr saying “This is the service we, as the go-to platform for freelancing services online, recommends above all the others!”. That implies that some sort of manual process is involved.
One can only speculate as to which requirements Fiverr uses internally for this evaluation. When a seller with several years of great performance, no ToS warnings, almost 1000 delivered gigs and only positive reviews for years, is never once awarded this, but a new seller who delivers roughly the same quality with less than 20 reviews gets it, I become curious:
Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” just a random badge awarded for no reason at all?
I’ve seen several level 2 and top level sellers with 1k reviews or more who delivers some of the best quality I’ve ever found on Fiverr, with no such badge, so I decided to test two sellers in the same category.
One was a Level 1 Fiverr’s Choice seller with 34 positive reviews. The other, a level 2 seller with 1k + reviews - all of them positive.
Both were in the VO category, and both had the same exact pricing.
I’m not gonna publish the deliveries here, since I don’t want to cause anyone a bad reputation, but I will say that the quality from the level 2 seller was miles above the quality from the “Fiverr’s Choice” seller.
The friendly and useful information and support was also great from the level 2 with no “Fiverr’s Choice” badge, while the seller that Fiverr thought would offer the best service and quality consisted of the standard automatic replies.
From the order was made until it was delivered I received both a “Thank you” confirmation manually written from the Level 2, and a follow up when he started recording, two versions of the VO, and a well-written message to go along with it.
The Fiverr’s Choice seller however, delivered one single take, managed to gate the audio to hell and back (if you’re a VO you know what I’m talking about, if not, that’s basically cutting out all audio below a certain volume. Too much noice gate = not good!).
The message from the VO Fiverr had selected as their choice wrote “Here ya go! Pls give be good feedback.”.
What do you guys think? Is the “Fiverr’s Choice” a badge of quality, or a badge of being targeted randomly by the algorithm?",N/A,2,"Aug 4, 2020 6:46 pm",miiila,7,"I only noticed I had the badge on a gig when an order came in that had some banner telling me to perform outstandingly to get more Fiverr’s Choice orders or something, that wasn’t too long ago; ever since, I’ve had a few more Fiverr’s choice orders, they come and go. Recently, I apparently had the badge on my “second main gig” instead of my bestseller, as an order I got on that gig had the banner. It wasn’t as if I got swamped with orders or anything though, so probably not too much to worry about if one has it or not, or if others have it or not.
It might make it a bit more probable that people order directly without contacting you, so it can be a double-edged sword, depending if one likes direct orders without prior contact, or not.

I think Fiverr does do it to encourage sales of those gigs though. And most who have the Fiverr’s Choice badge don’t seem to be new sellers (as in level 0). The “Rising Talent” badge might be just for new seller.
You might be right, it might be manual, though I think if it is it’s not totally manual. They might select from a list of gigs that match certain conditions (like low cancellation rate, on time deliveries, good ratings for public and non-public) - or sorted by so that those gigs with the best stats are shown at the top of the list they select from.
Also I think the seller level might be a big part of it, whether it’s a manual selection or an automatic one. Around half the gigs with a “Fiverr’s Choice” badge seem to be from sellers with the TRS badge and very few have level 0/new seller.",N/A,"Aug 6, 2020 5:17 am",2020-08-06 23:10:44.171309

One gig title states: 'I will best work on of data entry as you want. This makes no sense.

This is an English language based website. Unless you can communicate effectively in English, then the majority of people are not going to order from you.

Tips for Sellers

You’re assuming you got an order here because you spent 12 hours a day here. That is faulty logic and makes no sense and I won’t let you encourage people to waste their time because of some absurd belief system you have about why you got an order.
And is it practical to stay online 12 hours to get a single order? No. You aren’t getting paid for that time. But I suppose advising people of that makes me impractical, right?

If it ends with a cancellation, you can try to appeal to support, but your chances probably would be higher if you sent the customer an extra to pay the additional fee, since their motto is “work it out with the buyer”. Not sure if they’d help with your OCR if you didn’t “give the customer the chance to pay the additional fee” first (from their perspective, it’s probably in dubio pro reo, the customer might not have noticed the option for 24-hour delivery, or that they could have contacted you to ask about same-day delivery, etc.). It’s improbable with how they acted but not impossible that they’d accept your extra, and the cancellation would be avoidable then.
It’s unfortunate that support takes so long to respond at the moment; as he didn’t order the 24-hour extra, you might have enough time to ask support to cancel vs cancelling yourself before the deadline, but if not, that’s an additional issue because it wouldn’t just affect your order completion rate but also your delivered on time rate then.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 9:40 am",2020-08-06 23:13:06.423227

If you cancel the order, the buyer cannot review you because they did not spend anything - their money is returned to their Fiverr balance. But, YOU pay a higher price with your statistics being dragged down. Not good.
If you are finding that you do not have time to complete a job, you need to extend the time of delivery on that Gig OR visit the Resolution Center on the purchased Gig asking for an extension on the delivery date so that you do not get penalized.

HI, I just read your message here again , yes , I only do dance videos on fiverr . And before I came here on fiverr , I was a Cartoon characters and cartoon logo designer , and I have about 8 years experience with cartoon designer , see some of my design from six years ago . But I didn’t plan to do any work as cartoon design , because my eyes gets problems to use computer for too long time, and too many seller already do this work on fiverr . So I spend time to research Fiverr site , then I think music video is a big market , then I plan to work with my other skills ----- "" dance "" , and I start to learn video edit by PR and AE , to use together with my dance , to make my dance video different from other dancers . I do spend a lot of time for the hard work too, I’m not easy to getting all of those actually , it spend me a lot of time too
Soem of my design from six years ago

The only thing I would try to make better would be the video lighting. You give a good detailed explanation in your video on what your gig is about, which makes me believe that what you offer will have plenty of information and help anyone out. This is a very specific niche that I personally can’t relate with, but if anybody is interested in horse racing, this would be my go to guy. I would like, however, if you added even more description under your video with key points, as in what specific things you will cover.",N/A,"Aug 20, 2015 11:31 am",2020-08-06 23:15:54.800824

I would probably write your website as a link on your profile, so I could see some examples of your work/posts. Also, I think that an eye-catching cover photo for your gigs could benefit as well. For example, the video games photo could be taken with natural lighting instead of indoor yellow lights, because it makes it easier to see. Also your other gig, with the purple writing, it’s a little hard to read at first glance unless I click on it.

The only thing I would change is add some periods and “consistent punctuation” in your translating gig. Some bullet points have periods, while others don’t. Also slight grammatical errors in english, but I’m guessing romanian is your primary language.
Example of your original: ""I have DALF C1 Certificate in French, so I can say that I’ve a lot of experience. I’m a native Romanian. I made a lot of translations, especially for the children.""
Example fixed : I have a DALF C1 Certificate in French, so I can say that I have a lot of experience. My native language is Romanian as well. I have made many translations, primarily working on childrens’ (texts, books, works, whatever the children’s thing is).
Overall though, really cute, only minor adjustments.",N/A,"Aug 21, 2015 10:46 am",2020-08-06 23:15:55.581682

My only suggestion with you is get Grammarly, it will help you with your English. Better English might help you get better clients and more orders. I don’t recommend raising prices at this point, but once your gig reaches 50 or 100 reviews, you could raise your prices by $5 or $10. I prefer going from $10 to $20 than from $10 to $15. I like even numbers more than odds, but that’s just me.
I have no other suggestions other than that. Good luck to you.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2019 12:48 am",2020-08-06 23:16:12.359818

Thanks for your reply.
Please don’t mistake my angry rant on the forum with my approach to customer support in the past week. I’ve been doing my best to remain professional and cooperative.
I wanted to help them sort this issue and was willing to provide any information they might have needed from me. I even understood the first couple of times they told me to “try and get along with the buyer”.
I know this post sounds extremely toxic and I guess they just broke me at this point. There’s a limit to how much crap a person can take and remain civil.
Regarding their decision, I know it wasn’t the best one they could have made, because if it was the case would have been assigned to a single representative who would have done the effort of going through the facts, communicating with both me and the buyer and promptly informed me regarding the reason of the decision that was made (which they still didn’t btw. I have no idea what their reason for cancelling this order is).
Instead, my case switch hands between 8 different people in a single week.
I worked in customer support in the past and I have many friends who still do. I have never encountered a company which allows cases to be handled like this.
I honestly feel like having a single representative responsible for taking care of a case which involves thousands of USD is not an unreasonable expectation. Do you?",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 2:14 am",2020-08-06 23:16:39.976497

I also do. I’m not saying your being unreasonable. I just suggested that CS MAY be dealing with a lot of things and maybe that’s why they are doing this. And I do agree that a thousand dollars is a lot and I think CS should really focus more on this because fiverr takes 20 percent and it can also be considered stealing.

What a joke…",N/A,1,"Aug 4, 2020 6:30 am",tatjanamitevska,3,"My opinion of a very busy new seller on this platform.
First month I had my rates lower than my usually rates to get reviews and I didn’t really filtered my clients, I didn’t even know how. I got 2 difficult clients and 2 order cancellation after delivery, the first one ask for revision which was bigger than the project itself and the second one was a horrible person that’s all. I cancelled the first one because I was new on the platform and I didn’t know better and the second one was cancelled by CS and was source of my anxiety and stress for 2 weeks ( I should have send a medical bill to Fiverr to pay for it). Total money loss from completed orders: 700$ in the first month.
So, now I have different strategy, beside from filtering clients but in your situation maybe it doesn’t help since maybe you have already approved this client.
What works for my is price increase, I have increased my prices by 107% to cover my loss and minimize my risk. I keep my project duration 1 up to 2 days to protect myself from working on a order for too long if it doesn’t end well.
Also, don’t put all of your eggs in one bracket, don’t rely on Fiverr as a only source of income. It can be tempting if you are busy with order but on long run you put your entire business in the hands of an algorithm and the CS.
Increasing prices will get you less orders but more time to focus on your business outside the platform.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 6:24 am",2020-08-06 23:16:44.306358

What a joke…",N/A,1,"Aug 4, 2020 6:30 am",gamingreborn,0,"Honestly,
I think Fiverr is enabling this kind of behavior for two main reasons.
The first being that they would rather piss off the working party rather than the paying party.
As a buyer, the amount of money you put in is pretty clear and therefore if something was done illegally, it is much easier to prove exactly how much you’ve lost.
As a seller, however, it is much more difficult to prove you are owed money you never possessed. Also, you would usually have put much more effort into the website and your gigs page, which would make it less likely that you would “turn on the platform”.
The second reason is purely saving money on the customer support side of things. I am pretty sure the formulaic responses as well as not actually reading what precious CS representatives have written, as well as the constant switch of cases between different CS reps means this department is just barely funded and they are overwhelmed with far more cases than they can realistically handle.
This of-course means it’s not really their fault, but the fault of management doing all they can to maximize profits at the cost of screwing us, the sellers.
The really baffling thing about all of this is that the fiverr TOS states the exact opposite of what they are actually doing, which makes me think they were probably forced to write them the way they did by some laws.
If I am correct, a legal action which would force them to comply with their own TOS is totally called for.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 5:01 am",2020-08-06 23:16:48.244391

That’s exactly what you should do, and it’s what I do for my accountant. Whenever I withdraw earnings, I issue an invoice to Fiverr (for the sake of accounts only, I don’t physically issue the invoice) to the amount of my commission for that withdrawal. I then immediately record a payment against the invoice, closing it off. You and your accountant then have an accurate record of all your earnings through Fiverr.

Tax IDs and countries are only relevant if you are selling directly to the person paying for them. But you aren’t. Fiverr is reselling your services on your behalf. You don’t issue invoices to individuals or report taxes on each person and their country because this is a marketplace where your services are resold on your behalf.
So none of what you wrote here applies:
karenjl:
And what data do you use to record the earnings? Because I am asked to fill in the following information:
Country, Tax ID, Name or entity, address, email.
What @cubittaudio is describing is just how he reports his income for income tax, NOT recording or collecting sales tax. You don’t account for sales tax because you aren’t charging the sales tax. Fiverr is. Sales tax does vary by country, so you need to follow the laws of your country, but just remember that Fiverr is reselling your services.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 1:30 pm",2020-08-06 23:17:03.748489

The very first sentence on my Fiverr listing says this exactly:
Contact me before placing order so we can talk about the photos you want :)!
This is important because I do product photography, and there are certain items that I can’t or won’t photograph. One of those “wont’s” is clothes. I explicitly said this at the bottom of my listing details and in my Q&A:
I accept most types of products, as long as they are under 1.5 ft^3 (0.45 meters wide, long, and high). I do not photograph clothes.
I had a customer today break both of the aforementioned rules, though; they placed an order for me to photograph 6 t-shirts, and without contacting me first. I am not mad at them or anything; it’s an honest mistake that I probably could’ve done, too.
But should I be penalized for the customer ordering something that I specifically stated that I cannot do? I went and filed a dispute aiming to cancel this order, and I understand that this will hurt my order completion rate. I don’t feel like it’s fair to the sellers, and I also feel like this system leaves a lot of room for abuse. Sellers can sabotage their competition by placing absurd orders that they could not possibly go through with, thus resulting in the penalty when they inevitably have to cancel. For example, asking a graphic designer to make a song for them; graphic designers can use this technique to sabotage their fellow graphic designers.
Is there someone at Fiverr I can get in touch with to have this cancellation not count towards my order completion rate? Also, curious if anyone else has had a similar sort of experience. Thanks guys and gals !

It seems that your gig description or title is not appealing enough to get clicks.
For example, have you checked how many gigs have MailChimp logo on their cover photo?
Do a search on “mailchimp”. Almost every 3rd gig has the MailChimp logo. How does this make your gig stand out? If you were a buyer would you click on this gig, especially when it has 0 reviews?",N/A,"Dec 22, 2018 2:38 pm",2020-08-06 23:17:57.227562

You don’t make invoices or bill clients. Fiverr does that on your behalf. This is a marketplace.
Just make sure you’re following the laws of your country. But no law changes the fact that Fiverr is reselling your services.
Never sign off that you agree to ToS until you understand them. You don’t.

This is true, but Fiver is reselling on your behalf so income tax is the issue here. So you need to deal with income tax but not necessarily sales tax because Fiverr charges that on your behalf. But the rules do vary by country, but this is resale via a marketplace, not direct sale to clients.
What I gather from accounting inquiries here is that accountants don’t understand that this is resale on our behalf.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 2:05 pm",2020-08-06 23:18:04.662012

Have a read of this thread, where this question was asked (and answered) earlier today. Should answer all your questions. I declare my Fiverr income here in the UK, and explain the method that I use in that thread. As @humanissocial has said, you need to ensure you’re following your own regional tax rules, but in terms of documenting your Fiverr income, you’re simply documenting the amount of commission you earn on the platform, not individual orders or by gig etc.
People over-complicate this when it’s actually pretty simple. And most accountants, especially the more old-school ones, really don’t ‘get’ Fiverr income.

How to send a proper buyer request?,Your Fiverr Experience,1,94,4,"Nov 23, 2018 11:46 pm",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 1:53 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/how-to-send-a-proper-buyer-request/292656,"devfoysal, page1ranker",page1ranker,4,"How to send a proper buyer request?
Last month I posted a request for a job in Fifa. I would like to raise the voice of the country, but the requests of some of the people who got the offer of sadness were very unprofessional - for which I had to select one of the other people on the condition of wanting.
Since then, many of us still have the basic idea of sending buyer requests. Still, they are continuously sending unprofessional buyer requests and the outcome is a negative connotation for our country’s freelancers to clients of outside countries.
So everyone who reads this post will read it properly, everyone can send the buyer request properly.
I try to show the rules that I accept as a cellar by sending a buyer request here.
In the case of sending a buyer’s request, keep in mind the following:
Choose the right offer: Only those requests are offered in a rugged way and the only thing you can do is send the offer to the request.
Take your time to read the description = There are many people send the offer without understanding everything completely! Thoroughly refrain from it.
What you do is, firstly pay attention to the buyer’s full recourse with time. Think carefully about what the buyer wants, then you can think that you can do that work 100% properly. Then you can click on “send offer”.
Keep your description clear, concise and to point = Your offer must be professionally written.
“Hello SIR / MADAM”
“Good morning / evening / other greetings”
“How are you?”
Avoid such unprofessional and irrelevant text.
Copy pasteed request to Everyone = Many of the newcomers, who have prepared a messy message, if you receive a request from your category, then copy and paste the same message.
Are you the people of that group? So avoid it today. It is never possible to get an order, because different clients will want different things, the same thing will be sent to everyone! Yes, you can send a few things in the same way, but if you think about sending the same prepared thing, you can expect the order to be removed.
You are sending a buyer request, not Eid greetings that will copy and paste the same thing with everyone.
Short and Sweet = Always try to write the offer as briefly as possible. Because more than you have got the buyout request, all the requests are very difficult to read, so the chances of avoiding additional big requests are more than likely.
Always keep in mind that the offer descriptiveness is not necessarily bigger.
Proper Pricing = Please do not send the offer of chicken to the person who has brought the cow corner budget, please! Remember, most clients want good quality, not less price.
If you think you have not been able to work at a higher price - so be prepared to get the job done for this situation, then quickly closing the Future tab and go to YouTube / Google and focus on increasing your skills. When the ability to work on the appropriate price, then return to Fever again.
Include the keyword = The keywords used by buyer must be properly used in the offer. You can understand that by looking at the buyer - you are well aware of what she wants, and you can understand all its recevrits properly.
Proofread offers = Before submitting the offer, take another look at everything like the exam paper, there is no error in it.
Be available = Buyer often likes the request, sending them text before ordering them. Make sure you can respond as soon as you have a buyer message. If you delay the message, then you will see the client cry out “Sorry I have hired someone else.”
Others = Sending a proper buyer request can not be learned suddenly in one day, after many experiments, you can easily understand how to send the appropriate offer. So follow the above rules, be patient, send regular requests.
Those Skills are sitting in many clays to give their jobs, try to be patient - get them.

This shouldn’t be a revelation or a secret - this is the absolute rock-bottom minimum requirement that should be instinctive to anyone in life, let alone a freelancer. There is an argument to say that anyone who needs to be told to read a job description before applying shouldn’t even consider a career as a freelancer. It hardly demonstrates the gut instinct, the talent and the determination it takes to succeed.
Also, on a personal level, I disagree that an individual should be falsely giving the impression that they are ‘a team’. Firstly, it sets up false expectations around quality control, response times, availability, etc. And secondly, I would argue that the majority of buyers prefer to deal with talented individual freelancers.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:40 am",2020-08-06 23:18:31.705029

None of this is true. Please don’t say things you can’t corroborate.
My saying it’s untrue that all Active sellers get a chance to be on the first page doesn’t mean I’m saying inactive sellers get to be on the first page. I’m not saying that at all and your interpretation of what I said is totally illogical.
That’s like saying if I say not all fresh oranges make it to grocery stories that that must mean I’m saying that spoiled oranges make it to grocery stores. See? It makes no sense to think I am saying that.
You’re saying all active sellers get to be on the first page. That’s just plain wrong and nothing you just argued proves it does.
There are hundred of thousands of active sellers, often 20,000 sellers per sub category. There are less than 40 spots on the first page. So how could everyone get a turn on the first page? It doesn’t even make sense.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 10:25 pm",2020-08-06 23:20:22.572296

A buyer who says they will “cancel the order to prevent you from getting a bad rating” is talking complete rubbish.
Firstly, they have already received your work. You should fight the cancellation.
Secondly, a cancellation will affect your stats. The Fiverr algorithm will no doubt now perceive you to be a less reliable seller.
Thirdly, you could interpret the buyer’s comment as a threat. In other words “accept the cancellation otherwise I will leave negative feedback”.
Fourthly, it’s not your problem that the buyer changed their mind. It is the buyer’s fault. Or, as a I suspect is the case, they simply wanted free work from the beginning.

“develope or fix” should be “develop or fix”

It says “unlimited revisions” but none of the packages have the number of revisions value set to “unlimited”

https://www.fiverr.com/shamazsaeed 6",N/A,1,"Aug 5, 2020 9:22 am",english_voice,1,"Hi. This might sound like a very small thing - but in your profile and gig descriptions as well as your gig titles, you haven’t left a character space after full stops / periods (.) or commas (,). This is a basic grammatical requirement of the English language. Because you’ve not done this, it makes your descriptions look careless to native English speakers, and it looks a mess on the page.
For example you’ve written:
I’m a developer with extreme heights of passion as well as i have rich experience of human computer interaction.I can bring your ideas to life and resolve your applications’ problems. I can help you with HTML5,CSS3,ReactJS,NodeJS,Firebase,Jamstack,UI testing.
I’m not going to correct your other grammar mistakes (there are a few mistakes in those few short sentences) but adding character spaces results in this:
I’m a developer with extreme heights of passion as well as i have rich experience of human computer interaction. I can bring your ideas to life and resolve your applications’ problems. I can help you with HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS, NodeJS, Firebase, Jamstack, UI testing.
Even though your gigs look appealing at first glance, when you look more closely there are actually many grammatical errors that will put off some buyers.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 12:19 pm",2020-08-06 23:20:48.680718

Please refrain from using those kind of words in the future",N/A,1,"Aug 5, 2020 4:19 am",saddam2016,3,Le me explain the whole story here now. Actually the buyer was my old client and he used to give work before each time when ever he gives work he pays so so so less as compared to the market value of that work. But I accepted and delivered. This time he gave work related to data entry I did not have much work at that time these were around 370 rows on excel sheet. He wanted me to update names of topics + finding relevant images for those topics which are free to use + he wanted me to add screenshots of proof that those images are for commercial use. That work was so tough that a normal data entry operator could not have done. Still I accepted and took my time to work the things out so that I can build a good relationship with that buyer later. I delivered it after 10 hours of constant working and guess what was he paying for it? 5$ lolzz. I made my mind to not accept more of excel sheet orders from him in the future. But after some time he offered me more work this time he offered 40$ and did not mention that these are 40$ for 8 worksheets. He sent a corrupted excel sheet. I tried my best to open it. The sheet did not open. I tried converting it online it still did not open. When I was left with no other option then i asked him to deliver it on google sheets. When I opened the sheet I saw that these were 333 rows and work is the same as it was done before. I thought he has realized that 5$ were so less for previous work that is why he will give me 40$ for this time. I accepted work. He said dont work on live spreadsheet copy paste work on MS excel. I was an idiot I did not realize he will scam me here. I even sent him the sheet before dlivering that work and he said its ok deliver work. When I delivered he said where are other 7 sheets? I said you sent me just one sheet. He sent that google sheet link again. When I opened it then I saw that there were 7 more tabs with rows around 300 to 400. I got shocked and started explaining him what happened here. He did not listen. I said increase money you have tricked me here. He said cancel order. I tried to negotiate but he refused to offer more money. I was already scammed alot before I made my mind to fight back. He opened dispute I declined. After some time CC cancelled my order and put my account under review and client had his money back.,N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 3:12 am",2020-08-06 23:21:27.809384

I called help from support they did nothing but copy and pasting message of we are sorry you had bad experience blaa bla bla. They were not done here. They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders. My first query took them 16 days to respond to me and do nothing. Second query about moving my gigs to last pages is still in process and is in queue now for 9 days. I suffered for nothing this marketplace is all full of ************* scammers now. I reported that buyer they still did nothing to stop her. She scammed me wasted my time and got away by receiving her full money. And I am being penalized and CC don’t care at all. They are customer care for their buyers not for sellers. So sad and the second big and very smart scammer is still need to be discussed yet.

saddam2016:
I had no option but to cancel it
That is youR first mistake. Fiverr CC can’t do anything after you agreed to mutually cancel the order. That’s it, nothing to investigate and all they can do is sorry you had a bad experience.
saddam2016:
They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders.
We all go through that. ALL OF US. All cancellations affect our “ranking” and position where gigs are shown. Fiverr algorithm decides where and how to show gigs based on the performance and fiverr CS can not fix that just because you want it.
saddam2016:
But I accepted and delivered
You didn’t have to agree for 5$ but you did.
saddam2016:
I thought he has realized that 5$ were so less for previous work that is why he will give me 40$ for this time
Why would she realise that if you agreed for that work and never discussed that with her?
**Guess what? If you multiply 8 by 5 =40$. **
8 sheets for 5$ is 40$ in total and that’s exactly what your buyer offered you. She took your previous price you agreed for and multiplied by the amount of work she had this time.
On the last point: your account restriction, you still didn’t tell us what exactly you were banned for. They sent you an email telling you what tule you violated.
Everything you are describing here is a normal freelancing process and we all go through working with difficult clients, it’s all about how you handle it and in this case it is unfortunately on you and solely you not being able to manage properly your clients.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:43 am",2020-08-06 23:21:34.223941

Of course it was “pre planned”. You did first project for 5$ so for the second order she sent you 8 sheets for 5$ each which is in total 40$. I’m pretty sure she wasn’t planning to scam you and only expected from you to do exactly the same as you did for her first order for the same price. That’s it.

If he would not have known then why he said its ok go deliver it.
Because it was ok to deliver that sheet And she didn’t have revisions for that sheet. And most likely she thought you will go one by one. She said ok to this file and after that as you mentioned she was expecting for you to start working on other files
Look there is no “scam”. And if there is then it’s actually you who tried to get 5$ one sheet for 40$.
Corrupted file most likely is just a coincidence.
And that’s not a scam if you agreed for 5$ price and your buyer asked you to do 8 sheets for 5$ (which is 40$) in total.
She asked you EXACTLY what you agreed for. And it’s not her problem to be honest that you suddenly decided that one sheet should cost 40$ without discussing or agreeing that with her.

Even on this forum they have their agents always ready to exploit the seller. and you humanisocial I have always seen you discouraging the sellers on other forums too and being so rude to defend fiverr by all means. This is not the first time. There are a couple of more faces who are also always ready to blame the seller. So I now understand that it is also a waste of time to discuss a matter here. Its better if I save time here and utilize this time finding jobs on other better platforms. I will just learn from some of my mistakes here and find better platform to build a portfolio. Thanks a lot for all of your suggestions. Fiverr is not the end of the world for me. With that attitude Fiverr will only make their good sellers run away.

Don’t say it like that! If your account ever returns I’ll suggest you continue working with it but smarter this time. You can’t quit just because of some negative experience you encountered! Learn from them instead.

When I delivered work she opened a direct dispute did not even call any revision. I repeatedly asked why she did that. She did not respond. I had no option but to cancel it. I called help from support they did nothing but copy and pasting message of we are sorry you had bad experience blaa bla bla. They were not done here. They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders. My first query took them 16 days to respond to me and do nothing. Second query about moving my gigs to last pages is still in process and is in queue now for 9 days. I suffered for nothing this marketplace is all full of ************* scammers now. I reported that buyer they still did nothing to stop her. She scammed me wasted my time and got away by receiving her full money. And I am being penalized and CC don’t care at all.

This isn’t a new trick. You didn’t have to cancel the order. It’s so sad that sellers here on Fiverr accept to work for peanuts and then actually believe that the buyer will treat them with respect. Don’t accept these kinds of orders for $5. This is what you are being penalized for, you’re also being punished for cancelling the order.

Now when they are also aware that it is not the seller fault then why they penalize my account and moved all of the gigs to the last page? What was my fault in it. I contacted them again and my ticket is again in queue now for 9 days.
Did you even read what I wrote to you before?
It looks like you just ignored everything.
But I’ll be kind enough to quote myself again on your first cancellation and your gigs moving to the last page. In both cases fiverr can’t do anything and we are all playing by the same rules. Algorithm is based on the performance and all cancellations are bad performance. And fiverr can’t do anything if YOU AGREED to cancel the order.

I had no option but to cancel it
That is youR first mistake. Fiverr CC can’t do anything after you agreed to mutually cancel the order. That’s it, nothing to investigate and all they can do is sorry you had a bad experience.
saddam2016:
They also moved all of my gigs to last pages and I stopped receiving orders.
We all go through that. ALL OF US. All cancellations affect our “ranking” and position where gigs are shown. Fiverr algorithm decides where and how to show gigs based on the performance and fiverr CS can not fix that just because you want it.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 7:22 am",2020-08-06 23:22:06.185237

You seem to have an issue understanding English. I wasn’t saying you broke a law. It was an analogy. You miscomprehend almost everything people have said to you here.
And no, Fiverr isn’t going to make buyers agree to things that weren’t in their contract. If you want to talk about breaking laws — that would be it.
You’re trying to make me see you understand contracts by arguing Fiverr should able to make buyers pay for things that didn’t fulfill their contract. Please note the irony.

I’m a new seller in Fiverr. Recently I faced a problem and I was so tensed about it. At the time of phone verification, Fiverr asked me to put my elementary school name, I put my full elementary school name, it takes almost 40 letters to complete my elementary school name, I successfully verified my phone number by putting this name. But when I tried to enable 2 step verification option, Fiverr asked me to fill my elementary school name again, but I failed, because it has shown letter limit, I just able to put 20 something letters only and it showed me incorrect elementary school name. What can I do now? I wasn’t able to put my full school name because of the letter limit. In the future, if I failed to verify me, maybe I get BAN from Fiverr. I’m so afraid about this my friend. Please suggest something. Thank you.

I’m a reasonably competent individual and I’ve been with Fiverr for seven years.
While it’s only ever been a part-time business for me, in all my time here (from hundreds of orders), I’ve only had one truly horrific experience (which CS resolved in my favour) and maybe half a dozen or so experiences that I would rather forget - ironically, one this week. So that’s an average of one bad experience a year. Not bad really.
If, as a seller, you offer a clear proposition that’s well written and backed up by good feedback, and you use your gut instinct to weed out the messages from potential buyers that you know will only lead to trouble (for me that means messages that are badly written) - then you stand a chance of running a near hassle free little business.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 4:10 am",2020-08-06 23:22:39.685525

Firstly, I can see that your gig description isn’t captivating enough. For reals, you will need a more detailed description. A more catching one at that, that would propel buyers, catch their attention and have them communicate with you.

This time he gave work related to data entry I did not have much work at that time there were around 370 rows on excel sheet. He wanted me to update names of topics + finding relevant images for those topics which are free to use + he wanted me to add screenshots of proof that those images are for commercial use. That work was so tough that a normal data entry operator could not have done. Still, I accepted and took my time to work the things out so that I can build a good relationship with that buyer later.

I was an idiot I did not realize he will scam me here. I even sent him the sheet before delivering that work and he said its ok deliver work. When I delivered he said where are other 7 sheets? I said you sent me just one sheet. He sent that google sheet link again. When I opened it then I saw that there were 7 more tabs with rows around 300 to 400.

I got shocked and started explaining to him what happened here. He did not listen. I said increase money you have tricked me here. He said cancel order. I tried to negotiate but he refused to offer more money. I was already scammed a lot before I made my mind to fight back. He opened dispute I declined. After some time CC cancelled my order and put my account under review and client had his money back.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-06 23:24:32.734764

I’ve had a customer once who ordered the same gig 3 x … she probably thought the order hadn’t gone through, and tried again. Fiverr refunded the 2 “surplus orders”, of course.
Another time, a regular buyer ordered, and because we’d been talking in the inbox and I noticed that she hadn’t accepted my offer, which was very unusual, I asked her, and she said she had accepted it but that indeed, just like for me, no order showed up. She contacted support, sometime later, the order was there. It doesn’t happen that often, but it does happen.

Be precise and clearly answer to the buyer’s queries if there are any in the BR
Ask questions if you have any regarding the BR.
Mention the timeframe and your quote.
Show your online portfolio if you have any.
Carefully proof read your offer.
Send offer to those BRs only where you are 100% sure that you can meet the requirements.
Don’ts:
Never ever use a template response for all BRs
Never use words like “Sir/Madam” etc
Don’t mention your years of experience. He/she can check it from your profile and portfolio.
Avoid over promising and grammatical mistakes.
Don’t write a very long offer.

We have all seen conversations get flagged if we say certain words (like pay, email or use an @) One of my clients had requested that I add a paypal link to the website I had just set up for him. Perfectly reasonable, right? I thought it was ok…so I proceeded to walk him through the process of generating the code from his paypal account that I would need to add the button he requested. Apparently I used the word “paypal” too many times and they flagged the whole thing. That’s what I got my first warning for–doing something that was within the rules but my account got flagged seemingly automatically based on words I used. On the other hand, I have had clients use the same words or phrases that I know get flagged. I have tried to conduct business as usual but I am afraid that my account could be flagged like that again for something my clients may discuss. Part of what I offer involves setting up social media accounts for people and then managing those accounts. Most social media requires 2 step authentication and the attachment of a phone number for verification. I usually try to get this information in my “gig requirements” but you are always going to have people who don’t put that information in there and you end up having to ask them “what email is associated with this account” or “I need a phone number so they can send your verification code” and that very well could end up getting flagged. Really wish they would work on that a little bit so that you don’t get flagged for doing legitimate work.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 12:23 am",2020-08-06 23:25:55.153062

You are probably a SEO Seller which no one buys from and with this topic you just want to “Remove” the competitive gigs. SEO Experts here just make some easy extra money practicing what they know exactly how to do it. If there are so many positive reviews on the seo gigs, why they are useles? Do you really believe that people throw their money just like that? Every SEO Expert who knows exactly what he is doing, will give you detailed report about his work and there you are able to see the change - How google indexes you higher and higher with your keyword. All things that you write here are completely bullshits and I hardly believe that anyone will trust them.

And there are a lot of sellers on Fiverr that own businesses or are very successful outside of Fiverr. Fiverr is a great community they want to be a part of where they can network and make extra pocket money. We even have a few famous personalities here and there on Fiverr so don’t assume that everyone on Fiverr is broke. Some people generously teach or sell their services for $5 which a lot of people can benefit from.

99.99% of fiverr seo gigs are black hat methods. But not only on fiverr, many online forums with seller marketplace are offering the same. All of those gigs with a promise of 100’s, 1000’s and even 10000’s links. Are totally spammy, not even 1 of them is worth ordering, unless you want your website to be penalize.



Many of my orders are seo related, it is hard to find a decent seo gig. Original content and a few links is usually a decent seo gig that worth ordering.



let them keep ordering and get nowhere, of course people will keep ordering those gigs as they want the easy way, and have zero knowledge in seo.

The smart ones, are the ones who do the right seo and those are the ones who will wins the ranking, and leave them with thinking why they’re not ranking.



@wr4th_ your gigs are not spam, they’re the definition of spam and black hat seo. Maybe you’re trying to protect your 0 worth seo service, but don’t send miss information to someone that ask a legit question. You can drip-feed and tire it as much as you want. It is still worth nothing.",N/A,"Mar 31, 2013 7:49 am",2020-08-06 23:26:16.138872

I was working on the gig one minute and then got a notification the next that the buyer wanted to cancel it. The buyer was unresponsive completely after that. I finally did accept the cancellation–like I said, this was early on in my fiverr endeavors–and noticed the drop in completion rate. It seemed rather drastic and inappropriate considering that I had a 100% on everything up to that point.

Getting that first job was a huge encouragement for me to take a look at which gigs were getting clicks and which ones needed some reworking or attention. My services offered include Wordpress setup and social media setup/management. I also added content writing to that and a custom job starting at $5. I found that this custom job seemed to be my best seller for a while but then I began offering the corresponding gig even if the client contacted me on the custom gig. The result is that my stats are up on the other gigs and now they are selling more and more. It seems that if you offer a broad service and something practical, an everyday service, you will get clicks. I ended up having to pace myself a little bit as of late though. I set a limit on some of my gigs so that it won’t let me accept more than 3 active ones at a time on certain ones. This helps me with time management and on time delivery.
On time deliveries also affect your stats that other users see. I have a 100% on all of my feedback and other items. This is evaluated every so often so if you do have a canceled order or late delivery for some reason or another, it will fall off after a few months.",N/A,"Aug 5, 2020 12:10 am",2020-08-06 23:26:55.075588

Till last month,I only had few orders, but in comparison he was level 2 seller with 100 plus projects completed just in 2 and half months.
Finally, I asked him of his secrets. I am going to share his secrets that landed me 25 plus projects in 1 month and i am now level 1 seller too with almost 500 plus dollar earning in a month.
The trick is to land on First page.
Initially, when you start working you won’t get any projects from people but as soon as you get reviews people start to prefer you. So instead of using multiple gigs , focus to have one gig with at least 7 plus reviews. After 7-10 reviews your gig gets displayed over first 3 pages. But mine got displayed on first page first line after 5 reviews and here is what me and my friend did.
We became Best seller.s Good buyers change the search options to best selling from relevance and that is where you get good buyers. To have a best selling GIG, it is all about communication. When you complete your project and buyer rates it. They also get an email after few days for another rating that sorts our gigs and leave feedback for fiverr. If you really had worked hard and made your customer happy (not just satisfied) that is where you get success. Try it ! Or you can search “matlab” and find the best selling gig with my name. Remember, I am assuming you have done all necessary modifications such as videos, self made pictures, nice descriptions, and proper tag etc.

I’ve been selling on Fiverr for seven years now. Anecdotally I can tell you that the number of sellers has gone through the roof in recent months. The competition is fierce and sadly the many new bad sellers drown out the good sellers.
You only need to spend 10 minutes browsing the forums to see posts like “new seller what do I do?” and “new seller no sales” and “new seller can I buy reviews?”.
Again anecdotally, long-term sellers who had built a good reputation prior to the boom in new sellers still appear to be doing well, but many new sellers are struggling.
There’s no point in giving up as you’ve done the hard bit already (creating your gigs) - but maybe just let your gigs be and hope that a buyer comes along.",N/A,"Jul 28, 2020 6:16 am",2020-08-06 23:28:15.599663

That’s one thing I try to avoid. I don’t think it’s a good idea to sell your experience for cheap. But as competition grows the price is falling. Who profits? Not the average seller I’d say.

I definitely see your point. My regular clients pay for my expertise and experience in the field, rather than my hours or the overheads, and for someone like me, I can afford to charge much less than my usual - especially on Fiverr, where others offering the same service charge anywhere between $5 and $30, and some even use stolen stock.
For me, I want to bulk up my client base, and get a backlog of excellent reviews on Fiverr. Once I’ve achieved that, my prices will go back to normal (with a small increase compared to my normal rates to cover fees). It’s an approach that I believe has worked. Would the customers I’ve had so far have paid my normal rates? Possible, but also it’s unlikely.
I do agree with the sentiment that prices fall as competition increases. Fiverr sellers in my industry consistently undercharge for their services (as mentioned above, some shadier sellers even use stolen images and unlicensed fonts!) which has made some customers believe that these lower rates are the norm.

Thanks for your comments…",N/A,1,"Jul 28, 2020 6:22 am",indigo_dc,3,"As a buyer, I find it very, very hard to find quality sellers. Although not in the market for audio - almost all of what I need is graphic design - I’m primarily looking for either quick concepts to flesh out my designs and get it ready to prototype, then later on I need professional work to truly bring the product to life.
What I find is an absolute glut of cheap, generally quite poor sellers where all their gigs look identical. I’ve tried a few and they have all been an utter waste of money. It’s now leading me to leave the platform because the tools available to me as a buyer mean I can’t find artists who are maybe more expensive than the basic $5 gig but below the $50 gig, and who are able to not only listen to the brief BUT add some inspiration into the mix.
If that sounds like I’m asking for “cheap top tier creativity”, I’m not really - I guess what I want to be able to find are sellers where I can say roughly what I want and at minimum, get that. But what I’d love are sellers where I say roughly what I want, get that but also something of the seller’s creativity & personality there that will really set things apart - and when I find that, you can be damn sure I’ll be paying for more of it.

I think there are sellers around who just use algorithmic logo generators and try to sell this as unique logo to you. (If you are looking for logos) I have seen some youtube advice about that.
But in the end: if you are just willing to buy for 5 bucks you won’t get quality work. (I’m not speaking of you, just general)
It also depends on where you live. If you are working from a country with low costs you have the advantage to charge less. But here in Germany a freelancer has to charge around 50€ per hour or more to be profitable…",N/A,"Jul 29, 2020 8:23 am",2020-08-06 23:28:29.047023

Think about this: how sustainable are your prices? As a freelancer you have to pay everything on your own. Don’t compare yourself with a contract worker. What about your health insurance? Do you wan’t to go to holidays? What if you get sick? You have to do so many things you won’t get paid for (taxes, accounting…)
You won’t get jobs from nine to five. So those few gigs you are doing have to cover everything.
Here is some advice I found:

I can never emphasise this enough. Try picking your niche, it has helped me A LOT. Let me show you what I mean. (Just an example) “I will edit any kind of video”, instead do “I will edit gaming videos”. This increases the chance of getting sales and let me explain why. With a generic term like the first one, competition is more fierce. Now with the second term, although people may search that term fewer then the generic one, the chances of getting a sale is higher due to having less competition.
I joined fiverr like three months ago. My first gig was not a success and I deleted it as I had better talents. When I got my second gig and third gig, they were a hit due my niche and not having a lot of competition (I only had like 2-3 sellers as competition and that helped me)
Summary: Pick your niche, optimise your gig accordingly and you may get more sales.",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 4:34 am",2020-08-06 23:28:31.411061

Well, that is not the case.
I started working as a seller, from Dec 18th, 2019, and I have been doing great.
completed 104 total orders to date. and earned a lot amount of money and reputation. Got level two seller badge and all.
and yeah I am from the same audio and music field. There are several things you might consider,
First of all, focus on your visual representation of your gigs. The more visually pleasing they are the more buyers will click on it.
2. Catch your buyers with words that are pleasing, try to question them in the description what are they looking for and provide the answer also. Convince your buyer that you are a big deal and they will have a great experience working with you.
It worked for me.
3. Takedown your gig price, some of them are utterly expensive and no buyer will buy something so expensive from a new seller. start at $5. gradually increase the price once you got hold of some good looking reviews and some badge.
4. Send buyer request daily. make a daily target to send 10 buyer requests daily and use the same tactic while writing to your buyers. First, let them know you will do what they want, then start asking questions like, what is the duration, Do you have a reference track, do you have an artist in mind, Will you record your vocals and send them to me, etc etc. and in the end write, Let’s have a chat and discuss this further. Believe me, it will work. If you can get one buyer to get into your inbox daily, you will have the chance.
and last but not least. Keep trying. It will work one day and you will be happy that you didn’t left.
Good Luck.",N/A,"Jul 30, 2020 12:52 pm",2020-08-06 23:28:33.765105

I’m struggling with this strategy. Not sure if it’s the right thing to do
I started on five and once i got level one badge i increased my price and on level two added some extra bucks to the gig. and also 5 is just a number, Once you have buyer in hand you can provide proper quotation of your service. Also always try to make 3 gig packages, I mean, $5 less quantity of tracks etc, $15 more tracks plus something more, and then finaly $30 $40 $50 dollar package, unlimited tracks, stem files, project file etc etc.
and dont forget to add extras to the gig options. Like commercial usage fees, Full exclusive rights fees etc etc. This is always give you some extra money.

I think that is called deceptive pricing (or bait-and-switch pricing or misleading advertising).
Sorry, but i think you got the wrong idea.
what i meant is to offer custom order to the buyer. I buyer will come seeing $5 tag and will contact you but most of the time buyer doesnt read what are you providing in $5. Like one of my gig states $5 for a 30sec track which includes 4 instruments and delivery will be mp3 file,
But what buyer is asking you to make is 1min track with more than 4 instruments and High Quality wav file with commercial usage, Will you give it to them in $5. Never.
So my point was, buyer always comes to $5 gigs but most of the time their requirments will require a custom order which most of the time buyers accept as it will still be cheap from high end pro sellers.
I hope you got my point.",N/A,"Jul 31, 2020 10:33 am",2020-08-06 23:28:38.159022

Please give me some advice on how to make a good score on the English exam because I want to give an exam.
You might already be good enough to pass the exam with a good score. Don’t forget, it tests for basic English skills, which obviously you have, as we’re both chatting in English.

Delivered Orders (after the Seller clicks Deliver Now and before the order is marked as complete)
The Seller requests additional payments, on or off the Fiverr platform, by withholding the final delivery of services directly related to the agreed requirements.

Well, it’s been few months since I joined fiverr. I have been basically working on designing stuff.
I received an order from a buyer and the buyer was so impressed, that the buyer kept on ordering my gig for 5-6 times. But I haven’t received order from any other buyer on that gig.
I want to know whether this “repeat buyer” thing really helps my gig or does it make it suspicious to fiverr algo that it might have removed my gig from front pages.

The rest is a little less. I don’t see any improvement now. In this situation, should I delete my gig and give a new gig or open a new account? Will my gig rank in the new gig?

Guys, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again… Impressions are NOT a good way to determine the success of your gig. We all know by now that there is a Fiverr bug that has erased the impressions listed for your gigs (yes, Fiverr knows about it, and is working on it). Please be patient, and please stop complaining about it. Stop responding as if the sky is falling, or the world has come to an end. Impressions say very little about the success of your gig. In fact, when it comes to success, …
Getting Through the Sales Slump - UPYOUR
Tips for Sellers
What can you do when your sales have suddenly plummeted? For many people the solution is simple - come on to the forum and complain about something else which “must” have caused this. It is probable that an outside force has caused you to not get as many sales. What is also probable is that you have no control over this “outside force”. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy a good rant or moan every now and then as much as the next guy but I never expect my moan or rant to actually change anything. When …

The last episode was in 2017. My favorite interview was the person in Fiverr responsible for SEO. His info was extremely helpful.
I realize how much work it probably is to create and maintain a podcast but it’s such a great podcast. I think sound options have improved since then but the topics are spot on! It doesn’t feel like an advertisement. It feels pretty authentic.

I have just launched my new gig related to Facebook ads designing. And, my gig is not performing well as I expected it to perform.
Basically I am a seller that provides content writing on Men’s fashion and style and I recently hired some people to work on ad designing.
So my questions are:-
Should I Operate both gigs with same profile? As content writing and designing are very different gigs in nature.
Any change I should make in my gig, as I am new in social media ad designing and don’t know much about setting up the gig.
Also, I am going to move on Level-1 this month so should I wait till then to see a spike in my gig analytics?
Answers to above questions and any other suggestion would be welcomed.
Thank you, everyone.
Stay safe.

Maybe there’s a bit too much text in bold in the gig description or it could be formatted in a better way.
Maybe “Are you looking for exciting, cool or unique Name for your Startup…” could be “Are you looking for an exciting, cool or unique Name for your Startup…” (without the bold).
I’m not sure it’s a good idea to include the numerology test in the gig. That’s probably more related to the “Astrology & Readings” section than the “Business Names & Slogans” section.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 5:56 am",2020-08-06 23:30:59.667375

Does the refund money get reverted to PayPal if they use that to pay?
Yes, and your order gets canceled, their account is automatically disabled. But they can create a new one.
debodutta420:
How does having fast delivery affect this situation?
Well, they targeted only fast deliveries. In my case, I offered fast delivery only for my $5 gig, so people can get it in a day instead of 2 days. However… these scammers purchased $20 worth of content even if the fast delivery is only for $5. So they forced me to do more work for a faster delivery. Since I had surgery and dealt with multiple cancellations, I was forced to basically do the work just to avoid yet another cancellation.
The next day after delivery, they came and asked for a cancellation, without showing any proof. They told me to either cancel the order or I will get a 1-star review because the content is copyrighted. When I told them I will go to customer support, they saw that I won’t refund, so they filed for a PayPal dispute and Fiverr accepts those automatically.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 9:03 am",2020-08-06 23:31:20.896445

Introduction – This is not a list on how to make gigs. This is for gigs that are already made that are under-performing, need an overhaul, or just need somewhere to start for self-evaluation/education. It does contain a few general-information bits, and can help during gig creation, but that is neither the focus nor the intent. For more information on any of the following sections or points, please see ‘Other Resources’ under (RRD) at the end of this post. Sections: (TCT) Title, Category, and…

Guys, I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again… Impressions are NOT a good way to determine the success of your gig.

I said this in different posts before, but from my personal experience, I usually get paid once a month, and the only time I got paid right away was something like baby/dog sitting. 2 weeks is extremely short compared to a whole month, so I don’t think there really isn’t much to complain.

True, we always do run into emergency situations where we suddenly need money.

Upgrading the system is a positive gesture like earlier when withdrawing revenues to bank accounts Fiverr did deduct $1 or $3 as per your choice but now it doesn’t. Earlier withdrawing to account takes one or two days now it takes a few minutes.
In the same way, we are expecting an upgrade in the clearance system also. When the rules are decided it never means that they will not be upgraded to improve user experience.",N/A,"Nov 20, 2019 11:09 am",2020-08-06 23:32:01.569900

That’s like having a regular job and getting paid twice a month. I have no problem with it. If you get orders on regular basis, you stop noticing the clearing period, as long as you don’t spend everything you’ve withdrawn at once.

Sometimes waiting 14 days for your revenues when you need them becomes frustrating.
That’s why I plan things in advance, and save up for emergencies.

Fiverr Ambassador",6,"When Fiverr was first launched, it was 14 days for everyone. It was 14 days to try and mitigate risk of chargebacks and other frauds.
PayPal would allow users to perform chargebacks up to 60 days. Fiverr knew 60 day withdrawals weren’t a viable option so offered 14 - under the assumption that any order issues after completion (which can take 3 days - so 17 days total), would likely rear their head within the 14-17 day period. If an issue did occur, Fiverr still has the funds to decide what to do.
As TRS were consistent sellers and frequently have orders and money going into their account, this risk is much lower (i.e. if a chargeback did happen, we will likely replenish our balance with other orders so Fiverr isn’t out of pocket etc). As a TRS you are also a proven seller and less likely to be fraudulent yourself.
If Fiverr had a one day clearing period it could easily be abused. Scammers could come on and place an order with a stolen credit card to any old account they owned on Fiverr - mark it as complete and withdraw the money. This obviously wouldn’t be good.
I personally think withdrawals should be based on a trust metric - such as time since last chargeback, completed orders, order cancellations etc and be reduced based on that - rather than seller level rating.
It’s also worth nothing that since Fiverr was launched, PayPal now allows chargebacks up to 180 days since purchase.",N/A,"Nov 22, 2019 9:59 am",2020-08-06 23:32:05.291335

As a former TRS, I felt it was a huge perk. I was making $50 to $100 a day, and getting my money in 7 days meant I could pay my bills sooner. Nowadays, I have to work a real job, Uber, etc. Now it takes forever to get my money. Lightning speed? I don’t think so. Lightning speed is getting my money in one minute, which I can do with Uber.

The structure is a reward system for top tier Sellers. An incentive for Sellers to climb the freelancing ladder. I’m not going to twiddle my thumbs and play with my hair worrying about something I have ZERO control over. My focus is on finishing up the semester with a bang.
I’m curious when you were a TRS, did you feel the same way? Did you want your money faster than (7) days?

Comparing Fiverr to Uber & Lyft is like comparing Barney the purple dinosaur to Ironman. The pay structure for those gig/ridesharing economy companies are convenient, yes.

Fiverr Ambassador",2,"I wouldn’t say futile, rather just outdated based on it’s original inception. I think there should still be a delay but base it on a trust metric.
For example, PayPal have recently launched “Funds Now”, which means (if you are approved), your account balance is always available - even during a chargeback. If you are not approved and your account has a dispute filed against it, it is often frozen/paused until the funds are added in. Fiverr could have a similar system in terms of trust. It would be great to see 14 days being the max but “trust tiers”, such as 10 days, 7, 5 & 3.

This is why people shouldn’t put all their eggs & rabbits into one basket.
fastcopywriter:
That’s a different issue. I have my eggs on many baskets, most of them pay me as soon as I request the money. Only Fiverr and my brick and mortar job make me wait.
nikavoice:
The structure is a reward system for top tier Sellers. An incentive for Sellers to climb the freelancing ladder.
Uber has rewards for gold, platinum, etc. However, we all get paid either once a week or as soon as we solicit the money. That encourages people with financial emergencies to drive. Fiverr doesn’t offer such encouragement. By delaying gratification (getting paid), they delay interest on Fiverr.
nikavoice:
I’m curious when you were a TRS, did you feel the same way? Did you want your money faster than (7) days?
Sometimes I did, although getting paid in 7 days was fantastic, you can relax and the money clears very fast. 14 days feels like a lifetime.
I’m just glad I have credit cards, so if I have a financial emergency, I don’t need to get my Fiverr money right away, but what about others who lack credit cards? What do they do?
nikavoice:
Comparing Fiverr to Uber & Lyft is like comparing Barney the purple dinosaur to Ironman.
They’re all part of the gig economy.
twistedweb123:
For example, PayPal have recently launched “Funds Now”, which means (if you are approved), your account balance is always available
Right! Which is a fantastic feature even if it has a fee. I like your trust metric idea, why not reward level 2 sellers with funds now? That would be great. Heck, charge a fee! I know Fiverr loves fees, so think of the revenues Fiverr would earn in addition to the 20%, buyer fees, etc.",N/A,"Nov 22, 2019 9:47 pm",2020-08-06 23:32:07.532200

I guess this is the best way to describe it, but again, personally I never felt/thought
anything about the 2 weeks period thingy. I simply accepted it as one of Fiverr’s rules, whatever the reason was behind the time period. I guess I was too used to the “getting paid once a month” situation. Getting your money in one week is very nice, but for me the most important thing is I DO get paid, and I’m quite grateful to have a job that provides me with that money.
I get it though, sometimes you just want something as soon as possible. Just because I don’t think it’s a problem doesn’t mean everyone else is cool with it.
I never thought the 2 week period was a problem and I never questioned it, but back then it did take a bit for me to get over the “Fiverr takes 20% away, even the tips” system.
Thankfully I’m over it now.",N/A,"Nov 23, 2019 2:15 am",2020-08-06 23:32:07.922964

think twice about complaining for a period of 14 days only!
If you think asking for an update for a better experience is complaining then we are doing so.
Earlier Fiverr do deduct $1 when you transfer your revenues from Fiverr to Payoneer in 3 days & $3 for 1 day transfer . But now they have updated the system & all the transactions from Fiverr to Payoneer are free & we receive them in minutes.
If Fiverr will be as like you that don’t think of an innovation or improvement in the system then they will be left with $1 & $3 deductions like earlier. They found that if we reduce the time & fee we can make the experience of revenues much better.
They are in competition with many freelancing websites from which I find Fiverr as the best. To keep themself in the game it is necessary for them to make updates & keep themself out of the box.
I understand many of you don’t have a problem with 14 days clearance maybe because you guys accept the things & just go with the flow.
I’m not saying I don’t accept this 14 days clearance but an update can make it better.

Fiverr is providing the same safety and security to Top Rater Sellers in 7 days which I appreciate to give them Royal exception because of a long long journey they have gone through.
By working on this clearance system I’m sure they will be able to make the revenues being cleared sooner by still keeping the Royal exception for Top Rated Sellers.",N/A,"Nov 23, 2019 4:17 am",2020-08-06 23:32:08.724370

My name is Awais & I’m catering here the services on Fiverr for more than one & a half years.
Through this long journey, I have found many improvements that can be made to make the platform more effective like adding a voice note feature to chat & many more.
The one I’m a bit frustrated with is 14 days clearance. This time frame can be reduced to 7 days like Top Rated Sellers & for Top Rated Sellers maybe reduce it to 3 days.
Sometimes waiting 14 days for your revenues when you need them becomes frustrating.
I think many of us should appeal Fiverr through Customer Support to work on this problem I know this is not easy as we think but a better way can be found.

Regular",1,"That’s a good question, and I’m sorry you hadn’t received any feedback on it before now. I’ll admit I don’t have anything in the ‘writing’ category, but this is something I’ve pondered. How much of it is the Fiverr marketplace? How does that reflect on actual demand? Which is the better market segment to pursue? Is Fiverr too mired in short and shallow services in the writing category?

One is for ghostwriting…with the intention of serving long-written books or novels,
You could split it into chapters or a certain number of chapters so it’s not a full novel or non-fiction book in one order. Maybe showing your different prices for different things (eg. type/genre of book, length of book) might help or creating packages for different lengths of book/different word counts.
I think in Fiverr stats & evaluations that shorter duration services are better, in that the stats would be less negatively affected by a cancellation etc. if you’re getting a lot of other orders rather than a low number of big orders.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 10:39 am",2020-08-06 23:32:17.572365

Unresponsive Buyers Damaging My Good Following,Your Fiverr Experience,4,84,5,"Jul 30, 2020 3:59 pm","Jul 30, 2020 4:11 pm","Aug 4, 2020 9:36 am",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/unresponsive-buyers-damaging-my-good-following/493933,"sarahtaylor1230, uk1000",sarahtaylor1230,1,"I have been on Fiverr for a few months, not quite a year. I have been mostly successful with it however, I have noticed lately that I seem to be getting a lot of buyers that are largely unresponsive. There’s been a noticeable uptick in this. I offer website and social media services so at times, I require the buyer to be a little more responsive–such as if I need access to a social media account and I need them to send me the security verification code that is provided to them by e-mail or text message since those are generally not something I have access to myself. If these buyers don’t provide this information, it is impossible for me to complete the work due to their non responsiveness. The clock ticks down and I end up getting a black mark against my account in the form of my 100% rating dropping for something that was not my fault.
Does Fiverr offer some sort of mechanism to pause the clock until the buyer provides the necessary information and that is confirmed by the seller? How do I prevent a job from going against my ratings if the time allotted is up and the buyer still hasn’t provided the necessary information to do the job?
Along those same lines, my required information usually will request things like website URLs, login credentials, among other things I generally need to get the job done. When this information is incorrect (and you wouldn’t believe how often that happens!) I also find myself not being able to do the job needed and usually not being able to get the buyer to provide the needed information. This leaves me with 2 choices–I can either deliver the job to prevent the clock from ticking down which charges the buyer for work not completed and run the risk of them leaving negative feedback OR I can dispute it and try to get them to provide the information necessary on a repeat basis. Cancelling a job automatically goes against the seller and hurts their ratings.

Also you could remove any “extra fast 1 day delivery” on any gigs where it happens a lot. Maybe increase the delivery number of days in the gig set-up for any gigs it happens on.

Ok fine…but he didn’t tell me what address he wanted it connected to and what he wanted to list the account under. Basically no information whatsoever. I then ran into the issue of each social media site’s various security verification processes–which usually just requires the client provide me with the verification code sent to their email. Once I get that, we are good to go. This client isn’t even understanding that or providing it. I am completely at a loss as to what else I can do that does not negatively effect me. My gigs are pretty specific though…and especially when I require login credentials and either don’t get them because the buyer put something different in that space OR they put incorrect information that doesn’t work in that space.—that’s an issue too.

No it isn’t at all.
And if all you’re doing is posting your gig link with a call to action and hashtags, you’re going to attract scammers because they know you’re desperate and that you don’t understand marketing.
Promotion doesn’t mean just posting your gig repeatedly.
Social media marketing can only help you sell if you’re sharing insights and understand how social converts into buyers. No one who promotes as you describe understands that. They just post their gig and tell people to buy it. That never makes someone successful.",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 7:10 am",2020-08-06 23:33:49.277648

No, the love making money – as any business does. But they do not guarantee that sellers will have their gigs featured where they want in the search results. The algorithm treats all gigs the same. Those that perform well usually rise to the top of the listings.

I mean, marketing. Promotion. Who are your target customers? Go to wherever they are located, show them how you can solve their needs, and then convince them to hire you.
I would guess that you’ve only been trying to make your gigs look good here on Fiverr, and that you haven’t done anything to market or promote anywhere else (wherever your target customers are located).

Fiverr has so many sellers that it is oversaturated in many areas. So to be fair, they move gig positions around. Even TRSs and Pro sellers have experienced loss in their placement as @frank_d has said above.

That is irrelevant. I can easily type anyone’s username into the Fiverr profile page url, and their profile shows up. Nothing shows up when I do this for you.

You do know that you don’t need to be a seller or buyer to have a forum account?
I see. So, you weren’t being truthful… and you really don’t have an account on Fiverr? If you’re not a seller on Fiverr, you aren’t someone who should be giving seller advice – especially since your “advice” is terrible advice, and should never be followed by sellers here on Fiverr.

It is against the rules of Fiverr to have more than one account – regardless of the reasons you have given. I’m pretty sure the same applies to the forum. In the past, the mods have removed forum access to user accounts that are not connected to an active Fiverr account.

(But never deliver nothing) The faster you deliver, the more the buyer will like it. But rushing a delivery might reduce your service quality, and the goal is to make the buyer love whatever they purchased. So always take your time to perfect whatever you are selling before delivering it, if possible.

You’re okay with defrauding people? You provide them targeted work (samples or otherwise), some of which they will likely use in their own businesses, and then you turn around and sell that same targeted work to someone else? What if someone chooses to take legal action against you because they see work you did for them, even if for free, on someone else’s website?

No.
This is Fiverr’s company and site. You don’t get to make your own terms of service.
Second, even if someone agreed to that and fully understood the ramifications of that, that doesn’t make it right.
When someone commissions you, they’re giving you their ideas and direction. So you’re taking their ideas and business direction and selling them, not just the product you made.
In any case, nothing you’re describing is an effective business model. No one becomes successful by doing half a commission without ensuring payment and no true professional would hire someone who values their work that way.",N/A,"Jul 16, 2020 5:40 am",2020-08-06 23:35:42.332545

he came back with another order (Let’s say O2) now. Considering the last issue, I didn’t charge him a high price.

They might be able to help better with this. Especially since he’s threatening you.
Yes he/anyone could probably could do legal action outside of Fiverr but like has been suggested it was probably just a threat And it was his fault for not checking/doing a test before the full print. And he accepted the terms that included “no warranties” etc…
Also if he’s threatening he should be reported I think (that’s against the TOS I think, as well as asking for payment outside Fiverr is also against the TOS).",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 4:02 am",2020-08-06 23:36:04.898045

I have an issue to be solved by the Fiverr. I had one order (let’s say O1)with the customer. In this order, I had delivered the file and he gave me 5 stars for the service. After some time he came back and told that product design defected (Mirrored wrongly) and he got that design printed already(he ordered print more than 20,000 pieces without checking the design on printing). I apologize, corrected the design, offered him a discount on the next design then.
he came back with another order (Let’s say O2) now. Considering the last issue, I didn’t charge him a high price. I made the minimal design with an already existing logo and it doesn’t match his expectation. He got angry and refused to proceed with this order.

He informed me that he is going to hire a lawyer for compensation of the O1 from me. I already have accepted the dispute for the second-order O2 and offered the free design for it but he is kind of thretening me by the legal warning.

Buyer already have a chance to see and ask revisions if there are any mistake.
Once they accept the delivery, then the project is final (unless you break TOS by stealling other works)
It’s just a thread…, your buyer won’t sue you …, does he want to waste more time and money again??? If he want to cancel the order, just let him cancel…, you won’t get high rating from him anymore so better to cancel this order.
and once the order is settled…, just block him.

I advice you exercise patience and improve more on your gig. Like @designs_4u1 suggested send buyer request regularly, check out similar services you can offer as well and create more gigs for them; the more services you offer the more exposure you get and you know what that means… I only realized this sooner but I’m currently improving on myself.
Your next sale may be today, tomorrow or never; nobody knows. Just follow the right steps and you’ll be nowhere far away from your first client.
Good luck",N/A,"Aug 4, 2020 3:43 am",2020-08-06 23:37:24.626925

After a day or so, the buyer contacted me asked for some revisions in inbox. I did what he was asking and thus he left with a “Thank You”.
Auto completed orders don’t have reviews, so I was really not happy with that experience. Lol

On Tuesday 29 July 2020 I have received three different email from Fiverr at the same time on my previous main account
The first email said there was an issue with my Fiverr account it was flagged. This is was my first warning.
The second email explained that my gig was removed.
The last email said my Fiverr account has been permanently disabled
As I said I have received them with a short notice not to mention it was a first warning. This is happened because someone who I had a disagreement with (NOT ON FIVERR) reported me for something I did not do,
In other words I was not given any chance to defend my case.
Apparently it was flagged for violations of Intellectual Property and third party’s Terms of Service.
This is wrong, because I have always respected and adhere completely to terms of service with Proof.
I’ve always had good review, I was using my own ressource.
On Monday 28 July 2020 I have left a review and commentary for this particular product which I bought in here
CodeCanyon 1
Grocery, Food, Pharmacy, Store Delivery Mobile App with Admin Panel 1
– Version: 1.5.0 – Last update: 14/06/2020 – File Included: Full Source code of Flutter App (Android & iOS) with PHP Admin Panel CONSIDERING PURCHASING OUR ITEM? Please v...
Price: $59 USD
My commentary included my Fiverr Profile to offer my service to fix bugs and adding new features for this product.
That’s how the author got my Fiverr Profile.
Following my review the author did three things :
1 )Reported my Envato codecanyon wich resulted on my account being locked
2)Reported me on my Fiverr account which resulted on my account being disabled for something I did not do !
3) They also sent me a threat email on my gmail account in my own language
Here is the translation of this email :
“Good bye retard there is only you left send me your location if you’re a man or I’m I wrong.”
Note : this person is from the same country as me.
You will find below the Screenshot as proof for what I just said, unfortunately I do not know the username Fiverr account of the person who reported me but here is the link of their Envato Profile Account if it help :

Thankfully I managed to retrieve my Envato account thanks to the support and now I’m currently trying to get a refund for their awful product who was not as described no support, no updates, a lot of bugs, security leak …
How do I get justice ?

Well, if you think you can prove to support that you didn’t do what you said you were reported for and didn’t do, and didn’t violate any of Fiverr’s nor any third party’s terms of service, you could try by writing them an email, not by creating new accounts after having been permanently banned and adding a(nother) terms violation thus. It’s pretty easy to find the contact email by googling, but it’s support @ fiverr.com
“Previous main account” is already a bad omen, as you’re not supposed to have a main and other accounts, just one account, full stop. Maybe best to delete this (and any potential other) side account/s/current main account/s before appealing to them about your previous main account.
Make sure you really didn’t violate any other party’s licensing terms or such first, in any case, to not waste your or other people’s time.
chikouzak:
not to mention it was a first warning
That doesn’t mean anything. I don’t know why people keep perpetuating, or even relying on, the completely wrong notion that one would only ever get banned after two or three warnings. Nobody is guaranteed any number of warnings before serious action is taken;
examples from the ToS:
“Rude, abusive, improper language, or violent messages will not be tolerated and may result in an account warning or the suspension/removal of your account.”
Nothing like “You may be rude two times and we’ll only ban you after the third time” there, you may or may not get a warning, or your account may or may not be suspended.
“Warnings do not limit account activity, but can lead to your account losing Seller statuses or becoming permanently disabled based on the severity of the violation.”
Again, nothing about a specific number of warnings, and the wording certainly suggests to me that, depending on the severity of the violation, you can be out on your first violation.
“Fiverr reserves the right to put any account on hold or permanently disable accounts due to breach of these Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards or due to any illegal or inappropriate use of the Site or services.”
Again, nothing about “after one/two/three/however many warnings” = they might disable accounts right away.
Fiverr reserves the right to act as they see fit. Sorry about stressing this point, but it’s my forum pet peeve; too many people, for whatever reason, think and make others think that they can violate the terms happily at least two if not three times before anything serious might happen, as this is not the case.
That said, I agree that users should be given a chance to defend themselves if someone accuses them of whatever, unless maybe it’s absolutely crystal clear that they did indeed violate the terms and Fiverr considers it a big enough violation to use the ban hammer (from reading the forum, and the internet at large, I guess it’s possible that they don’t have the time to spend on discussing the probably many clear violations). Good luck!",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 8:13 pm",2020-08-06 23:39:03.283087

On Tuesday 29 July 2020 I have received three different email from Fiverr at the same time on my previous main account
The first email said there was an issue with my Fiverr account it was flagged. This is was my first warning.
The second email explained that my gig was removed.
The last email said my Fiverr account has been permanently disabled
As I said I have received them with a short notice not to mention it was a first warning. This is happened because someone who I had a disagreement with (NOT ON FIVERR) reported me for something I did not do,
In other words I was not given any chance to defend my case.
Apparently it was flagged for violations of Intellectual Property and third party’s Terms of Service.
This is wrong, because I have always respected and adhere completely to terms of service with Proof.
I’ve always had good review, I was using my own ressource.
On Monday 28 July 2020 I have left a review and commentary for this particular product which I bought in here
CodeCanyon 1
Grocery, Food, Pharmacy, Store Delivery Mobile App with Admin Panel 1
– Version: 1.5.0 – Last update: 14/06/2020 – File Included: Full Source code of Flutter App (Android & iOS) with PHP Admin Panel CONSIDERING PURCHASING OUR ITEM? Please v...
Price: $59 USD
My commentary included my Fiverr Profile to offer my service to fix bugs and adding new features for this product.
That’s how the author got my Fiverr Profile.
Following my review the author did three things :
1 )Reported my Envato codecanyon wich resulted on my account being locked
2)Reported me on my Fiverr account which resulted on my account being disabled for something I did not do !
3) They also sent me a threat email on my gmail account in my own language
Here is the translation of this email :
“Good bye retard there is only you left send me your location if you’re a man or I’m I wrong.”
Note : this person is from the same country as me.
You will find below the Screenshot as proof for what I just said, unfortunately I do not know the username Fiverr account of the person who reported me but here is the link of their Envato Profile Account if it help :

Thankfully I managed to retrieve my Envato account thanks to the support and now I’m currently trying to get a refund for their awful product who was not as described no support, no updates, a lot of bugs, security leak …
How do I get justice ?

Do You Work With Buyers Who Don’t Read Your Gig Page?,"Your Fiverr Experience

This happened a couple weeks ago, but I keep thinking about it, and I thought I’d ask if others have done the same.
I provide copyediting and proofreading services. For my proofreading service, in the gig description, I don’t ask that anyone contacts me beforehand. Anyone can just order from that gig because it’ll likely be around 3k words and that’s nothing.
But for my copyediting gig, it is specifically for fiction novels. I usually get orders that are at least 70k words, and I like to be able to put as much focus on one, max two, at a time because of the varying levels of editing needs for the manuscript. In my gig description, it’s impossible to miss the part where I say the buyer needs to contact me and I need to see the manuscript (or at least some of it) to determine how heavy the copyedit will be. It’s highlighted and in bold.
One morning, I woke up to see that an order had been started on my fiction novel gig. I was already in the middle of editing a 160k-word novel and just starting another smaller one, so seeing that someone had not only gone through my gig and submitted their requirements but had also not even sent me a measly message—man, I was pissed. I had to cancel the order, citing the fact that I had requirements the buyer looked over or ignored. So, of course, it hurt my cancellation rate. I didn’t even bother trying to set up something to work with the buyer after that either, because I don’t want to work with someone who can’t even have enough respect to listen.
I just think it’s incredibly frustrating when buyers can’t even be bothered to read the gig page. I’ve now edited my Requirements section to include a message that states that we’ve already discussed the terms, and if they haven’t, they must cancel the order.
I just ask that buyers actually read the gig page. It’s not there as a backdrop. And it’s especially disappointing when it’s a fellow writer doing it. They should be most in-tune to details when it comes to reading.

Regular",5,"I am sorry to hear about your experience, and I agree that it sucks when buyers don’t bother to read the gig page. I don’t get why a buyer wouldn’t take the time to read it. It is like signing a contract without reading it first, but I guess people do that too.
I often have people order directly without contacting me. For my translation gig, I don’t require that buyers contact me first, so I am okay with that. I have had a few people who sent more words than was included in their package, though. I don’t know if it is ignorance or if they are just trying to scam me. If I had to guess, I think it is more likely to be the latter.
But, of course, some gigs do require contact beforehand, so it is perfectly fine to specify it in your gig description.
However, I will suggest that you use the Limit Orders in Queue feature. It might be useful for you. You can see a description of it here: https://sellers.fiverr.com/en/article/limiting-orders-in-queue",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 3:36 pm",2020-08-06 23:39:13.790057

I provide copyediting and proofreading services. For my proofreading service, in the gig description, I don’t ask that anyone contacts me beforehand. Anyone can just order from that gig because it’ll likely be around 3k words and that’s nothing.
But for my copyediting gig, it is specifically for fiction novels. I usually get orders that are at least 70k words, and I like to be able to put as much focus on one, max two, at a time because of the varying levels of editing needs for the manuscript. In my gig description, it’s impossible to miss the part where I say the buyer needs to contact me and I need to see the manuscript (or at least some of it) to determine how heavy the copyedit will be. It’s highlighted and in bold.
One morning, I woke up to see that an order had been started on my fiction novel gig. I was already in the middle of editing a 160k-word novel and just starting another smaller one, so seeing that someone had not only gone through my gig and submitted their requirements but had also not even sent me a measly message—man, I was pissed. I had to cancel the order, citing the fact that I had requirements the buyer looked over or ignored. So, of course, it hurt my cancellation rate. I didn’t even bother trying to set up something to work with the buyer after that either, because I don’t want to work with someone who can’t even have enough respect to listen.
I just think it’s incredibly frustrating when buyers can’t even be bothered to read the gig page. I’ve now edited my Requirements section to include a message that states that we’ve already discussed the terms, and if they haven’t, they must cancel the order.
I just ask that buyers actually read the gig page. It’s not there as a backdrop. And it’s especially disappointing when it’s a fellow writer doing it. They should be most in-tune to details when it comes to reading.

If you think your rates are on the low end anyway, another method might be setting higher prices and smaller word counts for the direct order gigs and writing something like ""contact me for a custom offer for xxxx+ words (choose a word count that typically wouldn’t pose too much trouble if someone orders without contacting you) at a rate of (somewhat cheaper than the direct order gig price as incentive to contact you) under certain conditions (file type, need to see file, whatever fits).",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 10:58 am",2020-08-06 23:39:18.602849

What’s The Difference Between Response Time And Response Rate?
Response Rate is the percentage of first responses to new messages that a seller sends within 24 hours. Response Time is the average amount of time in hours that it takes for a seller to send a first response.
How Does The Response Rate Indicator Work?
It tracks the percentage of first responses sent within 24 hours over the last 60 days.
For example, if you received 10 new requests in your inbox in the last 60 days and replied to 9 of them within 24 hours of receiving each one, your response rate is 90%.
Note: if you reply to the last message more than 24 hours after receiving it, your response rate will still be 90%. We recommend that sellers reply even after 24 hours.
Is Every Inbox Message Factored Into My Response Rate?
The Response Rate Indicator tracks your first response to a new message. After that first reply, the rest of the conversation isn’t tracked, although it is important to continue conversations with Buyers until a conclusion is reached.",N/A,"Jun 18, 2018 6:38 am",2020-08-06 23:39:36.458844

Keep in mind that your percentage is affected by your responses on a “rollover basis” — that means that anyone you responded to 61 days ago, or longer, is no longer affecting your personal response percentage. Thus, it’s possible to lose response percentage without even having received a new message, because your ratio of non response to response was lowered because some of your “quick” responses may have moved outside of the 60 day window. I hope that makes sense and helps. As a side note, one thing that helps me is to check “unread” messages in my inbox when I have a large queue to respond to. This ensures I don’t miss any messages from down the line. I have achieved a 100% response rate, so I’m here to tell you it is possible if you remain diligent.

You don’t get to stay where you are just because of your performance. That’s not how algorithms work and that would be no way for Fiverr to run their business. If you think your performance is the only factor that should affect your ranking, you have a lot to learn. This doesn’t at all account for Fiverr’s business goals or competition in the market either. There’s no scenario that means you stay where you are. That’s not how algorithms work and Fiverr would lose business if they operated that…",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 7:21 pm",2020-08-06 23:39:49.945448

Look at this way. The average human being needs about 8 hours sleep every 24 hours.
Imagine if a message came through the moment you went to sleep, and you replied the moment you woke up - that would be an 8 hour response time.
So, 4 hours is actually good.
As @humanissocial has said, you’re allowed a life. In fact, for once, I would go a step further and say as a freelancer, it is vital that you do have a life - and part of that is not stressing about response times.

We had definitely submitted a request for a revision
It’s not possible for the order to autocomplete if it’s in revision. The site is set up in a way that prevents it from happening.
It’s either that the revision was sent as a comment on the order’s page or in the inbox, thus having no effect on the order status and allowing it to autocomplete. Or the seller delivered incomplete work to “close” the revision request and mark the order as complete.
In any case, it takes CS up to 10 days to respond to a ticket these days. If you have a confirmation from the seller that they’ve seen your message and are working on it and then stopped responding, you have a good chance to get this resolved in your favor.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 5:19 pm",2020-08-06 23:40:40.959526

You will receive all your invoices for each purchase by email, once a month, two weeks after the month has ended.

If you want invoices for purchases prior to filling out your billing information, you will need to fill out a support ticket. Please submit a request (please choose “Order Related - Buyer” and use the Category “Other”) with the following information to help create your invoice:

I think it was the outside of Fiverr bit. I’ve had false positives, but after Trust & Safety reviewed the messages, it was a green light for me. Certain words trigger these warnings like pay, email etc… I wouldn’t worry too much, they’ll see that it was harmless, however moving forward just be extra careful.

Be sure not to include competition sites such as UpWork, Guru, Freelancer, Behance,…and or similar since you will get a warning from Fiverr and get demoted. I got demoted when I first start working on Fiverr, 7 years ago. A client asked me to show him my portfolio and I send him a link from one of the previously mentioned sites. Don’t wanna mention it cos I am afraid of demotion lol It was not Fiverr’s support fault since I was automatically flagged by their system. Also, I was a newbie at that time so I wasn’t aware of Fiverr TOS. Fiverr changed greatly from their beginning and I am sure that they will get even better in future.

That while discussing projects details with client. Suddenly client offered him to work for him on the project outside of the fiverr. My friend just simple told him that he will not work outside platform. He will only work if the job is from fiverr or Up* ( You know the word). and withing few second he got warning that his message is under review. Will this get him banned on platform ? or there will be few days suspension ? Can you kindly let me know the information. So I can spread the word because he is too much worried. and also in future I will also stay away from this kind of situation.

Usually if you write a word or phrase that is not allowed, the text box will turn RED and give you a warning that if you continue and send the message, it may be flagged by their Trust and Safety team. If that happens, you want to ERASE what you have written (backspace) until the red disappears OR use common sense and realize if you mentioned anything that can be seen as going off site, your account will get a warning.
I doubt he will get outright banned, but the warning may stay on his account and if he gets 2 more he may get booted. Getting warnings can also hinder your ability to maintain your Level or Level up as well.

Only way to know if he got banned permanently is to ask Fiverr support or trying to log into the account to find it is has been deleted/suspended etc.

So a costumer asked me if freelancing is my full time job. I said yes and that I also have clients outside of Fiverr that I provide with web design services.
Client’s Question: Haha okay! So are you doing instagram and freelancing full time or just on the side?
My Answer: Full time. I also have clients outside of Fiverr that I provide with web design services.
Immediately I received this warning from Fiverr: ‘Your message was flagged for review by our Trust and Safety team, due to possible Terms of Service violation. This process may take up to 24 hours.’
Could this actually ban my account and was my answer somehow against TOS?

I worked so hard for past 7-8 months to reach that level and when it was the time for my account evaluation, my account didn’t got the Top seller Batch even though I met all the Criteria of fiverr which they have mentioned themselves on their analytics page.
And when I raised a ticket about why I didn’t got promoted, Here’s what the replied
""Bear in mind that promotion to that level is not automatic like for levels 1 and 2.
Top Rated Sellers are manually chosen by Fiverr editors. Our editors look at many different factors when choosing Top Rated Sellers, including seniority, volume of sales, exceptional customer care and community leadership, among other criteria.
Our editors look for highly original sellers who have a high volume of sales; provide unique and high quality services; are extremely professional in delivery and communication with buyers; and present their Gigs well, including by using high quality images and videos. To check if your Gigs are original, you can run a quick search on Fiverr.com 1.""
If the top seller is choose by the fiverr itself then why they didn’t mentioned it anywhere on their analytics page?
And what is the criteria to judge that. And does that mean I not a original seller?
My gig’s are well presented, even every buyer of mine gave me 5 star rating even I have buyers who have taken the service from me more than 10 times.
And I did a search for the other top Rated seller to see what their professional gigs look like. And there was no difference even they are selling the same service thrice the price of mine. And you gave them Top Rated Seller batch.
And that isn’t the point why it is not mentioned anywhere? Am I stupid who’s been doing so much hard work even I managed to fulfil all these criteria in just 7-8 months.
This is pure fraud with sellers.
Fiverr just try to motivate their sellers at first by showing all these on their Analytics page and when they work hard to achieve this, this is what the do.
This is really not fair. Even their support services are worst now. They take ages to give a reply.
VERY DISAPPOINTED.",N/A,N/A,N/A,donnovan86,7,"It’s not fraud.
You won’t get a TRS status unless Fiverr believes your work is great. Bashing them on the forum won’t help your cause.
I was TRS for 5 years after losing it due to health issues one month. Honestly there’s no real difference, aside from the fact that you get your money faster.

Top Rated Sellers are manually chosen by Fiverr editors. Our editors look at many different factors when choosing Top Rated Sellers, including seniority, volume of sales, exceptional customer care and community leadership, among other criteria.
Our editors look for highly original sellers who have a high volume of sales; provide unique and high quality services; are extremely professional in delivery and communication with buyers; and present their Gigs well, including by using high quality images and videos. To check if your Gigs are original, you can run a quick search on Fiverr.com 1.""

And what is the criteria to judge that. And does that mean I not a original seller?
My gig’s are well presented, even every buyer of mine gave me 5 star rating even I have buyers who have taken the service from me more than 10 times.

It’s also possible they have too many TRSs in your category.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 2:35 pm",2020-08-06 23:42:12.451462
Didn’t got Promoted to Top Seller Even though all the criteria are completed,Your Fiverr Experience,11,121,48,"Aug 3, 2020 9:38 am","Aug 3, 2020 10:15 am","Aug 3, 2020 2:55 pm",https://forum.fiverr.com/t/didnt-got-promoted-to-top-seller-even-though-all-the-criteria-are-completed/495307,"deepti20, donnovan86, gwyneth_galvin, coerdelion, melanielm, lloydsolutions, mariashtelle1, zeusangs, uk1000",deepti20,3,"So I have completed all the criteria that is required to get the Top Seller batch

Response rate 98%
Order Completion rate 94%
On time Delivery 100%
Rating 5 star
Selling Seniority more than 180 days
Order completed more than 100
Days Without Warnings 30+
I worked so hard for past 7-8 months to reach that level and when it was the time for my account evaluation, my account didn’t got the Top seller Batch even though I met all the Criteria of fiverr which they have mentioned themselves on their analytics page.
And when I raised a ticket about why I didn’t got promoted, Here’s what the replied
""Bear in mind that promotion to that level is not automatic like for levels 1 and 2.
Top Rated Sellers are manually chosen by Fiverr editors. Our editors look at many different factors when choosing Top Rated Sellers, including seniority, volume of sales, exceptional customer care and community leadership, among other criteria.
Our editors look for highly original sellers who have a high volume of sales; provide unique and high quality services; are extremely professional in delivery and communication with buyers; and present their Gigs well, including by using high quality images and videos. To check if your Gigs are original, you can run a quick search on Fiverr.com 1.""
If the top seller is choose by the fiverr itself then why they didn’t mentioned it anywhere on their analytics page?
And what is the criteria to judge that. And does that mean I not a original seller?
My gig’s are well presented, even every buyer of mine gave me 5 star rating even I have buyers who have taken the service from me more than 10 times.
And I did a search for the other top Rated seller to see what their professional gigs look like. And there was no difference even they are selling the same service thrice the price of mine. And you gave them Top Rated Seller batch.
And that isn’t the point why it is not mentioned anywhere? Am I stupid who’s been doing so much hard work even I managed to fulfil all these criteria in just 7-8 months.
This is pure fraud with sellers.
Fiverr just try to motivate their sellers at first by showing all these on their Analytics page and when they work hard to achieve this, this is what the do.
This is really not fair. Even their support services are worst now. They take ages to give a reply.

They should reply or even tell us that they are also trying to reach out to the buyer. But giving no reply is not a solution my dear. You issue got resolved.

If the Fiverr can’t do anything then they should change their name from fiverr support to something else. Because they give support from nowhere.

One month and a half ago I’ve been contacted from the Fiverr editorial team directly in Fiverr via chat from a user named “editor_picks”. They have basically offered me the chance to apply to the new Fiverr business. Here below part of the message (I didn’t include the interview questions):
> Because of your professionalism and skills we want to introduce Fiverr Business - a new environment built for bigger businesses and companies on Fiverr. This is an interesting opportunity to work with bigger clients, leverage your expertise, and gain all the benefits that come with it. Fiverr Business is focused on business-related services and we are building a dedicated business catalog for Fiverr Business companies to choose from. In order for us to better understand your professional match and eligibility, we’d like to ask that you answer the following questions on video:
The also said to look out for an email to gain more information about this opportunity. I never received this email and asked them why I didn’t received it but it seems they didn’t care too much. I then asked to prove their profile, I really didn’t want to send this video to a stranger.
Once they have proofed it, I decided then to go ahead and prepare the video for them (even though the only information I had were what I attached above, not very clear) and sent everything to them.
Once they have received the video, their answers was “great, thank you!” nothing else, they didn’t let me know what was next until I asked them. They then said “We will review your video, and you will be contacted via email later on with further information.” Then 1 week after they have said it would had take few weeks to get a result.
I then decided to wait, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, and nothing. No email, no messages. I sent another message asking what was happening, if they had any news and how long would take roughly to receive a result, but they didn’t reply to me anymore.
The reason why I’m writing this is because I wanted to know if this happened to anyone already and if the fiver editorial team had the same attitude. The only thing that annoys me most is that I wasted half day to make this video even though were 3/4 minutes but I really thought this was a good occasion to grow in Fiverr and wanted to do good. At the end, my feeling is that Fiverr Editorial didn’t care too much and just wanted to receive my video for some reasons, they didn’t get back to me with a yes or a no! Does it really take so long to review a 3 minutes video? Did this happened to any of you already?",N/A,N/A,N/A,"catwriter
Regular",1,"mattdesigner:
Does it really take so long to review a 3 minutes video?
One video, no, but how many sellers have they contacted? How many videos they need to review, and then choose the best candidates?
(Just guessing here, of course, but it seems logical; remember that it took them months to review Pro applications)",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 1:46 pm",2020-08-06 23:42:58.597408

So, here is the story.
I worked for a guy remotely on his MAC a few days ago and didn’t created an offer.
So i did his work first, created an offer but he said but he is unable to process payment. He used Paypal and told me that all of his cards are denied. I didn’t got any notification that whether my offer is accepted or not.

Then why did he said that i will pay outside the platform. What should i do now ? Should i ask him to pay outside the platform?
What would i get ? A banned account due to TOS. We sellers cannot ask for anything! This is a big flaw.
The flaw here unfortunately is that you provided him the work before he placed an order with you.
Regrettably, I agree with what invaderroxas said earlier -
invaderroxas:
There is no reasonable situation where you do the work first, then have payment process afterwards. That is not how Fiverr works, and I would take this as a lesson moving forward

The best advice would be to not use canned responses and write the offer yourself, to sound like it was meant for that buyer alone and not a general offer you copy-paste. But! (ofc there’s a but) If you do that, you will sometimes end up writing your offer and the moment you click the send button, it will say in red “Oops, something went wrong. Try again (or something)” That’s when he can’t receive more offers and it’s gone. So maybe try to write some part of the offer yourself (maybe the beginning) and continue with the copy-paste to fill in your expertise, what you offer and your portfolio, if you have/need one.

Your argument also doesn’t mean more time on Fiverr equals a greater likelihood of orders just like ordering more lottery tickets doesnt make it more likely you will win.
Buyers want what they want and you being online a lot doesn’t change that, especially if thousands of other sellers are also trying to stay online.
And I don’t understand how you can tell people this is how it is if you have little experience selling here. Regardless, your logic doesn’t work.
People would sell things if they learned their market and designed gigs around that instead of doing these silly tricks.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 3:11 am",2020-08-06 23:44:47.921939

The exact amounts that they have offered or more/less?
Usually offer <= the budget amount. It depends on the request. If you think they’re asking too much work for the budget specified you could make an offer for higher than it.
It depends what is written in the request/how it is written. The higher the budget they put, the more you could maybe put a lower offer. It might depend on how easily (how much work is involved) you could do what they are asking, etc. But some buyers might think too low an offer is not serious.
Another issue is you can’t (shouldn’t) create an offer for a higher price than your gig price if you’re not offering more things in the offer than they’d get in your gig by buying it directly.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 8:56 am",2020-08-06 23:45:09.163205

If the buyer’s amount is ridiculously low, don’t bid. They aren’t serious and will treat you like garbage. It won’t be worth your time. Good chance they’re cancel on you.
If the price point is reasonable, then charge them what you think it’s worth. If it should be a bit more, charge that and explain it. If it’s slightly less, then charge that.
As a buyer, I find it disingenuous when sellers bid the exact amount. What are the chances? When I click on the gig, almost all of them are charging up to $60 LESS.
Why would I pay $60 more when I can order straight from their gig page. I find that to be dishonest.
Before someone says, maybe its because I’m asking more than their gig, I’m not. “I need a 500 word article on xyz.” Pretty straight forward.
Whatever you charge is what you get. Example, if you charge $100:
Buyer pays: $100 + $5 (processing) = $105.
Seller gets: $100 - $20 (seller fee) = $80.
Fiver gets: $5 (processing) + $20 (seller fee) = $25.
You have to convert if you don’t use U.S. currency.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 9:58 am",2020-08-06 23:45:09.548701

The worst Customer support Ever,Your Fiverr Experience,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/the-worst-customer-support-ever/495292,N/A,seoembassy,,"It’s been more than 18 days that my 2-3 orders are late, Because the buyers ordered the gig and then they didn’t replied to a single message they didn’t even came online to review. So I asked customer support to cancel the order from their side, as it is effecting my completion rate. But here’s how their services work, I requested them to cancel the order when it was only 2-3 days late, and now it’s been 18 days I haven’t received any reply from them, All I got was the automated reply that they some of their support member will reply to my query within 10 days. I waited and now that I see they marked the support ticked as solved. How??
My order is still late, they buyers doesn’t cares because they have nothing to lose but my whole profile is getting affected. How can the fiverr Support mark them as solved when they didn’t even replied to my request. And now i can’t reply on the same ticket as it has been solved according to them.
So I opened another ticket and 2 days later after my 2 messages I got automated reply that my query that they will response in 10 business days, are you really kidding me, My order is already 18 days late and I should wait again for 10 days and no idea they will response or not just like they did to my previous request.
Fiverr customer support is the worst, Their services are getting worst day by day. Here we are doing are 100% to grow our account and this is the service they provide to their seller.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,2020-08-06 23:45:28.427091

We usually just advise people to listen to the demos on our page, or send them our showreels if they insist on having something downloadable.
I’d bet money that whenever this is happening to you, your demo is one of many that the client has collected to send to their client to audition. Their client picks their favourite, informs your buyer, and your buyer engages that seller. If they’re professional, they might come back and let you know that your demo wasn’t picked, but most don’t.
We’ve actually had to block someone recently, as we realised they’d asked for a demo 8 times over the past couple of years, but never actually bought anything.

To be fair, if I, as a buyer, would have managed to place an order by mistake, I’d be okay with waiting a few days for support to cancel, but the decision whether to just cancel and be done with it, or to ask support to cancel, and tell your customer by mistake that you declined the cancellation request to let support cancel it and refund them, is up to you.
Whatever you do, I’d avoid in any case to tell the buyer anything like “my rating will go down”, etc.; if you can’t deal with this issue without any of that, it’s definitely better to cancel and hope that support will correct your order completion rate later when they get around to your ticket, or to take the hit, if they won’t.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 7:14 am",2020-08-06 23:46:46.067219

You could ask if they can enter a different payment method in case that would work. If you don’t dispute the cancellation it might cancel in 2 days and it might be too late for CS to do anything about it given their long response times currently. You could accept the dispute but that would mean CS would probably not be able to do anything about it and it would affect your stats.
So ideally get CS to cancel it without it affecting your stats due to it not being your fault but they may or may not do it and it may be too late to do it with their current response time.
So maybe try and get them to do a different payment method and try and get CS to cancel it without affecting your stats if that doesn’t work. But it might be too late unless you decline the cancellation one or more times.

Can you please share your experience as a seller on fiverr. What should someone do to get orders regularly?
Thanks for the quote. To be honest I am not sure how am I so lucky that once my order luck got opened it never stopped for even a single day. There might be two reasons, I guess. Firstly, my gigs are performing good because of search engine optimization that I researched for almost a month about the fiverr marketplace and its gig algorithm. And secondly Though I have 5 gigs, I got most of the orders on my Online Course Curriculum and Course Content Development gigs (as I am an online course developer) that is trending worldwide. But to my surprise I found a few competitor in my category, But good news for me is that there are thousands of buyers who are in search of online course developer. And that market gap is still bringing my fortune.
Apart from that, I trry to be online as many hours as possible, remain communicative and decent at a time while dealing buyers and obviously deliver original and quality content within the deadline. Thats a brief about my journey. Hope that helps.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 10:38 am",2020-08-06 23:48:41.648411

I never experienced something like this, so I am not sure how it works. What I mean, is that if the timer still doesn’t stop, I may get a negative review automatically.

arnukas:
Could the order be marked as Very Late while the cancellation is in dispute?
I guess that could happen with support’s current response times.
The 1* standard review one sometimes sees on profiles (Order was cancelled, seller didn’t deliver on time) isn’t automatic in so far as the buyer has to cancel for it to happen but it’s automatic in so far that the buyer can’t do anything against that review happening if they cancel.
Your buyer will get the option to cancel one-sidedly once the order gets in “Very Late” status, and then, if they cancel, the “automatic” 1* review happens. I’ve had that situation once, when I made an order and the seller apparently had abandoned their account, never delivered nor reacted to messages, so finally, I cancelled to get my money refunded. I wouldn’t even have wanted to leave a review, because I didn’t know if maybe the seller had gone or been taken to a hospital, or something similar or worse happened, but when I cancelled, that review happened, I couldn’t choose if or how to review.
If he doesn’t accept your cancellation request, there’s not much reason for him to cancel when the order goes very late either, but you never know, of course, maybe he knows that buyers typically can’t leave a review when orders get cancelled but that that automatic review will happen if the order gets very late, or he could change his mind.
arnukas:
But I also afraid that he would reject the cancellation request.
I think if the buyer neither accepts not declines your cancellation request within some time frame, the order will automatically be cancelled? And if he’d reject, I think you could send a new request? So that specific thing doesn’t seem to be anything to be much afraid of.
I hope that in your case, with the buyer breaching ToS with asking for off-platform contact and threatening you and all, CS would reset your order completion and delivered on time stats, but you never know. I’d keep an eye on any notifications and deadlines that you might need to react to (for example, if he declines the cancellation, send a new request right away) and ignore any weird messages.
Hopefully, support will react soon, I don’t see any further actions that you could take from your side, for now, so try to relax and stay calm. Don’t do him the favour of feeling terrible, in any case. It’s a mere annoyance that will pass soon.",N/A,"Aug 3, 2020 3:20 am",2020-08-06 23:48:58.155679

To be honest in your place I would’ve contact CS anyway. He is blackmailing you and most likely he is blackmailing other sellers.
If you will let it go right now he will think that it’s ok and will do it to other sellers.

You may have had an extremely rare experience where you remarkably hired the same person, with two different accounts (especially if it was in the same service category). While this is completely against the rules for any user (i.e., having more than one account), it is far more likely from new users who usually ignor the rules, and have no seller reputation. Not all of us brand developers are like this.
I find it highly unlikely as well, that two different sellers (if they were two different sellers) would provide the same exact work. That just doesn’t happen – on the level you described.
Please don’t let the bad experiences drive you away. There are many great sellers here on Fiverr. With better pre-order research, and maybe even a more experienced seller (with better social proof), you are likely to avoid this happening again. Be wise not to hire the cheapest sellers as well. Sellers that undersell themselves – at rock-bottom levels – often blend in more with the troublesome buyers you don’t want to hire.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 5:29 pm",2020-08-06 23:51:35.214782

What, exactly do you want CS to say? The official statement, from the Seller Help Center, that @vibronx already quoted, IS the same answer CS would tell you. You are not going to get the answer you seek, if that answer doesn’t match how Fiverr works. Fiverr is what it is. If you want to obtain more orders and success, than this might be a good time to take responsibility for that success, and do what you need to do in order to reach out to your target customers, and convince them to hire you.
It is unwise to expect the rapidly changing Fiverr search system to provide all of your orders.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 5:36 pm",2020-08-06 23:51:44.215862

when you have a task that you have as little as one day to compete, why not be able to gather all the info needed in as little as 20 minutes. As opposed to receiving the instruction file, follow up with a question. Wait to hear a reply, follow up with another question.
If you need time to gather more information, why not set a longer order delivery time on your gig? It always baffles me why so many sellers think they have to offer their services in only 24 hours.
mazzyverses:
Wait to hear a reply, follow up with another question. Buyer has already signed off, went to lunch, etc, see your question 2-3 hours later then responds. Another follow up question, another few hours pass and half the day is gone.
You can already see when a buyer is responding in the messaging system. It’s already a live system. A different live system seems extraneous. Buyers have lives and time restrictions as well. The current system allows for back and forth communication – as time allows. Like I said, if your service requires more of a back and forth level of communication, give your services more time for communication. There is no need to rush services and communication just to get everything done in under 24 hours. As an example, my standard delivery is seven days, and that seems to work just fine for my process, and for the clients who hire me.
Set your gigs to allow time to manage them effectively. There is no need to rush. Buyers would rather have a seller take the time to produce full, complete, quality work, rather than do a rush job in order to beat a 1-day deadline.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 4:25 pm",2020-08-06 23:52:18.704306

Regular",4,"I strongly suggest you delete your ‘video marketing’ gig as it is against Fiverr’s Community Standards to promise a certain number of followers and to offer fake engagement. It is also very dishonest.
From the Community Standards:
“In certain instances, sellers may be tempted to promise outcomes of their service which is not in their control. For example, guaranteeing to restore your Amazon account or promising an exact amount of viewers for a Youtube video by its digital promotion. Please refrain from promising outcomes that are not in your control because it misleads buyers.”
""Do not post, offer or ask for:
Followers, subscribers, fans or views on social media platforms.
Fake engagement on any platform.""
Read the Community Standard here:
https://www.fiverr.com/community/standards
Also, your buyer mentions a Zoom call in their review. Communication outside of Fiverr is a violation of ToS and can lead to a warning unless you have gotten permission from Customer Support.
From the Terms of Service:
“To protect our users’ privacy, user identities are kept anonymous. Requesting or providing Email addresses, ■■■■■/IM usernames, telephone numbers or any other personal contact details to communicate outside of Fiverr in order to circumvent or abuse the Fiverr messaging system or Fiverr platform is not permitted.”

You still didn’t delete your video marketing gig even though you said you would do so 8 hours ago.
I will again strongly suggest that you delete it immediately. You are only making it more likely that someone is going to report it, and then you will have earned yourself a warning.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 2:23 pm",2020-08-06 23:52:58.145027

You should not accept a video call from a buyer unless you have gotten permission from Customer Support to offer video calls. It should also be clearly stated in your gig description and your order requirements that a call is necessary to complete the order.
Buyers can break ToS too. You should not automatically assume that everything a buyer does is in your best interest.",N/A,"Aug 2, 2020 2:44 pm",2020-08-06 23:52:59.504596
