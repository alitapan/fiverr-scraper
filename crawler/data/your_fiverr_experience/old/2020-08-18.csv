I think plenty of sellers sell/have sold pre-made products they created themselves (eg. documents), including TRS.
The “service” in this case (like many) would have surely been delivering what the buyer had asked/paid for.
humanissocial:
Just because other people getting away with breaking the ToS, that doesn’t justify you doing it.
Fiverr didn’t say that selling PLR goods was against the TOS (in the actual TOS or a policy page) or was
not one of the services allowed.
The fact that there were >1200 gigs selling PLR and those gigs were approved by Fiverr staff/moderators would surely have made the OP think they were allowed. If Fiverr approved those gigs and nothing is said against those types of services in the TOS or anywhere else by Fiverr, why shouldn’t he think they are allowed? If they aren’t allowed Fiverr shouldn’t have said “yes this gig is allowed” over 1200 times for that same service.
edit: If selling PLR is against their rules shouldn’t Fiverr have just added a new rule to their automated checks to check for “PLR” in the gig title and so made future checks of gigs a lot easier/quicker?
Disabling the account for something the OP didn’t know and wasn’t told and was led to believe was allowed (by what Fiverr did in approving 1200 gigs) is probably too much of a punishment really. Why not give a warning at most or just let them know that that it isn’t allowed if that’s the case?",N/A,"Aug 15, 2020 3:33 am",2020-08-18 20:48:53.691717

They want to make bank, obviously, but they don’t force anyone to buy or sell here, and, as urdeke pointed out, the fees are clear; when you sign up for an account, you’re supposed to have read and agree to the terms, and the fees are clearly stated. I’ll rather keep my personal “evil” label for other things.
I do agree that it seems a lot if you look at the percent of the low-value orders like $5. However, I see it this way: Fiverr has a theoretical/average overhead per order.
There are associated costs for Fiverr, like the general costs to operate Fiverr, transactional costs they have with their payment providers/gateways, etc., which are distributed throughout the orders/fees, and then there are additional costs that happen when something goes wrong with an order.
In this case, let’s say customer support needs to spend 1 hour on a $5 order vs. on a $100 order, or a $1000 order, it makes sense to me that the fee is higher (percent-wise) for low-value orders than high(er)-value orders. In addition to that, going from what you often read on the forum, it’s highly possible that, on average, low-value orders create more work for support than high-value orders.
It’s about the same reason that you’ll virtually be bullied out of some popular Parisian street cafés if you sit around for too long with just a cup of coffee, they either need/want several people per hour sitting at that same table with a cup of coffee each, or one person who buys a can of cocoa, a croissant and a petit-four during that hour - or to sell you a rather expensive coffee or cocoa … which they’d never even dream of doing … right?
It makes sense, too, I know how it is to be an entrepreneur and run a business, I won’t hang around a busy café in the city center with high rent for an unreasonably long time, or occupy a table in a busy restaurant and just drink a glass of water.
(disclaimer: the last paragraph was just to add a bit of fun, and I’ve never been bullied out of one of the great Parisian street cafés by one of the extremely polite and friendly garçons … or have I … )",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 3:10 am",2020-08-18 20:49:07.184816

Anyway I think they could pull a lot more customers from third world countries if they had a flat fee for their orders below $40. I assume a lot of people from the poorer countries would place $5 - $30 orders.

From business point of view, if Apple puts more normal prices on their phones and everything everyone would buy it, but they are keeping the prices unrealistically stupid for decades.

Frankly, from a business perspective, I can see 5r’s POV. By raising the admin/transaction fees, they are doing two things:
Cost of doing business for lower cost clients will equal out to higher cost buyers
Encourages people to buy higher cost gigs
It worked, because I don’t buy any gigs under $20 these days. Most of the time, I buy gigs priced at $40 & more.

May I repeat this once again: @gina_riley2 is correct, and you and and @jake_hopkins are wrong!
You can’t just use, let alone add, percentages in such a happy way.
To start with, the total amount of money from where Fiverr takes its share isn’t $5, but $7. YOU are paying $7 for the order, not $5. So $7 is the base from where you have to make your math.

No, they don’t. Once again, your math is incorrect. The fee is not part of the $5 cost. This is why a buyer pays $7 for a $5 gig. $5 gig + $2 fee = $7.
Fiverr is still earning only 20% of the gig cost, taken out of the seller’s earnings (i.e., $1, in the case of a $5 gig). The $2 buyer fee will be the same, on every order price up to $40.

Fiverr, is, does, and will always only keep only 20% of the total gig purchase cost from the seller’s earnings. Fiverr never keeps more than 20%. The seller always keeps the remaining 80%. I don’t understand why this concept is so hard to understand. Sellers agree to a profit-sharing model where Fiverr keeps 20% of the gig cost, and the buyer keeps the remaining 80%. This is a flat sharing model.
Every buyer pays an additional administration fee of $2 on every up-to $40 order price, and if the order price goes over $40, the buyer pays an added 5% of the cost.

Why a Buyer should complain as tho they are being uniquely disadvantaged when they have to support that platform I am not sure. Sellers are supporting it very heavily too.
Fiverr are most likely trying to encourage people away from peanut jobs as while they seem attractive, they encourage poor outcomes not only in terms on income but quality of work. This is mostly likely the greatest cause for negativity around the whole online freelancer thing.
Instead of scrimping and thinking how clever you are to get all that work done (often poorly) for $5, see how much better it would be to get better results if you invested $50. Not only will your seller be more invested in getting you better results, but you get those better results and better loyalty. This is how good businesses are built.

Either use PayPal (no fees for me) or wait for a bunch of orders to finish approval before you withdraw.
The fee for direct deposit is $1, and that can now be negated since you get $4 instead.
Fiverr overall takes 42.857% of the money involved.
Math: 100 - [ ( 4 / 7 ) * 100 ] = 42.85714
If you make a ten dollar order (which is a lot more common honestly):
100 - [ ( 8 / 12 ) * 100 ] = 33.333…
Or fifteen:
100 - [ ( 12 / 17 ) * 100 ] = 29.41176
If you create a formula to find the percentage taken at large numbers (Including the 5% interest above $40):
lim_n 100 - { [ 4n / (( 5n + 2 ) + ( 0.5 * 5n ) ] * 100 }
Plug this in as the value n approaches infinity, and you find a trend:
lim_n-> inf = 23.80953

Frankly, from a business perspective, I can see 5r’s POV. By raising the admin/transaction fees, they are doing two things:
Cost of doing business for lower cost clients will equal out to higher cost buyers
Encourages people to buy higher cost gigs
It worked, because I don’t buy any gigs under $20 these days. Most of the time, I buy gigs priced at $40 & more.
Because of (2), Fiverr earns more on those higher value orders.

Don’t expect to be hand-picked for “Featured” status, because it will likely never happen. But if it does – if Fiverr staff likes your gig enough to tell others about it – then appreciate the honor.
Work on things that YOU can control. You cannot control what Fiverr staff likes. Nor does being featured actually provide many benefits. It does not hold the status that it once had, back when Fiverr was a smaller site with more unique gigs.",N/A,"Aug 17, 2017 1:49 am",2020-08-18 20:50:29.247306

Tips for Sellers
If you want more orders, here’s what you need to do: You need to research, understand, and reach out to your target customers. You need to Study, Understand, and Connect. The only people who will hire you, are the people who need your services. So, if you want them to hire you, you need to understand who they are, what they like, and and what they need. Then, you need to determine how your valuable skills can solve their needs. I’ll say that again – THEIR NEEDS, not your needs – not what you wa…

I joined on the 5th of August, that will make it 2 weeks tomorrow.
I received my first order on the second day which i completed with a 5-Star review from the client. I’m sure i’d be hearing from him again *Fingers crossed
Got my second order 7 days after that after i sent a buyer’s request.
This particular client wasn’t as easy to work with as the first because she didn’t communicate her idea properly with the references she sent and i had to work on it about 3 times. Added to that she was paying a lot less than my first gig. I didn’t take the job for money but to build my clientele base and possibly another positive review.
I finally completed the gig her specification and i managed to deliver with over a day to spare.
I figure she was happy with my delivery as she promised to have another task for me next week. Only, i never got a review from this delivery. I must admit i was disappointed because that was one of the major reasons i agreed to her price.
Anyways, i might get one next time we work together.
I’m currently looking forward to working on my 3rd order and i hope i can connect with someone who i’d enjoy working with, who will be willing to pay good money for my services and who will leave me a good review afterwards.

please leave a comment.",N/A,N/A,N/A,english_voice,1,"In my opinion sellers should not do jobs cheaply expecting to receive feedback.
There are three very good reasons why:
As a seller you cannot even mention the word ‘feedback’ to your buyer. Doing so can result in an account warning or suspension.
Just because you offer a cheap price it doesn’t mean a buyer will leave feedback. They’re not a mindreader. Buyers are under no obligation to feedback.
Because of points 1 and 2, by offering a cheap price you are only cheating yourself out of earning more money.

One quick bit of advice from someone who’s been here a long time, don’t let buyers tell you things like “I’ll pay more next time if you do this job cheap” or “If you can also do XYZ then I’ll leave you a tip” or “I need a free sample”.

Helping to prepare academic work is against the Terms of Service at the bottom of the Fiverr main page.
Such gigs are likely to be removed at any time.
Make sure to carefully read the Terms of Service as a violation can risk your account.
Unethical Services
Fiverr’s marketplace is open for sellers to offer any creative and productive service they wish to propose. With that being said, we ask to refrain from offering any unethical service. For example, taking part in doing someone else’s academic work (which will likely be submitted as the student’s own work) or requesting academic work to be done for you, is unethical since it violates most schools’ Honor Codes and constitutes copyright infringement. Fiverr does not allow this type of fraudulent activities and it will not be permitted on our platform.

The weather is hot during the day (around 27-30 degrees), and cold at night (it can be even 7 degrees). Baltic Sea is cold in general, and water temperature is 18-22 degrees, but it’s totally fine for me. It’s like going to Spain in October.
However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

First of all, it’s a part of my (and many other people’s) childhood .
It’s a very interesting and cautionary tale.
The story follows the experiences of a mongoose named Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (from his chattering vocalizations) after he becomes the pet of a British family residing in India. He becomes friendly with some of the other creatures inhabiting the garden and is warned of the cobras Nag and Nagaina, who are angered by the human family’s presence on their territory.

Mainly a seller’s gig is ranked according to how well their gig performs and the seller’s stats I think, as well it would be based on some SEO - the gig would be matched to searches based on what’s in the title, description, tags etc. and anything else Fiver puts into their search ranking algorithm (like showing Fiverr’s Choice gigs close to the top of the results).",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 5:21 pm",2020-08-18 20:54:52.950723

Your gigs are in a niche that is heavily competitive. There are 35,312 other gigs for logo design. 92.434 of the sellers that offer logo design are new sellers.
With those odds, it is surprising you got one gig since you have been here only 1 month.

Your gig pricing makes no business sense. You have three packages:
5 images = $3 each
7 images = $4.29 each
10 images = $4.50 each
Instead of making it cheaper the more someone buys, you are actually making it more expensive - thus going against common sense. Your pricing structure is crazy. If you can’t see this, or understand this, you are not ready to run your own business.
For example, I can either buy one 10 image gig for $45 or I can buy two 5 image gigs for $30. It makes no sense whatsoever.
You offer 24/7 consultation. What, you don’t sleep? Be real. Don’t fake it.
You talk about HD quality. In Britain HD quality means 1920 x1080 pixels, which is actually very low resolution by photographic standards.
You offer ‘delivery on time’. I should think so. This shouldn’t be a selling point though!
You offer ‘unlimited revisions’. How many times do sellers need to be told this is a terrible, terrible idea.
While your English can be understood, it is full of grammar errors.
There are thousands of other sellers on Fiverr offering what you do for so much cheaper. You are offering to edit 10 images for $45 when there are some sellers offering to edit 100 images for $5.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 3:47 pm",2020-08-18 20:55:10.436763

For the gig text:
Gig: I will graphic design for facebook cover photo and banners
In the gig description:
“For an I cathing design” could be “For an eye-catching design”
Gig: I will graphic design for a media kit, flyer, and one page
In the basic package “upto” could be “up to”
I’m not sure starting the gig titles with “I will graphic design…” is best but I may be wrong.
Also in some of the gigs you say “Why I am and Why This GIG” - I’m not sure if you mean “Who I am and…” there, or at least maybe change the “Why I am” bit.
For the buyer request offers - search for forum threads about the best way to respond to them. eg. making sure your offer describes how you can do exactly what the buyer is asking (ie. no template offers). Threads on how to send the best offers might be the most help if they’re not responding.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 4:24 pm",2020-08-18 20:55:29.778284

No. You can have chargebacks even if you have withdrawn the earnings from your orders. It would show a negative balance in your earnings which would cause future earnings to be taken from you until the chargeback was paid.

Just don’t buy one if you use Linux as the graphic card compatibility is a nightmare.
As a second best buy, the Microsoft Surface RT 2 and original Pro model go cheap and as well as matching the hardware specs of later models like the Surface 3, have great battery life. - the only problem is that you can’t do anything but use MS office and browse the net on internet Explorer.

It’s a real problem for me. I stick to ones which are 12 or 13 inches for this reason. I have an Alienware I love that is incredibly reliable. I tried getting a new one and had to send it back because they changed the keyboard and it was too difficult to type.

I started back in 2011 with a decked out macbook pro. Absolutely loved it. It’s worth the price for how long it actually lasts. I bought it new for $2500 and sold it in 2017 for $750 to buy a new laptop. I switched to Dell Inspiron laptop so I could put more money into the processor/memory versus paying for the Apple name. About a year and a half ago I migrated to a desktop setup just because of the amount of work and time spent on my computer.
My tower was Lenovo 510A and my two monitors are 27"" Acers. I recently upgraded my tower again to iBuyPower for the upgraded graphics card (nvidia gforce rtx 2080), intel core i7 and
16gb ram (upgrade capability to 32gb). My new computer runs my programs like a dream (Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop at the same time, no lag time).
I know this is long winded, lol. But it’s really dependent on what you plan to use your computer for. Using Adobe products, I recommend at least 16gb of memory along with at least an intel i7 processor. There’s nothing more infuriating than when you think/move faster than your program can handle.

I am using HP core i5, 4 GB RAM, Operating System: Windows 10, AMD Radeon Graphics.",N/A,1,"Jul 1, 2017 5:18 pm",cyaxrex,2,"official_nomi:
My budget is $1000. But I can manage up to $1200.
To be honest, I’d go the cheap and cheerful route. Most high-end laptops still come with just i5 or i7 processors. I picked an i5 Dell laptop up a couple of years ago second hand from eBay. It was an ex-business laptop which I got for £150 with 8GB ram. I’ve since upgraded it with an SSD and 16GB of ram and it is more than fit for purpose. If need be, I can upgrade the processor and ram further, thanks to the fact that it is easy to dismantle.
Where I live, if I was to buy a new i5 laptop with my specs, it would still cost me $800 - $1,000.
For work, I use a heavily customized linux distro. However, because I need to run some Windows video editing apps, I also have a Windows tablet. (This also lets me have a portable workstation.) At first I used a MS Surface and actually went through 3 Surface models, one of which I bought new. Sadly, all were huge let downs. After a few months of use, all developed problems with their charging ports.
In the end, I gave up on using a tablet. However, last year I picked up a linx 12x64, which is basically a Surface clone with lower specs. (Quad core Atom processor and 4GB ram). It was a bargain at $150. However, it was very slow and the battery life was a measly 6-hours.
Recently, I got bored and decided to hack the thing to death. I replaced Windows 10 with Windows 8, and installed a lightweight linux distro alongside Windows. When plugged in on my desk, I boot Windows 8 and run the video editing apps I need to. When I’m out and about, I boot linux and get 12-14-hours of battery life, and all the functionality I need to write on the go and do basic web browsing.
My approach doesn’t work for everyone. However, I find that buying refurbished and second hand tech makes more sense economically than buying the newest laptop or desktop. The specs of a lot of older business laptops are comparable to new laptops today and having a bigger chassis means that it is easy to upgrade components.
In short, never look at the price tag, but do always look at the specs!",N/A,"Apr 3, 2019 6:17 pm",2020-08-18 20:57:21.505018

It’s not my main computer for work (I have a customized Mac Mini + Dell monitor as a main desktop workstation) but as far as the laptops go, it’s great. I use it when I work out of home or travel. It’s reasonably quick and fits any backpack.
I would recommend 15” screen model for those who want to use it as the only computer for design work, though. 13” can get a bit uncomfortable sometimes.",N/A,"Aug 12, 2019 11:57 am",2020-08-18 20:57:25.462063

They are OK with Photoshop, but not with 3D Max for example.
That’s because the apps for 3D are CPU dependant and the mobile chips designer for laptops don’t have the necessary power for rendering. Although, if you utilize your GPU (some apps allow) a gaming laptop would be perfect.
If you want fast rendering, you need to go with the Intel Xtreme-Series of processors or the AMD Threadripper ones.
ldnarquitectura:
They are OK with Photoshop
I do agree with this. That’s because photoshop is optimized to use just two cores - and it benefits from clock speeds.
Although, it depends on the task.
uk1000:
But even so, maybe the laptop limits the CPU speed (if it could go as fast as a desktop) so that it doesn’t overheat.
Well, a laptop or a desktop computer that has a bad thermal design (not enough airflow or just bad cooling) would make the CPU throttle. So in order for the fans to achive “optimal” temperature, the CPU downcloks its boost clock.

I started my career as a subtitler in Fiverr a few months ago. By now, I had a few clients and they were always happy with my deliveries.
But now I have a client that asked for a .srt file, which I delivered on time, but he claims that the format of the subtitles is not good for his video. He is using Premiere Pro, trying to burn the subtitles to his video, and he says they are formated for 720x480 and he needs them for a 1920x1080 resolution.
I explained to him that .srt files have no format, so I can’t do anything about it, and actually tried to help him researching about Premiere Pro. Turns out that platform has a problem with the 1920x1080 subtitles, so I explained to him that it’s a platform problem and he should try another one, but he won’t accept my order.

What should I do?
This is always a difficult position to be in. You’ve done your job, and gone above-and-beyond to figure out what the buyer’s problem was after you finished. Honestly, it’s not your job to fix his problem. Maybe you should state this outright.
“I’m sorry you’re having problems with your program. I have finished your order to the original scope. If you are unwilling to change platforms/programs, then I would be willing to do the embedding for you for an additional $15USD.”
(Or, whatever you charge per-minute, for the length of his vid.)

I started my career as a subtitler in Fiverr a few months ago. By now, I had a few clients and they were always happy with my deliveries.
But now I have a client that asked for a .srt file, which I delivered on time, but he claims that the format of the subtitles is not good for his video. He is using Premiere Pro, trying to burn the subtitles to his video, and he says they are formated for 720x480 and he needs them for a 1920x1080 resolution.
I explained to him that .srt files have no format, so I can’t do anything about it, and actually tried to help him researching about Premiere Pro. Turns out that platform has a problem with the 1920x1080 subtitles, so I explained to him that it’s a platform problem and he should try another one, but he won’t accept my order.
Any subtitler had a similar problem? What should I do?

Fiverr… has a poor reputation of ignoring that line in the ToS, if the buyer contacts Customer Support first. It’s the Anchoring Cognitive Bias effect.
You might want to submit a ticket to CS yourself.
“I have recently completed and delivered an order to scope. There are some problems on the buyer’s end, and I’ve gone above-and-beyond the scope of the order to help the buyer rectify the issue. The buyer is demanding I cancel. At this time, I am attempting to work things out with the buyer, and wish to inform CS that I do not want this order canceled.

Tips for Sellers
For those of you who do not know me or those of you lurking the threads without logging on; take it from a buyer - know how to say “NO!” If you spend any time reading these forums, you’ll find plenty of posts where a seller, typically new - but not always, say they were scammed or the buyer is holding them hostage. They are literally begging forum members, to help them with a really bad scam artist, who is threatening them with bad reviews or giving them a sob story to get things for free.

You say you never violate terms and conditions, but you also say you’ve had three warnings. So, clearly you do violate terms and conditions. Most sellers with three warnings are suspended, if you believe what’s written in the forums.
You were probably picked up for including the handle @phonesinprofit . This will likely be viewed by Fiverr as a way to contact buyers outside of the platform, which of course is not allowed and will result in a warning. It’s either an Instagram or Twitter account.
Also, why are you doing work without a proper order being placed by the client? If the client wants extra work done, then they make a new order, or it becomes a gig extra. Often buyers who say they will leave a tip are liars - they say it as an incentive to get you to do the work, and then they never pay it. Fiverr could potentially view this as a breach of TOS as well.
I’m sorry to say that there is nothing that anyone on this forum can do to assist you. If you are lucky enough to survive a third warning, you really do need understand the terms of service better and you need to run your business more professionally. You don’t do work unless an order is in place - no matter what the reason is.",N/A,"Aug 18, 2020 2:40 pm",2020-08-18 20:58:33.710507
