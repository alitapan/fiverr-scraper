You say you‚Äôve prepared everything but for example, your gig covers look like they could‚Äôve been done in PowerPoint, but the gig claims you‚Äôre using Photoshop.
On one of your gigs you start off by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new to Fiverr‚Äù, why not start off with the experience you DO have, instead of the experience you don‚Äôt? You also mention ‚ÄúHopefully I‚Äôll be able to meet your needs‚Äù, but being hopeful isn‚Äôt going to get me the product I‚Äôd want as a buyer, it says to me you aren‚Äôt confident in what you‚Äôre selling.
Lastly, I believe there are tests you can take through the profile section for free to verify your knowledge, people can filter sellers based on this, and if you haven‚Äôt verified your knowledge then you aren‚Äôt going to show up. I took the time to verify my languages and customer service, and in the last two weeks I‚Äôve noticed a very slight increase in impressions/clicks, whether or not it‚Äôs resulted in sales, I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs worth the effort. Not to mention that there are paid courses you could do for photography and design that at the end will give you badges through the Learn section of Fiverr, although I‚Äôm not sure how much this could improve sales.
All in all, I have to say there is so much more you could be doing to improve your odds if you really wanted to, but like many, don‚Äôt invest the time and expect immediate sales. Good luck!",N/A,"Aug 22, 2020 3:56 pm",2020-08-24 10:14:35.828057

Although I don‚Äôt agree with my description being the problem (as I stated and showed in my print, people DO NOT click on my ads), I think I can change the hopefully part. As for saying I‚Äôm new to Fiverr, I thought it was a relevant thing to say because the buyers might find it strange that I don‚Äôt have any ratings (well, I have one now from the only order I got).
So my gig covers look like Power Point stuff? Sounds awful. That was the only way I found to showcase my work though (before and after pictures).
Taking classes here on Fiverr are out of the question. The job I offer as a photo retoucher isn‚Äôt a new thing and I think my portfolio shown in the link I provide can speak for itself. I sometimes do some courses to improve my skills but overall I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs also been doing fine in other sites. My only problem has been here on Fiverr. But as you stated, I do think my covers might be the problem, since people don‚Äôt click on them.
Will surely fix that soon.
Again, I appreciate your advice.

As for practical tips, I would make a change on your gig, pay attention to your analytics, and revise the strategy if you are not generating more clicks. This could be anything (an improved thumbnail, clearer description, different pricing, etc).

I know several Animation / Rigging / Model specialists that already have a portfolio that would handle this request. In fact, I‚Äôm watching one of them do live rigging on Picarto as we speak.
Some requests are only going to be suitable to people who have the infrastructure, engine, and portfolio already in place. That‚Äôs just the reality. Once those assets are developed, adapting and re-skinning them might only be a couple hours of work.
Remember that BR‚Äôs are also there for people who don‚Äôt know who they should be reaching out to. They searched, they didn‚Äôt find the specific expertise that they needed, so they‚Äôre making a custom offer.
It isn‚Äôt always meant for you, even if it seemingly falls into your realm of expertise. Sometimes the client is looking for someone who has already made the cookie cutter, not someone who wants to bang out a custom mold.",N/A,"Aug 24, 2020 8:11 am",2020-08-24 10:14:55.224150

I get this now and then, too. I recently had someone message me about an order I had completed last summer (2019!) And they didn‚Äôt want to place another order because it was a small change and they had already paid me once. I told them to take a hike and they did, and I never heard anything about it after that.

Have you ever considered getting rid of free revisions and ordering very cheap revisions or free revisions on a case by case basis?
Thank you. I‚Äôve always felt that no revisions (free or otherwise) policy is closing the door into the buyer‚Äôs face a little bit. You have to give them just a little wiggle room so they feel included in the process. Plus, most of the revisions I get are really minor.

If it‚Äôs a returning customer, my best advice for you is to say in a very gentle way that a customer has 3 days to ask a revision before the order autocompletes, but that exceptionally you are going to make the small edits that they are asking for.
I tried this once and the person proceeded with requesting a new revision a few hours before order would autocomplete to drag it out to ensure her entire team and all the sponsors had enough time to review the delivery. The revision consisted of changing the price of the product because everyone involved couldn‚Äôt agree on it. The entire process took 11 days. It was a semi-regular but I ended up blocking her after that. I didn‚Äôt care to find out whether she misunderstood what I meant by 3 days or only pretended that she did.

This makes you a considerate seller. But have you considered not even mentioning revisions in your gig? My policy is very simple - I don‚Äôt mention revisions in my gig description, but if a buyer comes back to me with a reasonable request then I will sort it without any problems or bad feeling on my part. In other words, I‚Äôm happy to do reasonable revisions when politely asked to do so - I just don‚Äôt advertise it. I still get enough orders to keep me ticking along.

I too have experienced this. It‚Äôs rare for me to have a holiday, but whenever I do I always put my gigs on hold one week before I‚Äôm due to depart - partly so I don‚Äôt have last minute orders, and partly so I can start to unwind and get in the holiday mood.
There was one memorable occasion three summers ago when I made the mistake of checking my email on the morning I was due to leave for the airport to go on holiday - and I saw a Fiver notification from a client who wanted some revisions. The stress that caused was horrible as the client‚Äôs order had autocompleted 10 days previously.

. But have you considered not even mentioning revisions in your gig?
This topic touches a huge nerve for me!! I mean HUGE!
I completely revised my requirements after the last straw! A buyer came back and said, ‚Äúcan I use my free revision for another take with this (almost completely different) script?‚Äù By the way, I made him place another order after gently explaining this is a new read because of the changes.
Sometimes I turn it around and ask the buyer what they would do, ‚Äúthis is a tricky situation. Since the changes are not my errors and it would require more time in the studio because of the change, to me it‚Äôs a new order. What would you do Dave? I will leave it up to you.‚Äù 9 out of 10 times they place a new order because they know in their heart it‚Äôs wrong to take advantage.
However, I always feel my blood boiling and steam fogging up my glasses!!!
You can take care of this ‚Äúrevision‚Äù issue in your requirements. I make every buyer agree to my terms and agree that they understand what a revision is! Some of you have seen this:
The key is to have the buyer take responsibility for the outcome too!
Nothing is FREE! Who started saying that on Fiverr??? You can‚Äôt walk into Walmart and say, ‚Äúgee I‚Äôd like to have my free gallon of milk!‚Äù
It‚Äôs a business!
I recently had several people hang me up in revision mode and it says ‚Äúlate‚Äù in BIG RED LETTERS every time I log in! I hate that. I have no idea if that affects the algorithm but it would make sense. The only way around it is to send the same file over and over.

That‚Äôs totally true.
In a perspective of learning too, since you are also a voice over artist, may I ask you how would you handle a situation like this:
I had a situation where the buyer asked me to do a recording expressing an emotion. I made additional questions because it was a subjective one but he simply answered ‚Äúdo your best‚Äù, he was warned about the revisions (because I have a similar information at my requirements) and after delivery he asked me a free revision because he wanted me to express that emotion in a different way. Because I had to record again the entire script I asked an extra fee for the revision. I ended with a bad review.
What would be the best way to explain the situation to the buyer, in your perspective, to avoid a bad review?
melissaharlowvo:
I have no idea if that affects the algorithm but it would make sense. The only way around it is to send the same file over and over. Does anyone know if the ####LATE#### message affects anything (‚Ä¶)
I guess if affects the way your GIG will perform on search, because it‚Äôs related with the end result - if you delivered an order on time or not - but this is just my opinion. I‚Äôm not absolutely sure about that. If someone could provide additional information, that would be great.

In a perspective of learning too, since you are also a voice over artist, may I ask you how would you handle a situation like this:
I had a situation where the buyer asked me to do a recording expressing an emotion. I made additional questions because it was a subjective one but he simply answered ‚Äúdo your best‚Äù, he was warned about the revisions (because I have a similar information at my requirements) and after delivery he asked me a free revision because he wanted me to express that emotion in a different way. Because I had to record again the entire script I asked an extra fee for the revision. I ended with a bad review.
I have found that emotion is different for everyone. Italians speak with a lot of passion and emotion Americans like a more natural tone. This is the core of what we do as voice artists. So, I also include a checklist in my requirements. It includes tones they can check and they can check more than one. This gives me a better clue to what they are thinking. I also just added a check list of who is the audience which helps tremendously! So with all this information, I do my best to create the right tone. I send samples to all buyers not just the big ones. Samples help both of us determine what they are looking for. I will send screen shots of the new checklists.
Rarely do I charge anyone for a re-read because I should be able to get the right tone if I‚Äôm really trying to communicate with the buyer. If they say ‚Äúfree revision‚Äù it does make me question the buyer. I will resend samples until I get it right.
The fascinating thing is that the more I stretch myself for a buyer (but in a genuine way after all the back and forth) the more I get a tip. So if you charge more for the additional read you may risk a poor review (which can be devastating and avoid that at all cost) but if you just suck it up and do it, a tip is almost certain. So if it‚Äôs the money you are going for, just make the client happy. But after every situation like that, I go right to my requirements and tweak them so we don‚Äôt have the mis communication again. Slowly but surely I am weeding those buyers out.
I hope this helps.",N/A,"Aug 23, 2020 12:17 pm",2020-08-24 10:16:43.802369

I hope this helps.
Thank you so much. That helped a lot. When I talk about buyers wanting free revisions I‚Äôm talking about situations when I realise that people have no clue about what they want and they ask me a new recording just because. Fortunately, most of my clients know what they want. But sometimes I have people that are unable to tell me what tone they want and after the first recording they say ‚Äúoh, you need to read with more passion‚Äù and once I deliver the file they want to get back to a neutral recording again and I clearly understand thay they just want 3 versions of the same script because they didn‚Äôt decided yet what they want. So, I believe that addapting and improving my requirements is going to help a lot to prevent this type of situations. Regarding small corrections to the recording, I don‚Äôt offer free revisions at my GIGs but if it‚Äôs something that I can do easly I immediately do it. And yes, usually that makes me end receiving a tip.
Thank you so much for your valuable help.",N/A,"Aug 24, 2020 1:56 am",2020-08-24 10:16:44.566496

If you have ‚Äúunlimited revisions‚Äù basically yes (if you mean text position and image position), unless you want to cancel. The best thing would be to change the gig so it doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúunlimited revisions‚Äù so the problem won‚Äôt happen as much with future orders.
As long as they‚Äôre not creating new flyers/banners each time. As long as it‚Äôs a modification to the existing one they requested. If it‚Äôs totally new text (eg. advertising a different product/event than they requested or outside the scope of what they requested originally, then you could say no to that).
edit: if they‚Äôre asking for something not in the package then you can decline that. If it‚Äôs the facebook ads gig, the basic package does specify ‚Äúimage editing‚Äù.
edit2: I‚Äôd change the gig so revisions are around, 3, 4, 5 for the basic, standard, premium packages.(or maybe 4,5,6 if you preferred).",N/A,"Aug 24, 2020 4:23 am",2020-08-24 10:17:40.637328

Read what I said again.
Your being online isn‚Äôt the reason someone buys from you. Your being online doesn‚Äôt make someone want your service.
If a seller has something they want AND you are online, maybe. But being online can only help you if people actually want what you‚Äôre selling. And most buyers don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre online.
But you‚Äôre assuming someone buys something ONLY because the person online and not even considering that maybe you‚Äôre superfluous and maybe you‚Äôre not credible or in demand.
And you‚Äôre assuming being online a lot compensated your being superfluous and unattractive to buyers.
It doesn‚Äôt.
Sellers would perform better if they stopped obsessing about time spent online, social media posts, etc. And actually researched their market and understood it. And built services that are credible and people want to buy.",N/A,"Aug 24, 2020 3:45 am",2020-08-24 10:18:31.768626

Depending on how much longer the project would take me (1 day vs. 1 week), I‚Äôd choose between those two things to do:
Make sure the buyer accepts an offer of $60 before mutually canceling the offer of $120.
Tell the buyer they can‚Äôt cancel when I‚Äôve already started and that they have to accept the delivery anyway.
Really, the buyer can‚Äôt just stop the project because they no longer need it/want it. That‚Äôs not how Fiverr works and not eligible under the Terms of Service, but if the buyer is still willing to pay you half for the work you‚Äôve done, not too big of a deal, I suppose. You may even reach out to CS in the hopes your cancellation won‚Äôt harm your stats.

CS should be able to cancel the order without it affecting your completion stats (unlike if you cancelled the order yourself). However, what they are unlikely to do, based on feedback I‚Äôve read on the forums previously, is make half the the payment to you. They are likely to refund the entire amount and advise that your client will have make a new order for $60.
@graphtersawyer is right when she says make sure your client places a new order for $60 before the old order is cancelled - however getting your buyer to part with more money upfront might be easier said than done.
Sadly there are many dishonest people who once refunded will simply walk away with all their money and you will never hear from them again.",N/A,"Aug 23, 2020 4:10 am",2020-08-24 10:18:46.432269

Yes. It‚Äôs either specifically says so in ToS or I got a confirmation from fiverr CS about it (I don‚Äôt remember). But the new offer should be accepted before the old one is cancelled so you‚Äôre guaranteed a payment according to fiverr.
You can send them the message that you confirm that you will accept their cancellation request for the order number X within Y hours after they send it if they‚Äôre distrustful.",N/A,"Aug 23, 2020 4:17 am",2020-08-24 10:18:46.826724
