I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!

PS: here is a link in the post where I explain some detail if you want to read more: Just passed 40k earned on Fiverr!",N/A,2,"Sep 2, 2020 11:05 am",melissaharlowvo,16,"@mrssingmeasong the first goal was to make $20 a day, then $30 up to $200 a day. Yesterday was $400.
I realized soon that working myself to death for $10 was not going to get me to $200 a day.
I had a mindset that people were paying me for me to gain experience and to get solid reviews. I knew that was the key to Fiverr. I was working on other platforms to earn a little income.
When the time was right about a year into it, I raised my prices to $25. The business didn’t stop it just changed to better buyers. After about 3 months I increased it to $40 and that’s where I am now. They buyers are different at this price point and they are repeat buyers who tip.
To this day, I love the interaction with each buyer. I don’t use “auto responses” because I am a human!
When I met all the technical requirements of a Top Rated Seller I was curious why it didn’t just happen!? It’s because you are chosen based on EVERYTHING about your account. You MUST BE PROFESSIONAL IN EVERY COMMUNICATION! I was granted TRS in a month after I met the requirements and I work just as hard for $40 as I do $1,000.
My requirements have also evolved to be a good mix for the buyer ( and me) to understand each project before starting. Here they are:
Melissa Harlow VO Tone Requirement
1336×914 48.7 KB
My family also understands that I answer messages all day and night (even at 2AM)
As I can afford it, I upgrade equipment, training and education. I have a few Fiverr buddies who I communicate with to share stories and frustrations lol!
Lastly, it’s taken me about five years to minimize our lives so we have no debt and pay only cash for everything. This means I can work at my own pace and actually enjoy my life. A good Fiverr buddy asked me what my back up plan is during slow times and because of my simple living philosophy I said, “to go out and enjoy life because the slow times are small gifts of time to rest and rejuvenate without the worry of bills and a boss!
I hope you find this helpful and maybe comforting. Melissa","https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/fiverr/original/4X/a/1/c/a1c0a20e20a5d8c57aa2b0f60553439b9765037b.png

do you have some sort of “rules” regarding revisions and extras explained in your gigs or do buyers see them in requirements for the first time?
What a great question! I do NOT explain the revision policy in my description but I do cover it in the FAQ section. I think my price point steers away the buyers who are willing to take advantage of revisions. I have had NO cancellations since instituting all of these requirements. In fact, I think it helps buyers think through what they need.
I really believe the key to a successful project is having the buyer take responsibility for the outcome too. There has to be solid communication for an online collaboration to work. I wish more sellers would take on this kind of stand. It’s being “firm but fair” and I think people respect you for that.

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!

Inspiring Journey. Best of luck
I think that’s a good description… a journey. My travels across the ocean in our sailboat prepared me for any hardships. I came back a different person and just don’t sweat the small stuff. When you visit families on remote islands who by most 1st world standards have very little possessions, you realize that happiness is the real wealth. People great you with caring because it’s the right thing to do.
When you sail through storms and get thrown across a boat during a violent wave, you realize that health, family and a zest for life are the most important goals. Enough money comes if you follow your passion.",N/A,"Sep 3, 2020 11:05 pm",2020-09-06 15:05:39.808944

I started Fiverr in 2018 after traveling for 2 years on a sailboat and then in an RV. I came back with NO job (because I quit), NO home and only 1 car between my husband and I.
It may not be much for some Fiverr sellers but it’s a milestone for me!
So many funny stories. So many frustrating moments. The great thing about being your own boss on Fiverr, is you can walk away and come back whenever you want with a fresh new outlook.
Thank you FIVERR and this community!!

Then right at that same moment the dog was throwing up all over the carpet! And to top that off I sent the file to the wrong buyer in the craziness of the moment! So apologies, extreme heat and dog barf were the trifecta of the day! Oh yes my sister is in the hospital too!

I tend to express a serious demeanor, because many new sellers don’t take Fiverr seriously. They usually seem to see Fiverr as a get-rich-quick site, or an “everyone will do everything for me” site. Neither of those are true, so I encourage them to think seriously. Serious effort usually results in success.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 2:13 pm",2020-09-06 15:06:53.464890

Then, perhaps now is a good time to stop relying on the Fiverr search system to provide all your orders. ALL gigs rotate in the search results. No seller is guaranteed ongoing placement on page 1.
Figure out who your target customers are, determine where they are located, research their needs to better understand them, and then go to wherever they are, and convince them to hire you. Sitting around waiting for orders from the Fiverr search system is not how Fiverr freelancers become successful. You need to be willing to connect to you target customers, and you need to be willing to do this as a businessman, not just as a Fiverr seller.
fahadkhan1990:
impressions and no order at all. My work is going on with my previous clients.
This is the goal of any businessman – to have repeat customers. Why do so many sellers here on Fiverr think this is a bad thing? If buyers keep coming back to hire you, then you’re doing pretty well.
fahadkhan1990:
Can any one here guide me what to do or if anyone has experienced the same thing?
We all experience the same thing, however, it is your responsibility to reach out and connect to the people you are trying to sell your services to. None of us can make that happen for you.

Fiverr might see this as one person having multiple accounts. I recommend contacting Customer Support directly and asking them. If they know your situation, and you can prove that you don’t have more than one account, they might allow it. Generally, though, based on past experiences, expressed by other sellers here on the forums, Fiverr often flags multiple accounts from the same household, because they have no way of knowing that those accounts are not from the same person.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 2:03 pm",2020-09-06 15:07:08.149575

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey

No seller is entitled to orders and success, just because they have 100% positive metrics. Fiverr does not guarantee orders, or success here, and it is not their job to make sure you have customers. It is also extremely unwise to underprice yourself, because that removes you revenue, and provides no benefit to you, as a seller. Charge what you are worth, and find customers who agree with that price, and are willing to hire you to solve their project needs.
If you want to be successful, think like like a businessman. Think upwards, not down into the bottom of the barrel. Cheap prices will result in cheap customers. The goal is always to offer quality work, so find the quality buyers that need that work.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 1:13 pm",2020-09-06 15:08:20.363594

My comments remain valid. According to Fiverr’s terms of service, you are not entitled to a refund of a delivered order. You keep trying to force the seller to cancel. He/she does not have to do so. There is nothing wrong with the seller declining your demands for a post-delivery refund.
keithkaren:
fiverr should not allow a cancelation request to keep going in circles after the 2nd time they should automatically step in as this can be endless!!!
You’re advocating to force a seller to cancel an order that he/she clearly does not want to – nor is required to – cancel. That’s not going to happen, and the seller is well within his/her rights to keep declining your demands.

If you stop demanding refunds, the order should autocomplete in 3 days. At that point, you should be able to leave a review.",N/A,"Sep 5, 2020 11:11 pm",2020-09-06 15:09:36.037971

After the pandemic began Fiverr saw a surge of new sellers. Because of that customer service has been short handed and they are taking ten days to two weeks to reply. Plus, if you send a request more than once the whole ticket goes to the spam file.

There is no need to “shout” at me, or “scream” that I am incorrect. You stated nothing, before this quoted comment, about unlimited revisions being part of the service you hired. I, and others who respond here, can only respond according to the information you choose to share. We cannot read your mind to understand the details you have not shared. My previous comments, therefore, continue to remain true – based upon the previous complaints you have made.
Now that you’ve chosen to share more details, yes, I can agree with you. If the seller offers services in an order you hired them to complete, then they must, legally, provide those services. If your added details are true, then the seller MUST provide their promised unlimited revisions, and you do have a case to contest their failure to provide them.
In the future, here on the forums, please provide ALL of the information relevant to your complaints, instead of expecting us to understand your entire situation, based only upon partial details.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 12:42 am",2020-09-06 15:09:38.359334

seller has not fulfilled their contract and has not even done 1 revision!!!
The one day delivery doesn’t actually suggest that the unlimited revisions will be delivered within 1 day but rather the initial delivery will be done within one day. There is no time limit to unlimited revisions.
You said you are trying to accept the order but it doesn’t work. I think that might be because the revision request is still open? Since the seller hasn’t delivered the revision yet. So in order for you to be able to accept the order, you would have to ask the seller to either send the revision or to send the initial delivery again so that you can accept it. Then you may leave a review you see fit for the service you received.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 9:32 am",2020-09-06 15:09:39.114991

SO THINK WHAT YOU WANT BUT I WILL NOT PAY FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT RECEIVE!!!
I should note, you DID receive what you ordered – there was a delivery for services hired. You wanted something else/better after delivery, you were unwilling to work on persist on the “unlimited revisions” issue (you gave up on that), and then began demanding refunds. Revisions aside, the seller is entitled to be paid for work he/she has already done and delivered, regardless of whether you like that work or not. You are only entitled to revisions, which you didn’t press.
Fiver does state, in their TOS, that buyers are not entitled to refunds or cancellations (if the work was provided as promised – which it sounds like it likely was). You are not owed a cancellation or refund, but you are legally entitled to revisions. You cannot make demands for things that do not coincide with the terms of Fiverr, or the terms of the order you hired the seller to complete.
Press the seller for revisions. He offers them at the unlimited level. Fiverr will likely support you on this issue, but it is your responsibility to work out a conclusion with the seller. Remind him/her of his/her unlimited revisions term, and remind him/her that he/she MUST provide them, according to Fiverr’s terms. He/she MUST provide unlimited revisions; he/she does not have to give you a refund.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 12:44 pm",2020-09-06 15:09:43.641779

If all you want to do at this point is to get your funds back, you can stop waiting to rate the seller and just dispute the charge on your credit card. Your Fiverr account would likely get banned after that, since it would be a ToS violation, but you would get your funds back.
Or, if you wish to try something that doesn’t involve a ToS violation, you can ask for an update on the same ticket that you’ve already submitted (don’t submit a new ticket for the same problem, that just slows things down), and/or you can try contacting Fiverr on their social media with the ticket number and (politely!) ask for someone to look into it.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 1:31 pm",2020-09-06 15:09:44.030096

Your topic title is “Noob in Fiverr Marketplace”. One other bit of advice, if you want to be a successful seller, don’t refer to yourself as a “noob”. You are seeking to become a professional businessman freelancer. Businessmen/women do not call themselves “noobs”. No one takes a “noob” seriously, and I’m guessing you want people to take you seriously.
If you view yourself as a “noob”, so will your buyers… and buyers don’t hire “noobs”.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 1:24 pm",2020-09-06 15:09:50.292315

Fiverr is an extremely competitive marketplace. The first step in success is to realize that you (or any seller) are not entitled to orders just because you want them. You are going to have to out-compete those other sellers. You are going to have to be better than the other sellers who offer the same services you offer.
philip_philip:
Please can someone list what I need to know and do when having conversation with a buyer who contacted me directly through gig ( and not through buyer’s request).
The answer is simple: Communicate honestly, and address the buyer’s needs while offering a service that resolves those needs. No one can tell you how YOU need to do this, because YOU need to find what works for you. How I connect with my customers, for example, is not going to work for you. Be genuine, be respectful, be honest, be helpful, be you.

No, that isn’t necessary. Just connect. Be the seller who solves their project needs.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 12:56 pm",2020-09-06 15:09:55.363346

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey
Fiverr Stories
I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller. A little about myself first- I am a 27 yr old digital marketer and joined Fiverr last September. I’ve been jumping forth and back from New Seller to Level 1 (credit to the order completion rate). I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of…

Knowing your customers = knowing what your target customers want. Position your gig to reach your target customers. For example (very simple example), offering lower prices to reach customers who are looking for the cheapest prices, or offering higher prices to position yourself as a premium option to reach customers who are looking for quality.

Not a given to everyone. Some sellers offer gigs in which they have no professional skills.

Outside of Fiverr, social media. When it’s done right, it can be huge. Offering insight on LinkedIn, gaining a following for your work on Instagram… selling without selling. It gets a bad rep here on the forum because people think it means spamming Twitter.

Fiverr’s a bit different - it’s a different market, a different pricing scale … and a totally different way of working.
I’ve taken a look at your profile … the vegas crowd are not going to seek out your services here. Your job is to work out a target market that does come to Fiverr for the kind of services you offer. You’re not going to be able to do a cold reading on them - communication outside Fiverr is verboten - nor will you be able to persuade them with your charm (for the same reason). Background searches are difficult in a situation where everyone is anonymous.
So who is likely to search out the type of services you offer, here on Fiverr?

I have already noted the reason. Sellers with no seller level do not see many buyer requests that they can respond to. You will, however, see plenty to consider when you are promoted to a Level 1 seller. There is no other reason. Sellers with no seller level are not able to see any/many buyer requests.

You’re either not standing out enough in the SERPs to get clicks on your gig, or you’re getting clicks on your gig, but something about your offering and positioning isn’t connecting with buyers.
I know it’s frustrating, but it’s on you to figure out which of those is the case, and then fix it.
Check your gig analytics for the past couple of months. Look at your Impressions and Clicks, and see how they stand-up. Does it look like traffic is your issue? If so, yeah… maybe investing in some more eye-catching thumbnails is the way forward. If you’re getting the clicks, then you need to pull your gigs apart and figure out why what you’re offering isn’t resonating with your potential customers.
Maybe your Description needs rewriting? Perhaps you need to add videos?

Sounds like Fiverr, for whatever reason, doesn’t deem you relevant to your target audience. Not ‘popular’ or ‘unpopular’, but not relevant. You’ve got to convince the SERP that you are in fact relevant, and I would think the way you do that is to improve your conversion rate, with the traffic that you do get.
I had a (very brief) look at your gigs. The only comment I would make is that I’m a visual person, and your images look pretty ‘stock’ (ie; not telling me anything, just there to provide something visual). Your Descriptions look great, but I didn’t stop to read them, and others may well do the same.
How about taking the time to create some videos? Nothing too glossy; You, your phone, talking to camera… “Hi, this is who I am, this is the issue that I think you’re facing, this is what I can do for you…” etc. Show people you’re a real person, who understands their issues, and make it easy for people to order from you.

The challenge for all of us here, is that we’ve got to play multiple roles… Entrepreneur, Accountant, Marketing Manager, Actor… and that’s on top of the work that you actually do. Your service is your product, and you have to package it in a way that makes people want to buy it, just like you would if you were selling a brand of beer, or a new car, or your services as a builder…
I totally understand what you’re saying about not being comfortable in front of the camera, but it doesn’t change the fact that people need to be convinced to buy your service. Sadly, you can’t skip that part of the equation. Perhaps your next step should be to utilise the abundance of services on Fiverr to get a video made for you?

I think it’s a Catch-22, personally. Fiverr like to bet on easy-wins. If they send you traffic and you don’t convert it, they’ll send you less traffic. The opposite is also true.

@donaldfaulknor
I don’t think you should focus too much on your gig images.
Because the more you work on them, the more you will be disappointed if/when that fails too.
In my opinion, you should be focusing on your positioning.
I am not computer illiterate and yet I can’t really see why I need a PHP developer.
I also don’t know many people who want to build a social network. (Well I do, but none of them have any money or a profitable idea)
So why not focus on either modifying your one gig that got a sale or creating a new one, and focus on the key benefit.
People don’t know what PHP is, or how valuable good SEO is, but they can understand what a blog is and they can see there’s potential to make money off of one.
So figure out a way to offer what most people would want and understand.
Your PHP gig for example, is just a list of technical terms that Fiverr’s algorithm deemed irrelevant.",N/A,"Sep 3, 2020 11:37 am",2020-09-06 15:13:41.346915

So you do understand that said audience is not a great one at the moment.
And your price tag for that particular gig, is too low.
People with money will not trust you, people without any money will jump at the chance to micromanage you till you can’t work anymore.

You could make a video without featuring your face (footage of work process, some animation, stock videos on topic with words floating around, anything) and hire a voice actor/ask someone to narrate a text about what you do without implying that this is your voice.

Had my first order within a week after answering a buyers request. My prices back in 2017 were a joke compared to the actual work and time I spend on the order but hey, I got my first review. From there I started to not only deliver professional looking videos, I also created a professional workflow, worked on how to speak with potential clients, created good looking gig images, quick replies and a huge portfolio as well as an outstanding sales-video. In 2020, so almost 3 years later, I created my first social media page for the service (hell, that was the first time I even looked into how to market a service). Until then I was already a top rated seller making a full-time living working on fiverr. So, from experience I can tell you, you are wrong. You don’t need any external traffic or huge following to success on fiverr.

Fair enough, avoid anything which in any way implies that the person is you. But having a person and/or voice over provide an explanation for a video that you then happen to use on your gig? I really don’t see why that would be an issue.

While that’s a sort of specific genre, I honestly think that’s what ended up working for me: having gigs that target a specific service, often one where the demand exceeds the supply. Before I made the switch, I was in a sea of a bunch of other 3D artists, many of whom with bigger portfolios, more experience, or they were willing to make $10 for 15+ hrs of work. Since specializing, I have much less competition, especially in the streaming graphics space where most artists have a very different style than mine. I’m catering to a very specific audience, and receiving results!
Of course this is from an artist’s perspective, so I’m not quite sure exactly how this would translate over to your industry and specialty. At the base of what I’m trying to say is that having gigs that serve a specific niche or purpose can really help.

My gig was at the first page for some time, even when it had only a single review, so they actually do have some boosts and support for new sellers.

Fiverr’s search system does not provide any kind of rank. Thus, it cannot be manipulated for ranking purposes. It is a dynamic system that provides different results for each person who searches for something. What you see when you search for something, is not what someone else sees. The results are determined based upon many factors, including relevance to each searcher.
It is, therefore, extremely irresponsible to expect the Fiverr search system to provide all of the sales you want. Take responsibility for your own success, step outside of the Fiverr box (or, some might call this, “your comfort zone” or expectations), and MAKE your success happen. Make it happen wherever your target customers are located. You will not be successful sitting back and doing the easy things. That’s not how Fiverr, business, or freelance success works.
Complain less, and be more creative and ambitious. You’ve likely heard the phrase, “fortune favors the bold”. Well, be bold. Be bold in your actions, instead of normal in your expectations.
No one – not even Fiverr – owes you the success you seek. You earn that on your own, measured only in YOUR level of ambition, creativity, perseverance, sacrifice, investment, and ongoing determination. Stop complaining and start doing.",N/A,"Sep 3, 2020 10:44 pm",2020-09-06 15:13:59.862934

All sellers on 5r knows how important reviews are, so for him to have given you less than 5 is puzzling.
As a long time buyer on this platform, I always look for clues to see who I should stay away from.
In order for me to have found a list of great sellers, I had to filter thru and waste quite a bit of money on whole slew of scammers, amateurs, and really difficult sellers. Some I just accepted the order to get rid of them.
Why am I telling you this? If you had tons of reviews as seller and buyer it’s no big deal, but as it stands, some buyers may associate you as being difficult. With so much competition, I’ll go to someone else.
It’s too bad you can’t explain your side as a buyer like you can as a seller.",N/A,"Sep 4, 2020 12:02 am",2020-09-06 15:14:00.228201

Well, I don’t get any messages from potential clients. So, definitely not the way I communicate with them. I’ve only had 2 people see my gigs in the last few months. So, I don’t even have the opportunity to sell my gigs.
You’re looking at this the wrong way. Communication isn’t just directly talking to a potential client in your inbox.
You already communicate through your gig image and title (as that’s what they’ll see first), then through your gig pages and profile (if they scroll through). If what you communicate in all those instances, appeals to people who browse your category, or search for gigs, they might contact you. (*)
You do have the opportunity to sell your gigs, your opportunity to sell your gigs starts with setting up your gigs and profile, not when people contact you. They won’t contact you if your gigs and profile don’t appeal to them.
Once you’ve managed to create gigs that appeal to people enough that they click, and what they see then appeals to them as well, and they contact you, then you have another opportunity to convert the inquiry into a sale.
But there are also many sellers who sell gigs even without any contact with the buyer, they just directly order the gig without even talking to the seller at all.
No matter how you turn it, first, your gigs need to be relevant and appealing enough for your target group to click on.
You can have seven gigs as a level 0 seller. So you even have ample opportunity to try out different approaches regarding smaller or bigger or medium niches at the same time.
You can get “popular” (among your target clients) on Fiverr without being popular on social media, or having been popular at high school, even to the point of having to say no to orders because you are too busy sometimes.
Unless you have something grand to offer that nobody else offers and for which there is a demand among people browsing/searching on Fiverr, or perhaps a whole lot of good luck, it usually will take work, some skills (or outsourcing skills you don’t have, like perhaps great gig images), including some people skills (when it comes to the point of potential buyers contacting you), reflection, trial and error. The willingness to openly look at what people on the forum say and to apply it, might speed things up.
(*) seeing Gina’s post, I’ll add that you even communicate through your reviews - which, of course (apart from your own replies to those reviews), you can only indirectly influence by what you deliver, and by your customer support and your rapport with your buyers (or your rapport with your sellers in the case of “reviews as a buyer”)
To sum it up: communication (in the broad sense as detailed above) is key. No matter how fantastic your actual trade know-how might be, if you can’t communicate that your gigs are worth clicking on/contacting you, chances are you won’t get direct orders nor the second-layer opportunity to convince potential clients at the stage of direct inbox communication.",N/A,"Sep 4, 2020 8:25 am",2020-09-06 15:14:00.956019

Your analogy is illogical and incorrect.
Yes when you pay someone to cut your grass, you expect your grass to be cut. But you aren’t paying Fiverr to promote and sell. That’s not what the 20% is for. You just decided that it is.
And how could Fiverr rank and sell things that buyers don’t want. If there are hundreds of thousands of sellers paying a 20% commission, how can they all rank well and make sales when there are more buyers than sellers?
Your 20% doesn’t mean Fiverr hands you orders because if they ran their business that way they’d go bankrupt. They rank things based on what suits their business objectives, not yours.
Fiverr is not a membership for getting sales.
Instead of ranting that Fiverr doesn’t hand you sales, it would be more effective for you to learn how business, sales and marketplaces actually works.
And it’s utterly absurd that you insist being popular on social media is what get sales. Stop whining about things that aren’t even true.",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 10:54 am",2020-09-06 15:14:09.435500

From an SEO standpoint, I’ll tell you that your gig has a lot of space it isn’t using! You get 1200 characters and you’re using 234 of them. The same goes for your title, as well - you could fit more keywords or searchable phrases in there.
Why do I want your caricatures? Maybe they make a great birthday present, anniversary present, retirement present, etc. Maybe I want to get caricatures done for all of my employees to use on our “about us” page on the company website. Maybe I need one for my logo. Clients are generally very need/project focused, which means you have to use the language THEY are using to search for you. As an example, I’m a writer, and I have to spellcheck myself on the word caricature nearly every time - I might look for “cartoon portrait” instead.
Also, I always recommend that sellers check out their best-performing competition to see where they’re falling short on their own gigs. Look at the long description on this gent’s work, here: https://www.fiverr.com/exofarartwork/make-amazing-caricature-style-from-your-photo?context_referrer=search_gigs&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=a2092df9-a583-4f6b-a676-0533f059b17a&pckg_id=1&pos=1&context_type=rating&funnel=778cafa2-bb82-4041-ac1a-d5637b479a52
Now, your work is super, super good. Talent isn’t what’s holding you back, here - it’s just attracting the right sets of eyes on your gig. Don’t get caught up in analytics and algorithms - I think I’ve literally checked mine like 5 times since I started a year ago, out of idle curiosity; I don’t let them kick up my anxiety. If I notice work isn’t coming in, I hit buyer requests, advertise on Twitter, reach out to old clients that might need recurring work. I focus on what I can change, rather than what I can’t",N/A,"Sep 6, 2020 10:24 am",2020-09-06 15:14:15.150925

gig performance impressions

While my best performing gig has hundreds of impressions everyday, they seem rather steady but something happened that made them increase a lot on Wednesday.
My least performing gig only gets 20 impressions or so at best (which I’m not mad about) but the numbers seem a lot less consistent, probably more randomized.
I don’t know if it means anything in your case, but randomized impressions could be a reason for new sellers to not get consistent orders.
