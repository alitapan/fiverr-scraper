Without a clear brief, how can any seller know what their buyer wants? You just took a guess, and the client didn’t like the result.
If a buyer doesn’t communicate - even after asking them for a brief, the best thing to do is to ask customer support to cancel the order. If you can clearly show that the client has not sent instructions, then CS can cancel an order without it affecting your stats. This is discretionary on their part though.
However, by blindly carrying on and guessing what the client wants you are simply wasting your time. In your case, the buyer eventually took control by requesting a cancellation. Had you instead taken control, you might have saved your stats.",,"Aug 14, 2020 4:58 am",2020-08-14 22:43:05.330881

But I quickly searched on fiverr forum itself if there is any way I could save my order completion. Every thread said there is no way to do that, even customer support. So I agreed to cancel the order and added on the very top of my gig to communicate with me before placing an order in Bold capital letters. But if it is true that you can save your completion rate, I will definitely look more into it the next time.
