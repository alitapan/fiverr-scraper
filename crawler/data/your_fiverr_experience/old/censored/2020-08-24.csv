However, it’s a region with a long and interesting history, so there are many places to check.

First of all, it’s a part of my (and many other people’s) childhood .
It’s a very interesting and cautionary tale.
The story follows the experiences of a mongoose named Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (from his chattering vocalizations) after he becomes the pet of a British family residing in India. He becomes friendly with some of the other creatures inhabiting the garden and is warned of the cobras Nag and Nagaina, who are angered by the human family’s presence on their territory.

I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of…

I’m sick and tired of reading one sentence bids. I’m sick and tired of writers with grammar errors bidding. I’m sick and tired of proofreaders, who misspell “proofread” bidding.
