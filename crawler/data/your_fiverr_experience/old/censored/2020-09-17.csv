I am a relatively new seller and I have been facing a strange problem. Initially I scored a few orders from here and there and after getting a few reviews my profile sky rocketed and I got a lot of traffic on my video editing gig. When I checked the graph I saw that I was having over 2000 impressions in a day. It was more work than I could handle so I had to refuse some clients from taking their work. After a few days my impressions dropped to just 15. From 2000 to 15 that’s a very big jump and I have not been getting much. Now I only receive orders from my permanent clients and am not getting any new messages.

I am a relatively new seller and I have been facing a strange problem. Initially I scored a few orders from here and there and after getting a few reviews my profile sky rocketed and I got a lot of traffic on my video editing gig. When I checked the graph I saw that I was having over 2000 impressions in a day. It was more work than I could handle so I had to refuse some clients from taking their work. After a few days my impressions dropped to just 15. From 2000 to 15 that’s a very big jump and I have not been getting much. Now I only receive orders from my permanent clients and am not getting any new messages.

What have I learned in my 11 months of Fiverr journey
Fiverr Stories
I read a lot of wonderful posts here but never contributed much. So, in this post, I’ll share my insights for what I’ve learned in my Fiverr journey and how can you get more orders if you are a new and level 1 seller. A little about myself first- I am a 27 yr old digital marketer and joined Fiverr last September. I’ve been jumping forth and back from New Seller to Level 1 (credit to the order completion rate). I still don’t make much from Fiverr, it’s around $150-$200/month but it pays some of…

it seems like they really want to cancel and stop working with me.
If they are that kind of sensitive, or managed to misunderstand you so much that they interpreted your standard reminder that all other buyers so far reacted to with “sure”, as a threat, and even after your apology and all don’t want to work with you on future projects, that’s probably better.
That doesn’t, however, give them the right to cancel that current order which you already finished and spent your time on, which should be obvious to anyone who has a business of doing business really. It’s absolutely reasonable of you to not cancel and keep offering modifications in a reasonable scope. Of course, this might end with a bad review then, but you have the option to reply to that review and explain things from your POV.

“Noted on this! Just to let you know, the gig includes 1 free major revision and up to 3 minor revisions, after which I charge extra. So I would suggest compiling all edits into a list so that I can do all of it at 1 time to avoid the extra charge. :)”
As for a perhaps more delicate way of wording your standard message to cater to even the most precious snowflakes - maybe change things like “Just to let you know”, or “So I would suggest” - while it sounds harmless enough to me, there are people who’ll see an offence, threat, or whatever, in anything.
Perhaps something “softer”, like:
“Thank you for your message! The gig includes 1 free major revision and up to 3 minor revisions. If you compile all edits into a list, I can do all of it at once to save you time and the need to buy extra revisions. Looking forward to doing the edits for you :)”
“includes …” already says that anything beyond that will incur extra charges, so I don’t think you need to say that twice (“after which I charge extra”, and “to avoid the extra charge”).
However, that might then lead to more issues with people who need big signposts, and you may end up with more of those micro edit sessions again, so YMMV, maybe you can try it out.",,"Sep 9, 2020 7:46 am",2020-09-09 21:26:19.315396

Nope. It’s not threatening at all. But… I do recommend the following minor change (it just sounds better):

What happens when you dispute a buyer’s order cancellation?,Your Fiverr Experience,0,0,0,,,,https://forum.fiverr.com/t/what-happens-when-you-dispute-a-buyers-order-cancellation/514426,,vallikestodraw,,"I’ve had good luck when it comes to buyers here on Fiverr so far. So this is my first time dealing with a terrible customer. I have delivered the requested work on time and did what was agreed. But the buyer suddenly wants to cancel because he felt “threatened” when I politely informed him about my revision policy and suggested he compile all his comments into a list so I can edit everything at one time. (I have shown the interaction to random people for feedback if I was rude or not as english is not my first language, and have been told that I was quite polite and just the buyer was overreacting)
I have apologized repeatedly and even offered unlimited revisions to placate him. But he has been unreasonable and repeatedly insisted I give him a refund. Which I refused as I have done nothing wrong and delivered the work on time and as discussed. So he has initiated a cancellation on his end. I just want to know, what happens if I dispute the cancellation?
Am I forced to continue to work with that buyer on the gig until he is satisfied? Or will the interaction with the buyer end and he gets the files and I receive my due payment?
I just want to know, because frankly, sometimes it is not worth the amount of money from the gig to have stress and trigger my anxiety to continue to deal with an unreasonable buyer who will probably continue to ask for revisions out of spite if I need to continue working with them to receive payment.",,,,,,,,,2020-09-09 21:26:23.599336

Welcome to Fiverr, to start with. It’s wisdom to be and remain online as many Buyers would prefer to engage Sellers who are “available” by being online. While waiting, there are tons of what to do to increase your chances of clinching jobs. Won’t be a bad idea to search through the forum archives and implement those measures. Note that many Sellers, irrespective of level, do have “dry spells” (period of no Orders) from time to time. For me, at such times, I look around for what else to do, to brighten my chances of getting hired. Lastly, don’t be discouraged for not getting hired days after joining Fiverr. It took some weeks and for others, months to make first sale. No assurances when it’d happen. And you could get hired in a few hours you never know.",,"Sep 9, 2020 6:59 am",2020-09-09 21:27:03.139403

So this happen last night.

I requested him to cancel or pay the full price and extend the deadline as per the premium gig.
He refueses and threatened me with a bad review.

I am constantly requesting him to cancel both orders but he is constantly refusing and forcing me.

Hi @umar_shoaib1210,
Until you hear from CS, keep sending your buyer a cancellation request, no matter how many times he refuses to.
Please don’t keep opening tickets. CS is taking up to 10 days, or longer, to respond, due to the amount of work they’re having since the pandemic started.
I don’t know if in any of your open tickets you told CS your buyer was blackmailing you with leaving a bad review. In case you didn’t, go to the corresponding ticket and explain CS the situation, attaching proof of what you’re saying.",,"Sep 9, 2020 2:24 pm",2020-09-09 21:29:29.453364

I think you could’ve outsourced the work if you had gotten them to agree to paying extra and getting an extension on the delivery date, and for the last one, it would’ve been as simple as installing GIMP and spending 10-15 minutes freehanding the selection and deleting the background.
